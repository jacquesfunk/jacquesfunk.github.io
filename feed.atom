        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The FIA's priority for much of the 2024 Formula 1 season was cracking down on drivers' foul language over the radio and in press conferences. The word fuck, it made clear, was no longer acceptable, though for Federation Internationale de l'Automobile President Mohammed Ben Sulayem's clear, dog whistle–laden stance on the matter—"We have to differentiate between our sport, motorsport, and rap music"—it was not formally codified until yesterday, Jan. 23. The new International Sporting Code recommends specific punishments for misconduct, defined as language or actions that reasonably be construed as either "offensive, insulting, coarse, rude, or abrasive," or threatening. Within any two-year period, a first offense would incur a €40,000 fine (around $41,000), a second offense would incur a €80,000 fine and a suspended one-month ban, and a third offense would incur a €120,000 fine, a one-month ban and deduction of championship points. It remains unclear what a fourth offense would entail.
A professional sports league having a codified swear jar is ludicrous at face value. Though governing bodies frequently do ludicrous things and operate on ludicrous assumptions, it remains a mystery how three swear words over the course of two years would be more damaging to the sport than suspending a driver—like, say, the notoriously potty-mouthed but four-time World Champion Max Verstappen—for a month.  Verstappen's formal punishment for swearing in Singapore last year was mandatory community service. Charles Leclerc's punishment for swearing in Mexico was a €10,000 fine, half of which was suspended for a year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I suppose I expected something more eclectic and thrilling out of this collision between two of the most innovative sentence-level orators in New York City. And when Eric Adams said, "I'm a bald-headed, earring-wearing mayor that's saying that you don't have to have this one stereotypical look to be successful" early in his hour-long interview with Stephen A. Smith, my appetite for stupid utterances was whetted. But I was soon disappointed, and in time, disgusted. When Adams began a story "I will stop in the middle of the night when barber shops close down—I will go inside, sit down, smoke a cigar, drink a little Hennessy," I thought were were going to end in a destination more interesting than complaints about "the people who are putting out the messages of what is important to the Democratic party." That's really all this conversation was: a heavily indicted man arguing that he was ideologically abandoned, and then targeted, by a political party that he keeps threatening to quit.
Sure, it's a little funny to hear Adams complain that his biggest challenge as mayor is the fact that the media doesn't acknowledge his successes. It's a little funny to see him play the hits, like the "haters and waiters" spiel. He is sometimes sort of accidentally correct, like when he argues that the Democratic party has largely abandoned working-class concerns. And he did have one refreshingly Adamsian turn of phrase: "When a bullet carve a highway of death in your community and it hits someone it's not a Democrat or Republican." There was room for improvement in the delivery.]]></summary>

And, sure, the most-watched and talked-about bout of the last couple years, Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul, was far more a circus than a legitimate matchup. But the sport really isn’t in a horrible place right now. There are plenty of stars deserving of a bigger audience.
Case in point: Naoya Inoue, the reigning world junior featherweight champion and an absolute superstar in his native Japan. But only in his native Japan. You likely don’t know this, but Inoue already fought today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you are light enough, the water's surface is just another place to stretch your legs. The animal kingdom abounds with water-walkers: water striders perch atop ponds with thin legs held aloft with the help of water-repelling hair; basilisk lizards can run as far as five feet across water with long toes creating buoyant pockets of air; birds called western grebes have a mating ritual that involves running for up to seven seconds across water as their wide, flat feet slap the surface. And cricket frogs were long observed to cross ponds by way of "skittering," meaning jumping across the water without sinking.
Intrigued by the frogs' water-walking prowess, a group of scientists decided to study how the amphibians managed to stay at the top of the water's surface as they skittered, findings they recently reported in a paper in the Journal of Experimental Biology. When they filmed the cricket frogs on high-speed video, the researchers learned the hard truth behind skittering. Instead of bounding across the surface like a real water-walker, the cricket frogs completely submerged themselves in water between each hop. "This study is a testament to how even processes that seem so obvious can have a lot going on underneath the surface," Jasmine Nirody, a biophysicist at the University of Chicago who was not involved with the new paper, wrote in an email.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Liam Coen has been a head coach in the National Football League for, what, several hours now, and already he has set impossibly lofty expectations for himself. As we all know, in sports your reputation isn't found in provable success as much as it in convincing people that you were better than you should have been. And for that, Coen can thank the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Jacksonville Jaguars, proving yet again that when you're looking for weird, you're looking at Florida.
Nobody outside The Other Bay Area much knew Coen before last week, but he is credited in that coachly way for the revivification of Baker Mayfield. And sure, why not? Mayfield was authentically great under Coen’s direction this season after nearly washing out of the league in the years prior; the Bucs didn't matter, then they did. Credit spreads like paint when a bad offensive team becomes a good one, and that will tend to benefit the guy who is otherwise only known as a forehead with a hat talking into a Denny's placemat. That’s Coen.]]></summary>

I am telling you this at the start of this particular blog about Nikola Jokic because I want to make it clear that we do try to exercise some self-restraint here. OK, yes, fine, we did recently publish a whole blog about the fact that Jokic slapped a basketball a great distance, but that really was crazy. We try to keep the bar high, but the problem is that Jokic just keeps doing incredible things. 
Take last night's game against the Kings, which Jokic finished with 35 points, 22 rebounds, 17 assists, and two blocks. Wilt Chamberlain is the only other player in NBA history to have put up more than 35 points, 20 rebounds, and 15 assists in a single game, and Jokic's particular stat line had never been achieved before. Nuggets fans like to track these performances, which they call Jokigamis. It feels like Jokic has been producing one every week this season.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his October 2024 introductory press conference as the new president of baseball operations of the San Francisco Giants, Buster Posey declared, "We're in the memory-making business." No matter any outsized belief in RBI, it was the strongest repudiation of the old Farhan Zaidi regime, an optimized, min-maxed platoon machine with a veritable lack of new dudes, which spent each year scuttling about trying to sneak into the Wild Card, caught lightning in a bottle in 2021, and—after showing prediction models who's boss—never broke .500 since. It doesn't matter if Matt Chapman never puts up another 7 rWAR season, or if Willy Adames is the ideal guy to drop a $182 million contract on—so long as the Giants' roster winds up with people to root for, year over year, Posey's team-building philosophy will readily outperform Zaidi's as a maker of memories.
Combine commitment to the memory-making business with an optimized, min-maxed machine, and you wind up with the Los Angeles Dodgers, who are, if you missed it, ruining baseball. Admittedly, signing a guy so fans and future fans alike will have someone to root for is a bit different from signing every guy on the market; the latter is, to simplify a bit, the Dodgers' approach to this past offseason. So far, Los Angeles has signed or extended, in a semi-rapid succession of long-term contracts: Blake Snell, Tommy Edman, Hye-seong Kim (a 25-year-old free agent with 37 career home runs in the KBO, who is not to be confused with cool Padres guy Ha-seong Kim), and then, in the span of one week, Roki Sasaki, Tanner Scott, and Kirby Yates.]]></summary>

Now he has made it through to the other side, and you know what? He still kinda feels like he was justified in punching Jordan Poole back in 2022.
This is the only logical takeaway from Green's latest podcast episode, where he once again got into the infamous altercation. After the Golden State Warriors beat the Washington Wizards in an otherwise unmemorable game—save for the fact that Poole got a warm reception from the San Francisco crowd—Poole commented on his relationship with the Warriors locker room by saying "I love those guys over there," before immediately correcting himself: "I love most of those guys over there." Green, who truly cannot help himself, took the bait, tweeting in reply "I really am sorry." Green reiterated this sentiment on the podcast saying, "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have punched him. But it happened. Let's move on."]]></summary>

Thanks to the new league-stage format, I figured that two of Europe's most expensively assembled sides would be safely through to the knockouts by this point, and that the match wouldn't have all that much riding on it.
I was wrong on two counts. First, I have to admit I did not foresee that El Gásico would be not a matchup at the top of the table, but rather a true battle of survival. Entering Wednesday's match in Paris, both clubs were in a klaxon-worthy panic, marooned in the bottom third of the 36-team table and in real jeopardy of missing the knockout round all together. My second mistake was in assuming that a PSG-City match would be anything but a banger, an intuition that seemed to bear out during the scoreless first half, only to explode into a delirious 4-2 PSG comeback win that might have been the most entertaining match of the campaign.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Oscar nominees for 2025 were announced Thursday morning. The list for Best Original Score caused a minor stir in Defector's Slack when it was observed that the score of Challengers, by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, didn't make the cut. Reznor and Ross have been nominated before, lots of times, for lots of different awards. They've won a couple Oscars already, a BAFTA, an Emmy, three Golden Globes, and probably some Grammys. The score for Challengers was well-received and memorable, and was an important part of a well-reviewed film. And like most Reznor and Ross joints, it's something a normal person might choose to bump on their car's sound system, in those moments where they feel like driving very fast. Certainly I will not be jamming out to the score of The Wild Robot, a movie I had never heard of before this morning.
Unfortunately, I am forced to rush to the defense of the Academy in this case. However jaunty and fun the rest of the Challengers score may be, the Academy was right to penalize Reznor and Ross for having created the song "Yeah x10," which is the most irritating piece of music imaginable.]]></summary>

The students were both in the same mammalogy class at the University of California, Berkeley, which included trips teaching students how to catch, handle, and process small mammals. On one such trip, Jain brought his camera and snapped some shots of voles and deer mice. Curious if there were any other small and obscure mammals nearby to photograph, Jain perused a list of the mammals of California and noticed that one species, the Mount Lyell shrew, had never been photographed before. "I was immediately fascinated," Jain said.
Jain told Subramanyan about the shrew in September, and the two hatched a scheme. Subramanyan, who has since graduated from Berkeley, is a wildlife conservation photographer and a creator in the California Academy of Science's California Creators for Nature program. Neither Jain nor Subramanyan had worked with a species like a shrew before; Subramanyan ordinarily photographs wildlife giants such as mountain lions and wolves, and Jain ordinarily photographs itty-bitty invertebrates, such as scorpions and arachnids. The small shrew offered them a chance to meet in the middle.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The further we get away from the 2016 Democratic National Convention the more I become convinced that Michelle Obama standing on that stage saying, “When they go low, we go high,” was a death knell. By now, she’s realized it. In the brief period of this past election cycle where the Democrats were trying to win, calling Donald Trump and J.D. Vance “weird”, she backed away from the statement on the convention stage. But then, just as suddenly, Democrats backed off their line of attack. Why try something new, to seeming success, when you could run the same old playbook to failure?
The reason that phrase sticks in my head is because it was a failed strategy from the get-go. If your opponent is “going low,” following the rules will not help you. You will not be given a gold star by the teacher. In fact, it will only give your opponent more space and opportunity to play dirty. The Republicans (who are winning politics, currently) know that they are in a competition, and that the Democrats are their opponents and enemies. They behave like it. Democrats, over and over again, seem to be trying to prove that they are not actually in a feud with Republicans. In their efforts at peace-keeping, they allow violence to reign. They are unable or unwilling to fight.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even prodigies must learn hard lessons in public sometimes. Carlos Alcaraz has won four major titles and extracts tennis wisdom at a disturbing rate, but there are plenty of situations on court that the 21-year-old has yet to confront. In Tuesday’s Australian Open quarterfinal against the 37-year-old Novak Djokovic, Alcaraz lost, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4, and learned how to grapple with an opponent whose injury did not prevent him from playing at a world-historical level. 
At 4-4 in the first set, Djokovic slid hard while running to his right and seemed to tweak something in his left groin, causing him to grimace and stretch it out. On his next serve, he struggled to push off the ground with that leg. He lost the ensuing rally then shook his head at his player’s box, suggesting that he wasn’t right. Injury suddenly imperiled the most anticipated match of the men’s draw in Melbourne. After having his serve broken, Djokovic was evaluated by a physiotherapist, who took him off court to wrap up his left thigh. A doctor administered a dose of painkillers. Djokovic returned to the court and lost the first set to Alcaraz, who looked unfazed.]]></summary>

In the second week The Artist's Way asks readers to consider the role other people can play in aiding—or stifling—one's creative practices. Well, this is certainly an inconvenient time to be introspective about the wider world intruding into creative work. But this week's readings were a helpful reminder of how much of an effect the people in your life can have.
This week the gang looked into our roadblocks, took trips to the museum and the coffeeshop and encouraged our Sims characters to try to date more. It's all part of the process! (And speaking of process, if you're not sure what's happening here, find out more about why your buddies at Defector are blogging through Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way.)]]></summary>

Unroll the plastic sheeting, queue up Kool & The Gang on the sound system, and prepare yourselves for a party. Over the last week, the Jazz took several large steps toward the accomplishment of their mission for the 2024–25 NBA season. Despite hardships and long odds, the team now controls its own destiny. The finish line is in sight.
The Jazz, after a most unfortunate Jan. 12 victory, found themselves with a record of 10–28, good for only second worst in the Western Conference, and only fifth worst in the NBA. That win, over the Brooklyn Nets, came despite the best efforts of the team's front office, which invented, embellished, and lucked into minimally plausible reasons for de-activating five of their top six scorers, including giving "rest" to 23-year-old center Walker Kessler, the team's best defender and rim protector. The Nets, not to be outdone, sat their four top scorers, and snuck off with the loss in overtime.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jason Kelce retired on March 4, 2024. His long-rumored exit from the NFL came after 13 years at center for the Philadelphia Eagles. He’ll likely make the Pro Football Hall of Fame. As chronicled in the 2023 documentary Kelce, he married Philadelphia native Kylie McDevitt; they still live in the Philadelphia suburbs. Kelce played center, so he was basically anonymous to anyone but hardcore football fans until his rousing speech at the Super Bowl victory parade in 2018. He donned a Mummers costume and listed the many ways people doubted the Eagles. It was pretty great. It earned him a lifetime of admiration in the city and put him on a trajectory for a much bigger profile outside of it.
Kelce has indeed stayed retired from the sport, but he has not gone away. He has become not just the most famous interior lineman in American public life by a wide margin, but a mostly inescapable fixture during NFL broadcasts and a completely inescapable one during the commercial breaks in NFL broadcasts, where he banters with his brother or his mom or the CGI buffalo mascot of Buffalo Wild Wings. He has continued to co-host one of the most popular sports podcasts, New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce, which launched in September of 2022. He contributed to a third Christmas album featuring the Philadelphia offensive line; one song on A Philly Special Christmas Party was a duet with Kelce and Stevie Nicks. He got involved in a match at WrestleMania 40 in Philly. He smashed some asshole’s phone. He and Kylie Kelce were harangued down the shore by a drunk lady. Kylie now has a popular podcast, too.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While we all enjoy the performative outrage of baseball medioids who found provocative insult and/or inexcusable stupidity in the one Hall of Fame vote that Ichiro Suzuki did not get when the results were released Tuesday, we have heard nothing about the unspecified number of voters for the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame who didn't cast a ballot for him when Ichiro was inducted there earlier this week. This leads us to assume if nothing else that Japanese fans don't have America’s unanimity fetish, let alone our propensity to be annoying scolds.
Suzuki was approved to headline the July dog-and-pony extravaganza in Cooperstown by 393 of the 394 participating voters, which meant of course that the hunt was on for the one recalcitrant Hall of Fame voter who either didn't watch baseball for 19 consecutive years, forgot who he was voting for because nobody uses Ichiro’s last name, or was too excited to check off Troy Tulowitzki's name to read the one after C.C. Sabathia. Whatever the reason, that was the main takeaway from Tuesday's announcement—that everyone got a chance to screech about the one person who had disgraced and perhaps ruined baseball forever by not voting for one of the most obviously deserving players of his era.]]></summary>

We've sat through 50 games of them playing mediocre hockey (24th of 32 teams, barely better than the Detroit Red Wings) in a glorified closet and a collective alias and now we might not get Utah Yeti?
Hardly worth the bother of caring any more now, is it? Might as well dress them in mauve and pewter uniforms without names or numbers and call them the Utah Undifferentiated Latter-Day None Of Your Business Blandburgers, if that's what we're going to get.]]></summary>

The next day, the price of a bitcoin exceeded $100,000 for the first time, a clear sign that the fourth cryptocurrency boom was on and that the incoming Trump administration would make good on his campaign promises to loosen the industry's regulatory reigns. The days of federal skepticism and persecution were over. The industry rejoiced. Its planet-killing money laundering apparatus would finally be legitimated.
Amid the broader horrors unveiled over inauguration weekend, Trump also launched a pair of memecoins; by the time the former crypto skeptic was inaugurated a few days later, the fully diluted value of $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens had stabilized near a combined $44 billion. Instead of getting what they wanted on the first day of the Trump presidency, the crypto traditionalist wing got surprised. Many of its members were furious, with Mark Cuban worrying that "people will think memecoins are the foundation of the crypto industry," and Lead Lag Report's Michael Gayed decrying "a general level of disgust" with the launch. "I do believe this puts into question some of Trump's credibility when we have a president-elect enrich himself just before inauguration and make a mockery of an entire ecosystem," Gayed told the Wall Street Journal.]]></summary>

Food trucks parked along the north curb of Independence Avenue Saturday afternoon pumped great-smelling fried stuff to euphoric blonde types in the usual assortment of tacky Trump gear. Big corn-fed-looking college-aged bros clustered at crosswalks, even smirkier and chestier than usual.
The generally delightful cafe in the lobby of the Hirshhorn Museum was clogged with shiny-faced weirdos in American flag sweaters and white and gold caps proclaiming "Donald Trump Was Right About Everything," milling around near a window and waiting for their various lattes. The exhibit one floor down from the lobby was titled Basquiat x Banksy, and featured Jean-Michel Basquiat's gorgeous Boy and Dog in a Johnnypump, over which Banksy had contributed Banksquiat: Boy and Dog in Stop and Search, with his usual thudding anti-subtlety. The exhibit is funded in part by conservative billionaire investor Kenneth C. Griffin, who purchased Boy and Dog in a Johnnypump in 2020 for more than $100 million, the same year that he threatened to move the offices of his hedge fund out of Illinois in protest of a graduated income tax.]]></summary>

My memories of the person I’ve been fuse into a rat king caricature version of myself—someone way too loud, way too presumptuous, with no idea how little she knew. The further back in time I go, the more certain I am that I was a jerk, and hopelessly mired in the miasma of my mental illnesses and ambition, stumbling through delicate interpersonal dynamics with the grace of an elephant. For that reason, I don’t often open my past journals.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The name Kluivert carries a lot of weight in Dutch soccer. Patrick Kluivert is one of the top scorers in the national team's history, and he spearheaded the Oranje attack at the 1994 and 1998 World Cups, where the Netherlands reached the quarterfinals and semifinals, respectively. This is all to say that when Kluivert's son Justin came up through the famed Ajax youth system last decade, people paid attention.
The younger Kluivert might have had the name and the developmental pedigree, debuting at the age of 17 for Ajax's senior side, but he didn't quite have "it" in the same way his father did. The early promise of his Ajax years earned him a €19 million move to Roma in 2018, but his progression soon stalled. A couple unexceptional Serie A seasons were followed by loans to Leipzig, Nice, and Valencia, but the former wunderkind's star looked to have already faded. When he moved to Bournemouth in the summer of 2023, there was surprisingly little noise made about a player once surrounded by so much buzz.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We expect coaches and managers to be megalomaniacs; it is something like a function of the job. We also expect them to be full-on pathological liars, emotional manipulators, self-absorbed bullies, and dictators, and in general people only appreciate them for that once they've been fired. Often because they are fired. It’s complicated. See Nick Sirianni for further elucidation.
So when we say that Manchester United's still new-ish manager Ruben Amorim is seeking out weird new territory, we're saying something. Amorim not only says this is currently coaching the worst Manchester United team ever (which is historically inaccurate), he also says that he is actively hurting the team (which might be part of the design). He is just eleven games into his tenure and is already blowing up the job, himself included.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was a kid, like a lot of kids in the ‘80s, I had a View-Master. I had a few View-Masters, actually. You may have seen them before—they were these little red camera-looking things, with what looked like a visor in the middle and a little orange lever on the side. They were a kind of mini-photo projector. When you bought them, you also got a bunch of little round cards dotted along the edges with slides. The card fit into a slot, and every time you pushed the lever, a new slide would pop up with a new image. It made a satisfying click sound. I remember having an E.T. one, but they also had cards for television shows and toys. Mine were all movies. It wasn’t like watching the film, but it was kind of 3D and it was better than reading a short interview in some teen magazine, which is all you could really get in those days if you were a kid looking for more engagement with your favorite movies (VHS tapes rarely had special features). The images passed by one after the other, as you flipped through, retelling the story in distinct parts. It was full of holes, but it hit important notes, like Gertie kissing E.T. over that flower. Your memory of the movie itself filled in the blanks.
View-Masters first came out in 1939, on the back of high-quality color photos. But they weren’t that different from Eadweard Muybridge’s projected discs of The Horse in Motion from 1878. Considered to be the first bit of proto-cinema, the photographer’s glass discs, dotted with images of a horse in various stages of gallop, were cycled through an early version of the movie projector that he called, for obvious reasons, a zoopraxiscope. The whole thing came less out of artistic aspiration than scientific inquiry—a man just wanted to know what position a horse’s feet actually went through when it moved really fast, which was hard to see with the naked eye. Muybridge captured the motion, but also the parts that made it up; movement through time was important, but the individual images were too.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Connor McDavid is having a quiet season by his standards, which means he's got 65 points in 43 games—ho hum. He's still the scariest person on the ice with the puck on his stick, and if an opponent can take him out of a play at the cost of one of their own, there's not a player alive they wouldn't make that trade for. Unfortunately for McDavid, "superstar calls" in the NHL work the opposite way—less skilled defenders are more or less allowed to harass, pester, and otherwise torment the league's most talented skaters, right up to and slightly past the line of a foul, because officials simply won't call the rulebook to the letter if it'd mean whistling a penalty every seven seconds. It's enough to frustrate anyone into cross-checking Conor Garland in the face.
In the wild closing seconds of Vancouver's 3-2 win over Edmonton on Saturday, Garland took it upon himself to remove McDavid as a threat. Keep an eye on them during the last-minute barrage in the Canucks' end: Garland pulls McDavid to the ice and holds his arm so he can't get up. McDavid throws a punch, gets to his skates—and is promptly wrapped up and dragged down a second time. That was enough for him. After getting to his feet again, he delivered a cross-check to Garland's grill. Can't do that.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ohio State Buckeyes are the national champions of the 2024 college football season, and victors of the inaugural 12-team playoff. The Buckeyes dismantled Notre Dame, 34-23, and despite a valiant effort by the Irish in the second half, the result was never really in much doubt. It was a fitting end to the scorched-earth campaign undertaken by the Buckeyes and head coach Ryan Day who, following an embarrassing 13-10 loss to rival Michigan, went on to blow out Tennessee, then No. 1 seed Oregon, then Texas, and finally Notre Dame. After all that, Ryan Day has finally proven he can win the big one, and the projected $20 million that was spent in NIL money to put together this championship roster ended up being a worthwhile investment.
Ohio State quarterback Will Howard threw for 231 yards on 17-of-21 passing, ran for another 57 yards, and finished with two touchdowns and no interceptions. After executing an 18-play drive to score first, which included nine QB runs by Riley Leonard, the Irish spent the rest of the first half completely shut out. Leonard threw for 255 yards overall and ran for 40. Although Leonard led a decent comeback to get back within eight points in the second half, Ohio State had too much firepower to feel truly threatened.]]></summary>
