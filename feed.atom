Weird policy initiatives were by then a fact of life for workers in the federal government, who blew a couple of weeks immediately following Donald Trump's second inauguration frantically chasing DEI phantoms out of their agencies' contracts and charters, at the expense of operational priorities. Chaos is the new norm.

He looks like he just ordered employees at the NIH to email him “five things that made you hype today.” He looks like someone an NFL player would beat the shit out of after mistaking him for Ben Solak. He looks like he believes the future of global economics lies in Queefcoin. You get the idea.
But Gladstone arrives in Jacksonville with a decent pedigree, including a nine-year stint—did he start work after graduating from middle school?—in the Rams’ front office. The Rams are a good NFL organization. They have their shit together, so it would stand to reason that Gladstone, despite the remarkable amount of Charlottesville energy he gives off, would prove surprisingly eloquent up on the podium. Sean McVay is a young guy too, you know! Not every young is hopeless! Maybe this paperboy is just what the moribund Jaguars have always needed!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I first learned to appreciate warm-ups because of Michigan hoops. The football culture at that school was intense to the point where I had multiple panic attacks in that gigantic stadium, but the basketball arena felt something like home. If you got there early enough, on the one or two times a week that the men's team would play, you could sit right behind the bench, practically on the floor. I liked it so much more than football not only because of the decreased BAC and ambient hysteria but also for the way you could see the athletes as real people—your peers, really—and not just maize and blue gladiators. With the pep band playing familiar tunes—"I Want You Back" and "You Can Call Me Al" and so on—I could get lost in their preparations: the careful stretching-out of recent injuries, the slightly forbidden thrill of attempting a showy dunk or an ultra-long-range shot, the choreography of staff members each with their own small role to play, even if it was just fetching rebounds. It was an almost meditative way to settle in before the emotional stress to come.
I still make a point of arriving early enough to catch warm-ups—especially when I'm watching hockey, where the beauty of the skate-around a half-hour before the advertised start time carries the warmth of a religious ritual. On Tuesday, as the New York Islanders hosted the Winnipeg Jets, I was one of a very few in position to enjoy this routine—the lack of fans symbolic of an uninspiring season. But the empty seats did not portend a desolate night.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re familiar with Jimmy Johnson’s career arc, you know that few people in history have been more openly grateful to no longer be coaching. Johnson said as much publicly ever since leaving the profession back in 1999. My man wanted more time to fish, to hang out in the Florida Keys, and to pretend he enjoys being with his wife and children. So what does a thinking Hall of Famer do when he wants to chill, but also doesn’t mind making a few million per year on the side? You guessed it: He becomes a replacement-level yapper on television, until he doesn’t feel like doing it anymore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the perks of observing LeBron James's 22 NBA seasons is constantly being presented with new, concise ways to sum up the absurdity of that career. Here's one he gave us during last night's 136-115 win over the Pelicans: In a game where James went for 34-8-6 and became the first player in league history to score 50,000 combined postseason and regular-season points, his son played four minutes of garbage time and scored two points.
Give a night like that to any other NBA player navigating the downslope of his career, and it might land like a party. One last game in which the old man summons what remains of his guile and athleticism to remind people that he really used to be like that. Michael Jordan spent the last years of his career sweating out turnaround jumpers in Washington for the sake of chasing nights like these. For LeBron James, who is 40 years old, Tuesday night was just another routine game in what might be the most impressive season of this guy's career.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steve Kerr has visibly aged in his time as an NBA coach, which makes sense given that (a) he will turn 60 during his next training camp, and (b) Thursday's game in Brooklyn will be his 1,000th between regular and postseason, give or take the 55 games he missed but was given credit for while recovering from back surgery. He has also been a general manager for three years in Phoenix under noted loonball Bob Sarver, worked alongside Marv Albert at ESPN, which is to say listened to Marv Albert, nearly took the Knicks job when they were embarking on a seven-year stretch of .315 basketball, voiced himself on an episode of Clone High scouting for something called "Tropical Hospital," and has worked alongside all the versions of Draymond Green for more than a decade. Hell, with all that he should look like Dick Van Dyke sticking his head out of a speeding car window, spaniel-style.
But Kerr has managed all this while seeming like a much younger fellow in spirit, which in the industry is almost as revivifying as casting your get-out-of-jail-free-card lot with Stephen Curry.]]></summary>

I assumed I wasn't old enough to understand it, which at that age is one of the most thrilling feelings in the world.
It was a talk show, featuring actual famous guests, and if I had more laughs at the obvious humor of Zorak (evil mantis; bandleader) and Moltar (somewhat less evil lava man; director), none of it would have worked without the straight man—dimwitted host/former superhero Space Ghost—grounding everything with his signature authoritative idiocy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ten minutes into the first quarter of the Dallas Mavericks' Monday night blowout loss to the Sacramento Kings, Kyrie Irving maneuvered around a Kai Jones screen and into the lane, where he split two help defenders, took a bump, and landed oddly on his left foot. His knee crumpled and he immediately went to the floor, calling for the Mavs' athletic training staff. That unit is as used to this sort of thing as any in the NBA. Irving's insistence on staying in the game to shoot his free throws (he made them both) was initial cause for optimism, but ESPN's Shams Charania reported on Tuesday morning that Irving had torn his ACL. The Mavericks, who were already screwed, are now totally terminal.
The theory of the Luka Doncic-Anthony Davis trade, or at least the most coherent available rationalization, was that the Mavericks were trying to win a championship right now, this year. In L.A., Davis had begun agitating to play alongside a true center (touching; was the Boogie Cousins experiment really so formative?), and he'd finally get his wish in Dallas. The Mavs could play their new do-it-all big man alongside either Daniel Gafford or Dereck Lively II and reliably beat the crap out of opponents while Irving shouldered the majority of the shot-creation burden. One could look around at the rest of the Western Conference and credibly think this formula could win three playoff series, provided P.J. Washington and the newly acquired Caleb Martin could hit their threes.]]></summary>

It's funny how talking about your Sims' lives can feel a bit like when a child is in therapy acting out their complicated emotions with a doll. The Sims themselves have their own sort of agency and desires separate from the player, but you can override them in your power as all-powerful god/player.

Last August, she had joined the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a fish and wildlife biologist working in California and Nevada. "What should have been a stable job had started to become very unstable," she said. After Donald Trump took office, Bourne and her colleagues begun receiving a barrage of concerning emails, memorandums, and instructions—not from their supervisors, or even people who were a part of the Fish and Wildlife leadership, but from representatives of the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM). This obscure federal agency has been tasked with the campaign of mass firings of federal workers led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.
When Bourne saw an OPM email asking for a list of probationary employees at Fish and Wildlife—a status that refers to recently hired employees, or employees recently moved into a new position—she asked her supervisor about it. But Bourne's supervisor had no additional insight; they had both received the email at the same time. "I've been hearing that the goal of the new administration was to make people feel stressed out and just make them feel the chaos," Bourne said. "It definitely worked."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of fear in this country is directly caused by guns. According to the CDC, there were over 48,000 firearm-related deaths in the U.S. in 2022, and the specific way in which a gun can kill you—without warning, painfully, at any age, in basically any place—only multiplies the dread. I grew up inundated with stories of mass murder: Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Sandy Hook. The worst nightmares come when it hits home—when the people shot are from your community (Pulse), your roots (Oxford, Michigan), or a critical part of your everyday life (the NYC subway). But gun violence is no less devastating when it doesn't make national news: a child shot on the street in your neighborhood, a friend's older brother's suicide, domestic violence taken to lethal extremes. The capacity to destroy bestowed by a gun on whoever holds it—a cop, a kid, a hunter—is a power that should be regarded with horror.
Over the past several months, another fear has increased in prevalence among trans people in particular: the fear of a government that is not just ignorant or apathetic about our existence but is actively working to eradicate us from public life. It is the position of the Trump administration that trans people do not exist, and therefore do not have rights. Confronted with the inconvenient fact of our ongoing lives, the President, Elon Musk, and their cronies are fighting to block our access to healthcare, fire us from our jobs, threaten our safety, and limit our ability to leave the country.]]></summary>

Because in the heat of battle during the ninth round of a shockingly fabulous and dramatic WBA lightweight title fight Saturday night, against underdog challenger Lamont Roach in Brooklyn, Davis did just that. And he got away with it. Then again, this fight was full of the unexpected, not least of which was the majority draw the judges gave the fight after 12 fascinating rounds. The Barclays Center crowd, which was very pro-Davis at the beginning of the night, booed loudly when the decision was announced, knowing the champ had been saved by the referee and feeling Roach was robbed on the scorecards.]]></summary>

Should Democrats attend Donald Trump's address to the joint session of Congress Tuesday night? The party can't decide what to do. Some Democratic senators and representatives want to boycott the event, to deny Trump's frenetic and lawless program of misrule any of the ceremonial trappings of the presidency. Others want to show up and participate as a rebuke to Trump—including the party's leaders in both chambers, Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, who, Axios wrote, "want members to attend and bring special guests who have been negatively affected by the administration."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might feel somewhat discordant, given that JD Vance's most prominent physical feature is a golf-ball head that makes his body look like a tee, but the administration he's part of is one that understands the value of performance. How else are you supposed to read Vance aligning himself with a broccoli-cut racist and against his own children? Or Vance joining Marco Rubio and Donald Trump to stage an ambush on Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy this past Friday? That they invited him to the Oval Office to call him an ungrateful broke boy is itself pretty nasty and evil, though the most striking aspect of the airing of grievances was its staging. It was less a forum for diplomacy and more a show for the public, captured by several cameras and conducted in front of a jeering press corps. The point was not just to humiliate a soon-to-be former ally, but to be seen humiliating him by a public who is being told that this counts as action.
That sort of geopolitical kabuki feels maddening and somewhat abstract, and while the nature of Vance's arrangement with political power and capital is such that he is largely insulated from consequences, the good news is that Vance still can be told to fuck off when he deigns to be among the people. That is not the same as meaningfully fucking off, but it must have felt so good to be among the gathered Vermonters who protested Vance's planned ski getaway this past weekend. Vance and his family went up to Sugarbush Resort in Vermont's Mad River Valley—if you ever find yourself there, check out Canteen Creemee—and instead of the peaceful vacation they imagined for themselves, they got screamed at. Around 1,000 people lined the streets of Waitsfield, and several people skiing alongside Vance on the mountain brought signs and yelled at him when they got the chance. Enough people were annoying or troublesome enough that the Vance family moved their planned stay from a resort to a private residence and eventually cut short their planned four-day trip.]]></summary>

A combination of theater-kid pageantry overload and an earnest celebration of Hollywood, or maybe just of the people working in Hollywood. The show has never had its finger on the pulse of the art form, settling instead on keeping its foot on the sternum, and the movies that lose usually say more about the state of the medium than the movies that win.
This year's slate of nominees featured very few truly great movies, but also very few truly bad ones. So a lukewarm Oscars telecast is exactly what everyone should've expected. A few laughs, a couple surprises, and no one walks away feeling particularly good or bad about any of it in totality. Good work!]]></summary>

For what, we're not sure, and with jurisdiction he does not have, he has decided that Rose needs to be reintegrated into America's good graces in the way Rose expressly said he didn't want it: posthumously.
But as the master of the grand and clumsy gesture, the Snickers-bar-in-chief said he was going to pardon him anyway, claiming with syntactical shoes-on-the-wrong-feet grace that Rose "never betted against himself, or the other team. He had the most hits, by far, in baseball history, and won more games than anyone in history." How Rose's betting slips or his Baseball Reference page covers his conviction for tax evasion is hard to parse, as is the claim that he "never betted against himself or the other team" unless he was trying to middle every bet he ever made by betting both ways.]]></summary>

That is the reason you are getting a themeless puzzle this week and did not get one last week to end the month as you normally do!

Trent has been constructing crossword puzzles since 2018. His work has appeared in the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Wall Street Journal, and other major publications and independent puzzle venues. He publishes free puzzles at gridtherapy.com.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three years ago, Deebo Samuel changed the nature of offensive football. This weekend, he was traded from San Francisco to Washington for a fifth-round draft choice, not long after his 29th birthday. In the NFL, life comes at you fast and aims for your legs with a pipe wrench.
Samuel was the signature piece at the zenith of the Kyle Shanahan Experience, the 49ers' ringless dynasty that looks like it might be ninja-stalking its sell-by date. He was the intriguing pass-catcher who became significantly more when he was unleashed as a running threat from the wideout position midway through the 2021 season. They solved their average-but-not-much-more-than-that quarterbacking problem, code-named Jimmy Garoppolo, by doubling down on an already run-dependent offense (they won the NFC championship game two years earlier by deliberately throwing only eight passes) with Samuel breaking down defenses by attacking with verve and sparkle from the outside back toward the maelstrom of the tackle box. He was named All-Pro, and teams across the league started thinking about wide receivers as running backs waiting for their moment.]]></summary>

The benefit of football is that sometimes they are pushing each other's tushes. The benefits of soccer and basketball are currently unknown to me, but I am willing to learn. But of all the sports, it is hockey which rewards the ass appreciator the most.
Hockey players are known to be unbelievably jacked in their lower body. Their quads are huge! Their hamstrings are made of steel! Their calves are as big as my thigh! The effort of pushing yourself around on skates for your entire life is a perfect formula for building a beautiful, ginormous butt. One of my favorite hockey articles of all time is an ESPN The Magazine story where Emily Kaplan interviewed a bunch of NHL players about how hard it is for them to buy jeans. Which is why I was stunned, horrified even, to see my king the menswear critic Derek Guy calling this butt a "prominent seat."]]></summary>

But the reason this is notable is because the jersey in question was at the center of a bit of fan theater that went viral and subsequently boomeranged faster than anyone could have guessed. No sooner had Wembenyama swapped jerseys with a kid—Comme c'est merveilleux!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In January, Emma Hayes called in 50 players to train with the USWNT. Twenty-six were with the senior national team, and the rest were part of a Futures camp, which was meant to develop and scout young prospects. It was all part of Hayes’s mission to revamp the American women’s soccer system at all levels. Since then, she’s laid out a far-reaching plan that details how she hopes to push the American soccer world to reframe its goals from matching the men’s game to doing instead whatever is best for female players specifically. The effects of that blueprint, or “The WNT Way” as she calls it, will only be evident years down the line. But where Hayes does have total control, and where results are more prompt, is with the senior national team. Most immediately, she would have to select a 23-player roster for the SheBelieves Cup.
U.S. Soccer created the poorly named tournament in 2016 as an alternative to the Algarve Cup. It’s not a tournament that means much on its face, other than being a guaranteed three games against strong opposition at a regular lull in the international soccer calendar. With more than two years to go before the next major tournament, this SheBelieves Cup provided a good opportunity for the USWNT to tinker with its roster and tactics.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Magic are a fun, flawed team. Evidence of both attributes could be seen on Thursday night, when, after leading by 17 at one point in a game against Golden State, Orlando looked poised for a statement win against a surging Warriors squad. But God had other plans, and by God I mean the 6-foot-2 demon with No. 30 on his chest who goes by the name Steph Curry.
Curry scored a personal season-high 56 points on 16-of-25 shooting, 12 of those makes coming from three-point range. He hit one shot from well behind the half-court line shot to end the first half, and scored 22 points in the third quarter alone, outscoring the entire Magic team in that period. Whether it's invigoration from the arrival of Jimmy Butler (the Warriors have won seven of their last eight), or if he just had the juice flowing last night, Curry put on a prime performance, the likes of which we haven't often seen from him this year. The Warriors needed every bit of it to overcome Butler's off night and the aforementioned double-digit deficit.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Emilia Perez star Karla Sofía Gascón’s racist tweets, and blackface allegations related to I’m Still Here lead actress Fernanda Torres have been grabbing headlines, the more overlooked 2025 Oscars scandal continues to be egregious nomination snubs for Black-led performances. The most notable omissions were Marianne Jean-Baptiste for Mike Leigh’s Hard Truths, Danielle Deadwyler for Malcolm Washington’s The Piano Lesson, Clarence Maclin for Greg Kwedar’s Sing Sing, and Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor for RaMell Ross’s Nickel Boys. And while Nickel Boys did receive Best Picture and Adapted Screenplay nominations, the most baffling Oscar oversights were in the technical categories: Jomo Fray for Nickel Boys' cinematography and RaMell Ross for directing and film editing. Nickel Boys is a masterpiece, and it’s here where the film is the most experimental, inventive, and alive to the possibilities of cinema. 
Ross's 2018 debut feature, the unconventional, Oscar-nominated documentary, Hale County This Morning, This Evening, follows the life of two Black high school students from Hale County, Ala., where the documentarian and visual artist spent five years immersed in the rural Black communities as a photography teacher, capturing footage. The film bends time and linearity to craft a communal tapestry of the banality and nuance of life in the Black Belt region, as well as early Black cinema (e.g., Lime Kiln Club Field Day). Ultimately, what emerges is what Ross names his “source code” for the recordkeeping of Black southern life liberated from the dominant ways of seeing. Ross’s second feature builds upon the “empowered black data” laid forth in the contemporary through Hale County to attend to the forgotten Black boys of the Jim Crow South and its afterlives.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a presidential administration with an unlimited capacity for chaos, colleges and universities have become targets of this early phase of right-wing assault. This is not so surprising: Many of the key political threads that comprise today’s Trumpism share an opposition to the academy and all it represents. Chris Rufo has presided over the dismantling of New College of Florida and succeeded in smuggling his bespoke interpretations of concepts like “DEI” and “critical race theory” into state law and now federal policy. JD Vance has appeared at gatherings of national conservatives to say that “professors are the enemy.”
Trump’s newest allies in Silicon Valley may worship a narrow idea of intelligence, but they view the long apprenticeship, not to mention the still-broad education required of the traditional college student, as a waste of time. And then there is Trump’s traditional base, which splits decisively along educational lines: educational attainment now reliably predicts support for the Democratic Party. Trump, for his part, has said that he loves “the poorly educated”—and they love him back! From another quarter, the battle is joined by MAHA types, COVID skeptics, and Big Pharma truthers who see the country’s medical research apparatus as a machine for laundering money into dubiously valuable experiments that make Americans sicker and the pharmaceutical companies that sell medical remedies richer. What Americans really need, in their view, is raw milk, beef tallow, and a few weeks on the happy farm.]]></summary>

That gap, for better and worse, is also where the terror of it resides.

This was what I worried about when we had on Nathan Grayson, our old GMG coworker, Aftermath co-founder, and author of the new book Stream Big: The Triumphs and Turmoils of Twitch and the Stars Behind the Screen to talk about that embattled, huge-but-not-profitable streaming platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a team that scores goals by the bucketful, it's interesting that Barcelona's game is designed first and foremost around the pass. It's not that the squad doesn't have finishers: Old Man Robert Lewandowski remains a (silver) fox in the box; Ferran Torres, Fermín López, and Dani Olmo all, as they say, have goals in them; and, by some sort of arcane ethno-numerological magic, Barça's current Brazilian No. 11, Raphinha, has this year transformed into Barça's former Brazilian No. 11, Rivaldo. But the three players who form Barça's foundation in this unexpectedly amazing season are Pau Cubarsí, Lamine Yamal, and Pedri. And each of them individually, and therefore the team collectively, is defined by their genius for passing.
Lamine's passing is naturally the showiest. Of all the skills that make up the teenager's world-class present and his limitless future potential, it's his gift for the final ball that stands out as the most differential today. At just 17 years old he already has a trademark move, the trivela pass, one of the most difficult and visually arresting techniques in the game. Cubarsí's passing is maybe the most readily identifiable. There are passes he hits—be they bombs over the top of the opposition back line, jackknifed balls that cut through tiny crevices to find teammates between enemy lines, or disguised ones that his body shapes toward one direction until at the last second he swivels his action-figure hips and sends them off at a completely different angle—that look more like what a Pirlo-style midfielder might try than a central defender. There's genuinely no other center back right now who's executing complicated passes like Cubarsí, who is himself only 18 years old. But while those two certainly play a major role in forming the team's style, the true orchestrator of all the pretty little passes that bypass pressure, unbuckle defenses, and tee up Lewandowski and Raphinha and the rest for the goals that have made Barça one of the two standout teams in Europe this season, is Pedri.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers of young adult fiction, who have long been drawn to stories that combine relatable characters and fantastical elements (think Twilight or The Hunger Games), have been aging into new reading levels and more adult content. Enter Romantasy, which combines romance and fantasy elements. It is currently one of the fastest growing publishing genres and a “massive focus” for TikTok fandoms. No small part of the popularity of Romantasy is owing to the fact that the genre has associations beyond its mix of romance plots with otherworldly imaginative settings and characters. These associations are … sexual. Romantasy usually has what fans call “spice.” Readers can expect detailed, extended, and—naturally—extraordinary sex scenes. Extraordinary how, exactly?
A remarkable range of popular contemporary romantasy series feature relationships between human women and non-human males, from dragons to mermen. There is Sarah J. Maas’s A Court of Thorns and Roses and its sequels, in which women commingle with immortal faeries; Carissa Broadbent’s The Serpent and the Wings of Night, featuring a female protagonist who is the only human daughter of a vampire king, or Tentacle Entanglement, a “monster mates” book by “Siggy Shade,” the title of which tells you what you need to know. Often these relationships involve “fated mates,” with the males unable to escape an exorable drive to love the women with the utmost passionate devotion. All of these are huge on BookTok. What is the appeal of these novels, and why do they seem to be proliferating now?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love when a team has distinct flaws but isn't irredeemable. It's one of my favorite things in sports, actually—that extended fight to minimize weaknesses and maximize strengths in a journey from "slightly below average" to "slightly above average." I don't want a perfect protagonist. The work that goes into moderate improvement is what satisfies me. For that reason, we turn our attention to the Emma Woodhouses of the NHL.
After the extended 4 Nations break, it's a bit of a jolt to realize that so many teams are suddenly back to high-stakes action on a schedule that feels pretty scrunched. Out in the West, six playoff spots read as extremely secure, while the remaining two look like a battle among Colorado, Calgary, and Vancouver, with perhaps Utah as a dark horse. I want to focus on the East, however, because that's where the drama already has me biting my nails. Six teams are reasonably comfortable, but below them, we've got five squads auditioning for the two wild card roles. Three of these teams would see a playoff berth as a relieving breakthrough after a long struggle; the other two would be severely disappointed in themselves if they let this year go to waste. Here is a quick guide to them all, starting with seventh place and working our way down.]]></summary>

I have touristed my way around many cities with my wife and children in tow, which meant negotiating air travel, hotel reservations, restaurant reservations, museum reservations, shopping excursions, and every other tourist chore with their needs in mind. Truly exhausting shit. This explains why I’m the sort of person who treats business travel as a meditative experience. When I’m off the clock in any new city, I take full advantage. I go where I want. I see what I want. And, most vital, I eat what I want.
Which brings us to Pittsburgh. I was in the Steel City for my first time, on a super top secret assignment for Defector Media. I was told by people I trusted that, despite the presence of multiple Steelers fans, Pittsburgh is a surprisingly cool place to hang. They were right. The city’s downtown is alive. The Pirates ballpark is so perfectly situated along the banks of the Allegheny River that the home team doesn’t even have to win to give you your money’s worth (and it doesn’t). And the Andy Warhol Museum contains some of the most arresting works of art I’ve ever had the pleasure of beholding. One of my favorite pieces inside of it was the one that Warhol and his friends pissed on.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my brightest childhood memories was experiencing the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone for the first time. My mom spent a few summers working in a cafeteria at Mammoth Hot Springs by the north entrance, so she knew the park well enough to have me and my brother look down at our feet through the short hike to the observation platform. She knew that the experience of all that empty air and angry water was one worth having as suddenly and forcefully as possible. I remember distinctly how small it made me feel, how awestruck I was that it was merely a grand canyon, not even one to merit the definite article. It is important to feel small, overjoyed, or fascinated by the outdoors, and to learn about the world and one's place in it through those feelings.
Eight decades into the gradual privatization of once-public postwar spoils, and despite climate change frenzying the competition for land, more than a third of the land in the United States is administered by federal agencies, mostly the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service. The vast majority of this land is west of the Rockies, in areas of low population density on the old American frontier. That includes almost two-thirds of Nevada (and my namesake I-80 exit); the second-largest desert preserve in the world; and the highest and lowest points in the continental United States, which are separated by less than 100 miles' worth of one of the most beautiful regions of California. These lands are the only parts of the country that both are for everyone and whose chief utility is, well, nothing. You can camp for 14 nights without a permit on most BLM land. There are economies built around them—tourism and all manner of gear companies—though the land itself is only faintly capitalized by private industry. Logging companies do harvest a bit of timber from Forest Service land, and there's some agriculture, but only enough to underscore how much of it is just kind of sitting there. That is to say: Most of the land is administered as if it's useless.]]></summary>

The phrase sounded alienating, like the impossible promise of some doomed startup or the way Meta might refer to the advent of tongues. But these words appeared, in this order, in a report recently published in the journal Current Biology titled "Innovative flavoring behavior in Goffin’s cockatoos," which only made me feel intrigued. A cockatoo innovation, you say? Regarding flavoring? Tell me more!
As I read the abstract, I realized that the key innovation of this new paper was innovated by nine cockatoos, all of whom had learned to drag a noodle through a puddle of blueberry-flavored soy yogurt. The innovation, the researchers contend, is not the daring idea of creamy blueberry noodles—although this seemed the most radical recipe I'd encountered in years—but rather the flavoring behavior itself, which is rare in the animal kingdom.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Los Angeles Lakers eked out a win Tuesday night over the visiting Dallas Mavericks, 107–99. The win keeps the rising Lakers a scant few percentage points up on the Houston Rockets for the West's fourth seed; the loss leaves Dallas perilously close to the bottom of the conference play-in. Neither team will have to scrounge around too desperately for encouragement: The Lakers played choppy, underwhelming basketball, but got the hero stuff they needed from their best guys and eventually took care of business; the Mavericks looked sharper and better organized but were handicapped by injuries and doomed by an off-shooting night. In basketball terms, this was not a memorable game, just one of those February work-nights where no one has it going but someone has to win.
Because it was the first contest between these two teams since the Luka Doncic trade, assessing it solely in basketball terms misses quite a lot of context. "It was just a lot of emotions and not much sleep," said a wrung-out and relieved Doncic, who had an off night despite posting a triple-double. "It was a different game ... I'm just glad it's over, honestly." Tension was high, at least in the early going: Doncic picked up a technical foul in the game's third minute for objecting to a swallowed whistle. Later in the quarter, when he bombed home a deep three-pointer and turned to glare at Dallas's bench, television cameras picked up several of his former teammates grinning and laughing in what appeared to be sincere appreciation. They're bigger men—literally and figuratively—than I: Being mean-mugged by a former colleague for an unpopular decision made by management would cause me to boil with indignation; if Tom Ley trades Luis Paez-Pumar to Wired, Luis had better direct his vengeful showboating at Tom damn Ley, or summon a competent second and face me in a duel at sunrise! I will have satisfaction, by God.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When researchers look at what effects astronauts could face on long-term missions, exploring Mars or beyond, one thing they tend to focus on something called the "third-quarter" effect. It's a sports-y sounding name for something we all might be familiar with, that feeling when morale tends to hit a low point in the third quarter of long missions. It makes sense that the middle is always the roughest time. The beginning and end benefit from excitement, either from just beginning or from being almost done. Right in the middle of a process is usually where morale sags the most, so if you can get through that period, things will almost certainly start to feel better. 
We are smack dab in the middle of the third quarter of The Artist's Way, and morale is sagging, predictably. Luckily we are not astronauts and can blog from right here on Earth. If you're following along with us, maybe you're feeling the drag too. The good news is that the fourth quarter is in sight.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Oklahoma City Thunder just split two games in two days against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was incredible in both, notching 76 total points, 18 rebounds, and 16 assists. If you wanted to understand what makes SGA so good and cool, Sunday night's 130-123 gem was the ideal one-game sample; if you want to understand why he matters so much and why the largely untouchable Thunder still face so many big questions, Monday night's horrific loss was equally instructive.
So much of what makes the Thunder special is collective: their heat-seeking defense, unmatchable depth, team-wide shooting. As team setups go, having a dozen players who can defend as if armed and who generally play basketball at what appears to be 1.25x speed is certainly more unusual and interesting than surrounding one or two superstars with a roster purpose-built to their talents. The Thunder's formula does, however, rely on a number of stylistic hallmarks that tend to be marginalized by the differences between regular and postseason hoops. Can they still force turnovers on like every third possession in the playoffs? Will their depth really matter when they have to play against opposing rotations stripped of all their weak players?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his own words, Pankaj Mishra wrote his latest book not to describe the atrocities in Gaza, which have been well documented, but "to ask some very basic questions: How can human beings treat other human beings this way? And to also ask people today, or readers today: How can we allow this to happen? How could we allow something like Gaza to happen?"
The World After Gaza, based off Mishra's 2024 essay for the London Review of Books, uses the historical context following World War II to deliver a meaningful reminder: The West did not welcome Holocaust survivors with open arms. In fact, the global powers treated them as a nuisance and looked to relocate them elsewhere. The current-day narrative, that the West immediately recognized the Holocaust was an atrocity, is a comforting fiction. As is, Mishra argues, the idea that the international standard of laws and norms set in 1945 can remain legitimate after having been abandoned in service to Israeli objectives.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2016, when Donald Trump was elected president the first time, people felt scared but also called to action. Protests began instantly, starting literally the day after the election. People were hyper aware of Trump's attempts to lie to the public, were vigilant about his racist, xenophobic, homophobic, and sexist policies, and were vocal in their opposition throughout his term in office. Within that storm of dissent, rap music echoed its revolutionary past by sounding off against Trump. Artists like Snoop Dogg and Jay-Z voiced their anger. Acts like A Tribe Called Quest and YG wrote protest songs. Any given verse of the era was likely to include at least one stray line aimed at the president; my personal favorite was Young Thug's "I'll slap the shit out Donald Trump any day" on Swae Lee's "Offshore."
This seemed to genuinely bother Trump. Trump had long been a folk hero for rappers, as rappers have a tendency to be our most vocal champions of ruthless capitalism. Trump's combination of wealth, outsized bravado, attention-hungry charisma, and over-the-top egomania put him on similar terms with Ric Flair and Tony Montana, two characters who are also exalted in rap songs. Plenty of rappers never bought into his persona certainly, but he was a source of inspiration for many, as proven by how often he was name-checked. Rappers turning on him had to feel like a betrayal to a creature as vain as Trump.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PITTSBURGH — I've known the names of hockey players for as long as I've known my own. I was lucky enough to be born in Michigan in 1995, just before the Red Wings restored their old glory with back-to-back Stanley Cup wins, and the state's enthusiasm for that team implanted in me a love for the sport that's inextricable from my sense of self. There's video evidence to prove this—me sitting on the floor, lording over a rink symbolized by an oval-shaped train track, using blocks as players while I played PA announcer for an imaginary game at Joe Louis Arena. When I was a few years older, I remember making use of a big, bench-like windowsill at the front of our house, orchestrating games with action figures of guys like Brendan Shanahan, Sergei Fedorov, Paul Kariya, and Peter Forsberg. In the basement, I'd watch VHS recaps of the Wings' '98 Cup triumph, or a compilation of interviews and player profiles for stars like Chris Chelios and Pavel Bure.
What all those players had in common, from my perspective, was that they were established greats, and my knowledge had to catch up to their careers. But that all changed in 2005, when a pair of heavily hyped young prospects each made their debut in the aftermath of a season-cancelling lockout. Alex Ovechkin, first overall in 2004, and Sidney Crosby, picked No. 1 in 2005, were the future. They were the first NHLers I was conscious of knowing before they were actually in the NHL. And as their careers inch closer to the finish line, and I creep closer to my 30th birthday, I'm extra aware of the conduit that these two provide to the person I was two decades ago. I watched them excel then as I do now, but on Saturday, I saw them both play live for the very first time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 26 matchdays, the Premier League goalscoring leaderboard looks quite familiar. At the top is Mohamed Salah, Liverpool's star winger who is in the midst of what could wind up being the best attacking season in league history, with 25 goals and 16 assists while still in February. Next comes Erling Haaland, who has been able to notch 19 goals despite some injury trouble and Manchester City's whole deal. But third is a bit of a surprise, if only because Newcastle United's Alexander Isak has put it all together to become (depending on how one feels about Haaland) arguably the best striker in the Premier League.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twice already this regular season the website Defector has posted blogs about how the horrid and miserable Philadelphia 76ers might be stabilizing and revving up for a charge up the standings. Ridiculous, foolish, irresponsible blog behavior. No more of this! The 76ers are cooked. A last-second bucket Saturday by Nic Claxton of the aimless Brooklyn Nets sent Philly to its seventh consecutive loss and ninth in 10 games, dropping them to a season-worst 16 games below .500. They now hold the 12th seed in the Eastern Conference, one game in the loss column out of the bottom of the play-in and a whopping 10.5 games from the sixth seed. Do not stop with a single fork: Empty your silverware drawer into a cannon, aim the cannon at their cowering forms, and fire away. It would be a mercy.
It is possible to drop a game to a bad team without necessarily being a very bad team yourself. The 76ers are very bad. Their core was in place Saturday and was roundly outplayed by the various fungible goobers presently filling out Brooklyn's rotation. Tyrese Maxey was his usual heroic self, but Paul George was in Tobias Harris mode, and Joel Embiid was history's saddest statue. Brooklyn led most of the way, and very comfortably through the middle quarters, until a spell of sloppy offense and a Philly rebounding edge allowed the otherwise punchless 76ers back into the game late. Notably, Embiid touched the court not at all in the fourth quarter, which head coach Nick Nurse chalked up unconvincingly to the chemistry of the lineup on the floor. To their credit, the 76ers played with spirit down the stretch, but they needed a pair of missed freebies to stay within a bucket, and the game-winner came on an embarrassingly anticlimactic put-back of what should've been an easy defensive rebound for George.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PITTSBURGH — I was a little surprised by the seriousness of The Andy Warhol Museum. For an artist I associate with playful experimentation, the seven-story building off the northwest bank of the Allegheny is more a tribute to the professionalism, work ethic, and marketing acumen that made Warhol the most recognizable artist of his era—or any that's come since. The layout is tightly chronological, with the four main floors each representing a decade in its patron saint's career. The information presented is devoid of tabloid gossip, keeping Warhol's international fame completely incidental to the narrative of his artistic output. And the only time I laughed out loud was at these deadpan info boxes next to Oxidation, which never break character even as they describe the process of creation through urination, and note ongoing study of the piss painting with a straight-faced "Conservation Challenge."]]></summary>

Bivol got a majority decision over the previously undefeated Beterbiev after 12 rounds of near-perfect punches from both on Saturday in Riyadh to capture the undisputed light heavyweight championship, meaning Bivol now has all the 175 lbs. belts that matter: WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO and The Ring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coaches and managers have a tenuous relationship with the veracity of the spoken word, which is to say that when they speak in public, they are generally either lying or setting up their next lie. Frankness rarely serves them well in any context, which is why they avoid it like a pair of anthrax-infused burlap compression shorts. Everything is a message meant for someone else—to confound or mislead opponents, to placate a dungheaded boss, to motivate a slothful player—and the public exists mostly as a conduit through which that message can find its intended target.
And then there's Ruben Amorim, currently having his pants filled daily with red ants as the coach at Manchester United. He finds his inherited team perpetually irksome and clearly cannot wait for the offseason when he can remake it in his tactical image and likeness. This is not speculation, to be clear. It was obvious from the middle of January, when Amorim said this might be the worst Manchester United team of all time. I mean, that's prime talk show stuff right there, and until United either get better or fire him, it will have a resonance that rivals Bill Parcells' "You are what your record says you are," or Jim Mora's "Playoffs? Playoffs?"]]></summary>
