        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back when the conservative activist James O'Keefe first made his mark in the deceptively edited hidden-camera sting video business 15 years ago, he probably did not envision spending his early forties masterminding an operation that would lead to the firing of a mid-level Washington Commanders employee for some out-of-pocket things he said on a pair of secretly recorded dates. O'Keefe, one of the more baroquely damaged defectives in reactionary media, is destroying less notable lives now than he did during the years when the videos he produced led to the resignations of NPR executives and the collapse of the activist organization ACORN, but his rancid body of work is compelling proof that the destruction is something like its own reward for him.
O'Keefe's taste in enemies has never been especially creative, which reflects both what vintage of conservative he is—vain, pretentious, and relentlessly aggrieved, with strong notes of metro-NYC suburbia psychosis on the finish—and the business that he's in. Project Veritas, which O'Keefe built by crafting videos that exposed various conservative culture-war enemies in ways built to fit their laziest media caricatures, was a nonprofit business supported by rich conservatives, and so generally aimed to scratch the recurring itches of those old, dull, nasty people. Sometimes, as with ACORN, O'Keefe got the results he sought. Mostly, he succeeded in helping people whose politics revolve around being scandalized and upset remain in their desired state of agitation, and in raising money from them to help with his many lawsuits.]]></summary>

Each bottle contained a hefty sardine bathed in vegetable oil, and the carousel was programmed to release one sardine every two weeks to attract the deep-sea fish skulking in the area. The muddy bottom served as stomping grounds for sleek sablefish, noodly eelpouts and hagfish, and flabby snailfish, all of whom roam in nearly absolute darkness, aside from glimmers of bioluminescence.
At more than 2,000 feet deep, the observatory one of many deep-sea observatories set up by Ocean Networks Canada, all capturing real-time data of creatures living in the area. The researchers wanted to learn if the fish in the canyon behaved differently around bait in the presence of artificial lights. "Some are attracted, and some avoid it," Héloïse Frouin-Mouy, a marine biologist and bio-acoustician specializing in marine mammals at the University of Miami, wrote in an email. The observatory had both video and acoustic cameras to monitor the behavior of fish with the lights on and off.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In general, it is pretty difficult to get me to feel nostalgic for things that happened after I graduated college. My 20s, for all their excitement and over-the-topness, are one big blur of noise, brunch, and credit card debt. But there is just the tiniest section of my heart, a roped off VIP section, where I feel the pangs of youth pull at me. And more often then not, it is triggered whenever I revisit what I believe to be the best rap project of the 2010s.

Just write 50,000 words over the course of 30 days—a rate of roughly 1,700 words a day. Anyone age 13 or older can take part, which is perhaps why my first introduction to what its adherents call NaNoWriMo came through Tumblr, where every November 1 seemingly half of my dashboard disappeared overnight.  
For 30 days and 30 nights, my mutuals tinkered away at their novels (and then snuck back onto Tumblr to complain about how hard that tinkering was). They asked me to yell at them if I saw them posting. And then, one by one, they gave up their novels and returned to replenishing my feeds with One Direction GIFs and essays on colonialism in the Avatar: The Last Airbender universe. Over time I got the impression that NaNoWriMo was more of a community-building enterprise than a pure literary one. I was never tempted to take part myself. Mostly out of laziness, but I was also never quite convinced that any novel I wrote in a month could be very good. And I had trouble swallowing the concept of participating in something as heinously named as NaNoWriMo.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m not sure Adam Sandler is capable of doing a bad set. Four decades into his career, I think he might be too much of a pro. Asking him to do stand-up badly would be like asking a master carpenter to make a chair badly. The work, after all those years, comes so naturally that doing it wrong would actually be harder. In his new stand-up special, Adam Sandler: Love You, it’s there in the title, that kind of glib “of course” quality—the dismissive way you say “love you” to a parent is the way you say it to Adam Sandler. Like, come on, of course.
At a breezy one hour and 14 minutes, Love You is directed by Josh Safdie, the same guy who co-directed Sandler in Uncut Gems, and it opens with the same blue-lit, rain-drenched noir grit Safdie’s so good at coughing up, though perhaps this one rides less on frenetic anxiety than bustle. Nicolette Larson croons her 1978 hit “Lotta Love,” as Sandler, in full beard and sweats, appears behind a cracked windshield, driving up to an alley full of autograph seekers and entering a dive of a venue crowded with people with too many demands and too little time to have them honored (you might recognize a few of the non-actors Safdie used in Gems here). Various elements of the stage are falling apart, the monitors don’t work, and a dog shows up at one point—it’s a mess. It’s a cute contradictory conceit, the image of a journeyman comedian who is still willing to play a shithole (“Who booked this place?”) for the love of it, reminiscent of Sandler’s lifelong swindler in Gems. Except this is also one of the most famous comedians in the world worth many multiple millions—he’s signing Happy Gilmore jerseys backstage in this, his second Netflix special—no one would dare give this guy the wrong sweetener unless it was scripted.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Isaiah Likely's toe-and-a-shade-more, in and of itself and ever so slightly over the line at the back of the end zone, does not have the same historical import of, say, Kevin Durant's in the 2021 Eastern Conference semifinals. The Baltimore Ravens have 16 more games to prove their worth while those Brooklyn Nets went right to powersuck in a heartbeat, and by extension the Ravens could still affirm Lamar Jackson's place somewhere near the top of the universe. Observing the NFL has been reduced by its simpleton punditocracy to quarterbacks plus some other stuff, because the game itself is apparently too involved to make us think about more than just the one position. Every now and then, though, a big tight end’s big toe can be momentarily significant.
The NFL’s rolling Chief Show was not what the audience wanted from Thursday night's season opener. It wanted Likely to have both feet fully inside the white paint so that the compelling game everyone received could go on a little bit longer. Probably not that much longer—even in that universe where Likely, the Ravens' Kelce-in-training, gets credit for the touchdown he surely had scored, the Ravens probably push it all in on a two-point conversion try that either wins or loses the game. That would have been an act of starkest clarity that made people think more fondly of Ravens head coach John Harbaugh, but it is also academic. The good news was that last night’s game was so compelling that we would have signed up for 10 more minutes of it. The bad news was that it ended in anticlimax. Likely's toe was a quarter-inch too prominent and so a spectacular denouement shriveled to referee Shaun Hochuli declaring that Likely's heroics weren't heroics at all, and that everyone would have to clear the stadium and their living rooms. It was that rare case where virtually all of America’s unaffiliated millions of viewers would have preferred the incorrect call.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thursday, ESPN announced that it will expand its coverage of the National Women's Soccer League and the Premier Lacrosse League, a move meant to "enhance coverage of underserved sports." While nothing a company like ESPN does is purely driven by altruistic motives, this is an overdue course correction from the most influential entity in sports journalism. Hiring more journalists to cover women's soccer and men's lacrosse is a big win for the sports and for readers, and ESPN should reap the benefits of increased reporting by—oh no oh god it's yet another bullshit AI pivot.
Read that quote in the first paragraph again: ESPN wants to "enhance coverage of underserved sports," but is not going to pay real human beings to do this. Instead, it will "leverage Microsoft AI technology" to autogenerate game recaps. But don't worry, a human editor will be on hand to check each recap for "quality and accuracy," because at least the brass at ESPN knows the slop AI is best known for producing. As an example: In the original tweet from ESPN Front Row, the AI-generated recap meant to showcase the feature got the Washington Spirit's record wrong. The company deleted the tweet and reposted it with a different blurb.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The concrete crypt that is baseball in Oakland still offers some appeal, although the experience is most likely to charm someone who is either too true a believer to know better or who had never previously experienced the magic of the Coliseum's Kremlin-style architecture. Thus the news that our much beloved Comrade Anantharaman was making her first trip to what the locals used to call "the Mausoleum" inspired us to try and capture the moments of discovery that would flood her senses, and maybe also show her the toe to which the game has tied its coroner's tag.
Fortunately for her, Comrade Redford was part of the traveling party as well, which left two people who see the good in others and their surroundings to steel themselves against the scheduled indignities of Mariners-A's on a Wednesday night in September when the Mariners are barely in the wild card race and the A's are already sewing "West Sacramento" on their baseball underpants. The comrades would have fun if they had to dig beneath the asphalt to find it; Comrade Anantharaman wanted to experience Oakland baseball as part of what is apparently a very long baseball bucket list, and Comrade Redford just has a good attitude in general.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost exactly two years after their fateful meeting at the 2022 Sinquefield Cup, Magnus Carlsen and Hans Niemann will once again play a competitive chess match over the board in a big-time tournament, the semifinals of the Speed Chess Championships, on Friday in Paris. The two players' collective journey back to the same board in a high-stakes match is not quite as enthralling as their incendiary bickering match of two years ago, though they've walked rather circuitous paths back here.
We'll start with Carlsen, as his life has been far simpler than Niemann's over the past two years. Shortly after the Niemann affair, Carlsen officially ceded the title of world champion, an honor he'd held for a decade, to Ding Liren. Ding defeated former Carlsen challenger Ian Nepomniatchi in 2023, a few months before Carlsen stormed to the 2023 Chess World Cup title. He then won and defended the rapid and blitz world championships, and there's not any debate about whether or not he remains the best player in the world. His prep for this month's tournament included playing nine 3+0 games against Ediz Gurel, one of the youngest grandmasters in the world. He won eight of them, despite Gurel putting up a good fight.]]></summary>

As the peloton churned up the ridiculous slopes of the Pico Villuercas, basically a paved goat path with the dimensions of a long Koppenberg, everyone was pedaling squares, yet Roglic was the epitome of calm, his chest never heaving, his posture less rigid than coiled, his balance indisputable. When Lennert Van Eetvelt opened up the sprint, he rocked violently over his bike, his right elbow jutting out every time he raised his right foot, while Roglic's head appeared to stay in the same place as he timed his leap to perfection and came around an already-celebrating Van Eetvelt to take the stage and the leader's jersey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After moving back to Philadelphia as an adult with expendable income, I made a couple of declarations about how if anyone ever decided to open a place that did Chinese breakfast how I liked it, I would keep it afloat myself. This was silly for multiple reasons. To begin with, starting in high school, I made a habit of exchanging breakfast for 20 minutes of extra sleep, and have mostly kept it ever since. Even more embarrassingly, there already existed a place in Philly that offered all the accoutrements of my ideal breakfast, one that I had even been inside—only I'd made the mistake of thinking that it was purely a bakery joint and limited myself to snacks: sesame balls, the like.
The place is called Heung Fa Chun Sweet House, between Arch and Cherry on 10th St., but this isn't a restaurant review. Like you need me to tell you that it's good, or cheap, or that the interior layout is some humble affair, when the point at hand here is that I spent a full year hankering on about "really craving some 油條 right now, man I could really go for some 油條 right now," not knowing that I could get some 油條 posthaste with only two ounces of further research—or, say, looked at the menu on the wall when I entered. But if you were, hypothetically, going to find yourself at Heung Fa Chun Sweet House, or any other place that has my three necessary breakfast pillars, here is what to order.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most skinks look like skinks, by which I mean that most of the 1,500 or so species in the family of lizards we call skinks have the same general body plan. Skinks have no discernible neck and squat little legs. Their heads are shaped like cones and their tails are long and tapered. They have smooth, overlapping scales, like a fish. As far as appearances go, they are a predictable bunch of lizards.
But there is one funky group of skinks in—you guessed it—Australia that have bucked skink convention and evolved some relatively unorthodox bodies. Now, a group of researchers have published a paper in Current Biology explaining exactly how these weird skinks got so weird. "They have some really kind of extreme morphologies, things that I would kind of say are bizarre," said Ian Brennan, an evolutionary biologist at the Natural History Museum in London and the Australian National University in Canberra. "But it's not really fair to call them bizarre, I guess."]]></summary>
