Maybe the recent, increasingly loud din made amongst adventurous music fans in the West about Brazilian funk isn't your first introduction to it. Maybe you once downloaded those old Diplo funk compilations that came out a couple decades ago (boy, time flies!), from one of his many excursions out Daniel Plainviewing for a new sound to rip off. But maybe you didn't really give those comps much attention, easy as they were to lose in your ever-ballooning music library (shoutout to Megaupload!), and your only subsequent interactions with contemporary South American music were from passing references or short clips when a Brazilian soccer player would get ahold of the locker room's aux cord (do the kids still use those?) and put his teammates to shame with his dancing skills.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cinema tells us that when a batter steps into the box and the catcher proceeds to tell him which pitch is coming, the catcher may be doing this for one of many reasons. It might have nothing to do with the batter; the catcher could be teaching his hotshot flamethrower not to shake off his elders. It might have everything to do with the batter; perhaps he is Michael Jordan. Some pitches are so good they can be fired past anyone, even a slugger who knows what's on the way. 
A new report from ESPN's Jeff Passan and Kiley McDaniel says none of these can explain a recent game between the Lakeland Flying Tigers and the Fort Myers Mighty Mussels, Low-A affiliates of the Tigers and Twins. In the second game of a Sept. 6 doubleheader, one the Mighty Mussels needed to win to stay in the Florida State League playoff race, Flying Tigers batters were puzzled to hear 21-year-old Mussels catcher Derek Bender telling them which pitches starter Ross Dunn was about to throw.]]></summary>

The Pacific 12 Conference, which began as the Pac 8 then went to a membership of 10, and then 12, and then worryingly down to two, is now back up to six, only five of which cannot see the ocean after which the conference is named. As a result of that conference’s raid on its own ranks, the Mountain West is now slightly less mountainous and notably less western. If all pundit-based guesstimates are right it will be even less of both by Hallowe'en.

Visiting their website, I felt like I’d stumbled across a standard conservation group, or maybe a slightly pretentious yoga studio.

Instead he lunged forward, his helmet making contact with Damar Hamlin's forearm, and then banging the back of his head on the turf. A normal football play.

There was a time not all that long ago, when I started blogging, when I'd need to explain the fencing response: what it is, what it means. Not anymore. Football fans have seen it too many times—we've seen him do it too many times—while somber broadcasters cut to a commercial as the network's minor-key injury music plays. Tagovailoa instantly performed the fencing response after being tackled, and no one needed further explanation. Not again.]]></summary>
