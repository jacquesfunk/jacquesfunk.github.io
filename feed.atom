        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jim Harbaugh has this look about him that screams dotty uncle—the blinky eyes behind the old-man glasses, the slightly slack jaw, the refusal to employ the newfangled play-sheet-and-face-shield look. He's perfectly cast for a man who thinks Lawrence Welk is the cutting edge.
Thus, it was right and proper that he be the one to return the fair catch kick to our notice by stealing a last-second three-banger right before halftime of last night's Amazonapalooza in which Harbaugh's Los Angeles Chargers defeated the almost as old but not nearly so physically arresting Sean Payton and the Denver Broncos. An arcane enclave of the rulebook which was successfully employed as recently as 1976, when Harbaugh was spiritually already in his mid-40s, the fair catch kick can be employed only on a fair catch as time expires, or a penalty on a fair catch, which the Broncos' Tremon Smith gifted the Chargers on a punt that Derius Davis tried to collect with no time left on the clock. The 15-yard penalty took the ball from the Charger 38 to the Bronco 47 and offered an untimed play to provide the punishment for the penalty that would otherwise go unpunished—why, you could hear the oldey-timey gears in a million old coaches' heads at the possibilities. “It’s my favorite rule in football,” Harbaugh said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Babygirl, a movie written and directed by Dutch filmmaker Halina Reijn and starring Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson, is about facades. It's also about sex, but less about sex itself and more about what sex says about a person, and the ways we suppress our sexual appetites in order for it to say nothing about us at all. Babygirl, Reijn's second English-language film after 2022's Bodies Bodies Bodies, taps into a conservative cultural moment that is firmly anti-sex while still being in sex's thrall. It is the subject everyone wants to talk about but no one wants to see, or seemingly even have.
The movie follows tech CEO Romy Mathis (Kidman), an unabashed, all-caps GIRLBOSS who nominally "has it all": a powerful job, a big office, an eager assistant who looks up to her, a seemingly well-adjusted family that includes two daughters and a hot theater director for a husband (Antonio Banderas). But there is a restless beast inside of Romy, and vanilla sex with her husband can't appease it—so much so that Romy often finds herself having to watch dom-play porn in the bathroom afterwards in order to actually reach an orgasm. When a much younger intern for the company arrives, Samuel (Dickinson), she slowly finds herself ensnared in his web, and discovers that he is up for taming that beast. Both in spite and because of the power dynamics and the threat their affair poses to her life and career, they begin an ill-advised relationship that is hot and steamy, but most importantly effective and passionate. Romy finds her sexual needs met for the first time, which, in this movie, is as important as the tension or thriller aspects at play.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the narrow, highly specialized field of fish with blob-like attributes, one fish has dominated for decades: One would hardly dare imagine a blobbish fish without first thinking of the blobfish. But has a new blobby fish emerged to unseat this age-old champion of blobdom?
Today, a group of researchers from the nonprofit Conservation International published a report of 27 new species discovered in Alto Mayo, a region in the Peruvian Amazon. Each of the species was a singular delight: the amphibious mouse that dwells in palm swamps called aguajales; the small, stubby chestnut-colored salamander that climbs trees. But as I scrolled through the report, one species was a clear standout—a born star, never readier to accept its place in the spotlight. This, of course, was the blob-headed fish.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Christmas and the holiday season at McDonald's in the US largely consists of the Holiday Pie and holiday cups, over in the UK, the chain offers a whole holiday menu each year that includes seasonal burgers/sandwiches, a side, and desserts. They call it the "Festive Food Range."

Here's what you'll find on the 2024 holiday menu at McDonald's in the United Kingdom:


New Cheesy McCrispy - A crispy-fried chicken breast filet served with lettuce, crispy-fried onions, pickled onion chutney, bacon, Emmental cheese, and "deluxe" cheese sauce on a toasted sesame seed sourdough-style bun.
Big Tasty - A beef patty, cheese made with Emmental (similar to processed Swiss cheese), onions, tomatoes, and Big Tasty sauce (a smoky, creamy sauce), served on a toasted sesame seed bun.
Cheese Melt Dippers with Rich Tomato Dip - Breaded and fried rounds of cheese dippers made with Camembert and served with a tomato dip.
Terry's Orange Chocolate Pie - A chocolaty turnover-style pie filled with a Terry’s Chocolate Orange-flavored chocolate ganache.
Galaxy Caramel Latte - A latte blended with Galaxy Caramel-flavored syrup, topped with caramel cream and Galaxy Chocolate stars. Galaxy in the UK is what we know as Dove chocolate.
Galaxy Caramel Hot Chocolate - Hot chocolate with Galaxy Caramel-flavored syrup, topped with caramel cream and Galaxy Chocolate stars.
Galaxy Caramel McFlurry - Vanilla soft serve mixed with Galaxy Chocolate stars and topped with a Galaxy Caramel sauce.
Terry's Chocolate Orange McFlurry - Vanilla soft serve swirled with mini segments of Terry’s Chocolate Orange and topped with a Terry’s Chocolate Orange sauce.


In addition to the Festive Food Range, McDonald's UK also has a Grinch Happy Meal that includes a Grinch-themed box:



Toys for the holiday Happy Meal include Grinch and Max plushies and three different card games:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an industry-wide first, the National Labor Relations Board argued last week that contestants participating in Netflix’s hit reality TV dating show Love Is Blind should be classified as employees. If implemented into policy—which, admittedly, seems unlikely given the fact that Donald Trump is expected to fire the current NLRB general legal counsel—the filing could not only give more on-set protection to participants of shows like Love Is Blind but potentially allow them to unionize. 
Since its oddly prescient premiere in February 2020, which saw 15 men and 15 women dating, falling in love and eventually getting engaged sight unseen, Love Is Blind has faced allegations of mistreatment and coercion. Early contestants have accused producers of plying them with alcohol while regularly denying them food and water; one contestant alleged that production pushed her to continue filming even after she told them that she was experiencing suicidal ideation and wanted to leave. Over the past four years and seven seasons, the two production companies behind Love Is Blind—Kinetic Content and Delirium TV—have faced multiple lawsuits from former contestants. One of them alleges “inhumane working conditions” while another accuses Kinetic and Delirium of negligence, false imprisonment and sexual assault.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is no reason for a normal person to know who Carlos Watson is. This is why I have made it my business to reach as many members of the normal-person community with the Good News about the disgraced and deliriously scammy founder and figurehead of Ozy Media, who was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison for various oafish and common financial crimes earlier this week. I understand that my personal grievances with, say, Vice Media founder Shane Smith are my own, and my own problem; I understand, too, that there is no reason for really anyone to know who Jim Spanfeller is, although I have not always honored that. I get all this.
But it is my belief that Watson's baroquely thirsty and fraudulent public arc, while powered by the specific scamminess and scuzz of online media during the previous decade, is wild and weird enough to resonate even with people lucky enough to have avoided working in that field during that time. We put that to the test this week by having our buddy and former GMG executive editor Susie Banikarim on to talk about her new podcast about Watson's rise and fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is a beloved media tradition: when a dysfunctional team's dysfunctional season reaches its dysfunctional end, reporters covering that team are permitted to write one big notebook-dumping explainer/eulogy. With a few outré exceptions, no one cares enough about bad teams to justify two such stories; with a few outré exceptions, no team is quite dysfunctional enough to fill out more than one. If you are a Tennessee Titans fan, to take one example, this is more or less the one big thing you have left to look forward to this season. You already know the team is lousy, inert, soggy and sodden and miserable; in a few weeks, once everyone goes home, you will find out whether that has anything to do with Tony Pollard's insistence upon letting his pet puma wander around the locker room or some such thing. That is how it usually works.
But the New York Jets are different. Everyone always and already knows about the pumas wandering around the locker room. Every week their ulcerous and increasingly haggard quarterback joins Pat McAfee's ESPN show via Zoom, seemingly from the Black Lodge, and starts Speaking Real Words about the germ theory of disease or whatever else is troubling him; this week, Aaron Rodgers testily demanded that critics of his (terrible!) recent play disclose their vaccination status, either as an indication of their bias or just as proof that they lack the courage that permitted Rodgers to self-immunize against infectious disease, possibly by eating hundreds of small, smooth rocks. This is just how the Jets are, and more or less how they have been since the pharmaceutical heir Woody Johnson bought the team 25 years ago. That they have the longest streak in American pro sports without a playoff appearance is not surprising given all that, but also feels somehow incidental to the organization's broader project, which under Johnson's blithely buttheaded stewardship has mostly been to generate news about people getting fired.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the news that everything was thinking about, Mercedes announced Thursday morning that Valtteri Bottas would be returning to the team as its reserve driver. Bottas spent the past three years as an unfortunate, i.e. racing for Alfa Romeo–turned–Kick Sauber, but up until 2021, Bottas had represented everything a championship-winning team needed in a second driver: fast enough to ensure 1-2 finishes, good enough in qualifying to occasionally beat Lewis Hamilton, not quite good enough to disrupt a clear 1-2 hierarchy. The full circle continues what has been considered one of the kinder arcs for a second driver post-eviction: freed from the pressure of one-year contracts and matching up against literally Lewis Hamilton, Bottas grew a mullet and a mustache, posted ass, and then managed to return to Mercedes with zero expectations.
If Sergio Pérez has half that, he will be fortunate. Red Bull announced yesterday that Pérez would be leaving the team after three seasons. Pérez is already missing out on the clean end-of-term-into-multi-year-contract-with-another-team sequence that Bottas got. Lest anyone forgets, Pérez's contract was initially due to expire at the end of the 2024 season, but six months ago, Red Bull Racing announced that they had extended his contract by two years. This was a baffling decision at face value, but could be explained by the disaster of Red Bull leadership, McLaren evading consideration as legitimate Constructors' Championship contender, Daniel Ricciardo still being in the second VCARB seat, and Pérez having a far worse second half of the season compared to his first—he had four podiums prior to the extension, and zero after. In the end, Red Bull had to worm its way out of an easily avoidable extension, and took a no doubt expensive route to an inevitable result; Sergio Pérez lasted for longer than expected, but he, too, fell victim to the curse of the second Red Bull seat.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taco Bell's Crispy Chicken Nuggets feature white-meat chicken bites marinated in jalapeno buttermilk," breaded with a mix of breadcrumbs and tortilla chips, and then deep-fried.

A 10-piece order included two dipping sauces and cost me $7.49. I went with the new Bell Sauce and Hidden Valley Fire Ranch.
There was quite a bit of variance in the size of the nuggets. The smallest piece was about half the size of the largest piece:



The breading was fairly thick with an almost knobby texture to it. I could see bits of tortilla chips sporadically embedded in it and some odd dark patches on the surface. It was lightly crispy but super crunchy when a piece of chip was encountered. The chicken inside was moist and decently tender. There was a lightly seasoned flavor to the nuggets and just a hint of spicy heat. Quality-wise, it's about the same level as frozen breaded chicken bites heated in the air fryer.



The new Bell Sauce offered a sweet tomato flavor and a distinct pepper note to go with a fair amount of spices, a mild heat, and a creamy, tangy mayo base.
The Hidden Valley Fire Ranch is a mixture of Hidden Valley Ranch and Fire Sauce. It was more run-of-the-mill versus the Bell Sauce. It offered the creamier buttermilk tang and herbiness of Hidden Valley ranch with an additional hit of tang and a moderate heat from Taco Bell's Fire Sauce.



I found both sauces enjoyable but preferred the Bell Sauce as it was more complex and interesting.
At the end of the day, Taco Bell's Crispy Chicken Nuggets made for a decent but middling fast-food chicken nugget offering but with some added novelty from the new sauces.

        <id>https://defector.com/?p=176547</id>
        <link href="https://defector.com/presenting-the-2024-shamsy"/>
        <updated>2024-12-19T16:51:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was an eventful year for our award's namesake. Shams Charania's mentor-turned-rival Adrian Wojnarowski left ESPN in September to take a job in college basketball. Just three weeks later, Charania left The Athletic and assumed Woj's place as "Senior NBA Insider." This was perhaps always his destiny, since he was a news-breaking teenage prodigy: to speak his beautiful sentences on linear TV, to appear in a little photo inset for news graphics. In November, Charania was granted an award for basketball writing besides ours: first place in the Professional Basketball Writers Association's 2024 Blumenthal Memorial Writing Contest, for his co-bylined work with The Athletic's Jon Krawczynski. If any of the other awardees are reading this post, please reach out: We're curious to know what it's like to learn that you have won an award for good writing, and then, within the same sentence, learn that Shams Charania has also won it.
It is momentous to present the Shamsy in this strange year of "artificial intelligence." Sometimes critics compare the scoopster prose style to the output of a large language model; I find this funny, but off the mark. While often factually wrong and semantically hollow, an LLM's sentences typically scan like sentences that real humans might produce. Perhaps lazy or thoughtless humans trying to cheat on their homework, but real ones. These models are, after all, trained on a huge corpus of human writing. But the compositions of Shamsy award winners are compelling precisely because they deviate from default human rhythms. Man has not yet devised an intelligence that can report a Jarred Vanderbilt injury in such a disorienting fashion. For now, the human mind is more flavorfully stupid than its technological successors. That's what makes these nominees some of the most innovative writers working today, and that's why we're grateful to sift through these submissions.]]></summary>
