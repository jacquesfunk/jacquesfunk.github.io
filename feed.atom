        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the time of writing, on Dec. 2, 2024, Liverpool is nine points clear at the top of the Premier League table. The Pool Boys have been in torrid form domestically this season: 11 wins, one draw to second-place Arsenal, and one less-shocking-by-the-day loss to sixth-place Nottingham Forest. That run of 13 games includes wins over third-place Chelsea, fourth-place Brighton, and an always-pleasant thrashing of rival Manchester United. As of Sunday, it also includes a quite comfortable 2-0 victory over Manchester City, a club in full-blown crisis, insomuch as the Sky Blues can be in crisis; the loss to Liverpool threw City into fifth place, and the reigning champions have not won in seven matches across all competitions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The theory of the dribble handoff is sound: The hub, typically a center brutish enough to dislodge trailing defenders with a screen but adept enough with the rock to make quick passing decisions, scrambles typical pick-and-roll coverage by simultaneously acting as both ball-handler and screener. With a live dribble, they have the latitude to punish overzealous help defense and dictate the angle of the screen. The player coming around the DHO can either pop into open space or attack a slightly shifted defense, with the hub either rolling or popping themselves. 
One NBA team, Sacramento, has made the DHO the foundation of its half-court offense. This made total sense when the Kings implemented the system two seasons ago and won 48 games; it also helps explain why the team is currently drawing dead in a conference that has passed them by.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Justin Tucker sat encased in a sideline cape and hidden under a hood, alone with his thoughts and the millions of other people thinking them. He had just missed a 53-yard field goal that would have put the Baltimore Ravens ahead of the Philadelphia Eagles, and Tucker looked more than just morose. He looked even more than baffled. The most productive NFL kicker of the last decade looked like the living embodiment of a yip.
People speak of the yips often, usually in relation to a golfer with putting issues; for whatever it may be worth, the Oxford English Dictionary pegs the first use of the term as having been in 1935, in American Golfer. Everyone agrees on what it is: the sudden inability to perform a task one has performed many times before because the one performing the task is thinking too hard about the task itself and becoming overwhelmed by the very idea. It’s less that the task becomes more difficult and more that it just slips further and further out of perspective.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Saturday, the San Jose State women's volleyball season came to an end, as the Spartans were beaten in four sets by the Colorado State Rams in the Mountain West Conference championship. A top seed comfortably prevailing over a second seed in a small conference tournament final is not a particularly remarkable or noteworthy outcome, but SJSU's tournament run gained national attention thanks to the hard work of people who hate sports almost as much as they hate transgender people.
Last week, ESPN's Katie Barnes published a long and deeply reported story about SJSU's volleyball season, which I highly recommend you read. The short version is that earlier this year an anti-trans activist group called Independent Council on Women's Sports (ICONS) and professional bigot Riley Gaines trained their sights on SJSU's volleyball team, claiming that the team has a transgender player. (The player in question has not been named in non-reactionary media coverage.) In March, ICONS and Gaines filed a lawsuit against the NCAA seeking to overturn the policies that allow transgender athletes to play sports. In September, SJSU co-captain Brooke Slusser joined the lawsuit, claiming that the presence of a transgender player on her team posed a safety risk to her teammates and opponents.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Washington Wizards started the season at a plucky 2-2. Perhaps that was pluckier than they intended. They proceeded to lose all 14 games they played in November, settling in the muck at a league-worst 2-16. This would be bleak new territory for most teams, but incredibly, this is not even the franchise's first winless month in the current calendar year. Last season's Wizards went 0-12 in February. That was part of a larger 16-game losing streak, tied for the worst in franchise history. Should the current Wizards lose three more games—and, given that the opponents are the Cavs, Mavs, and Nuggets, they might—they would claim that franchise record instead.
Another astonishing aspect is how uncompetitive the games themselves have been. The Wizards lost all 14 games in this streak by a margin of at least nine points, which had never been accomplished in NBA history. In 10 of those games, they were blown out by at least 15 points. The team is omni-directionally bad, with both the league's worst offensive rating and the worst defensive rating and, as such, the worst net rating, a gruesome -14.1.]]></summary>

Lawrence lay motionless on the field in what looked like a fencing response. But it was hard to see all of Lawrence's body because, almost immediately, a fight broke out. After Al-Shaair made the tackle, Jaguars tight end Evan Engram rushed over and shoved him, and players from both teams escalated the clash. At one point, the broadcast showed a huge swath of players on one sideline as the fight wound down while, further away, a handful of personnel tended to Lawrence. ESPN's Michael DiRocco reported that "an official knelt to protect Lawrence as the skirmish moved toward the Jaguars sideline."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the second time in 2024, one of the best tennis players in the world has violated anti-doping rules. The International Tennis Integrity Agency announced Thursday that Iga Swiatek, currently the world No. 2, tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine, a heart medication used in Europe and Asia to treat angina. It was detected in an out-of-competition test Swiatek provided just ahead of the Cincinnati Open in August, the ITIA said. Swiatek formally admitted to the anti-doping rules violation and accepted a one-month ban from the sport; her three weeks of provisional suspension earlier in the year count toward that ban and she is currently serving the remaining eight days during a meaningless stretch of the tennis calendar. She was also stripped of $158,944 in prize money and 390 ranking points for her semifinal run in Cincinnati.
Swiatek previously had a provisional suspension as she sought to explain the source of the trimetazidine to the ITIA. While doing so, she missed tournaments in Seoul, Beijing, and Wuhan in September and October. Swiatek was able to have her suite of at least 14 supplements analyzed to identify a possible source of contamination. She concluded that the culprit was her melatonin, which Swiatek has long used, she said, because with "all my traveling, jet lag and work-related stress mean that sometimes without it, I couldn’t fall asleep." She provided both an opened and unopened containers of the melatonin to the ITIA, which had them analyzed and found the contamination consistent with the trace amounts of trimetazidine detected in Swiatek's urine sample. Her provisional suspension was lifted and she was able to continue competing at the WTA's year-end finals, per the ITIA decision.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Michigan beat Ohio State on Saturday for the fourth season in a row. The win gave this year's senior class at Michigan a clean sweep over their longtime Buckeye rivals, and it was a stunning upset as OSU hosted the game and came into it ranked second in the country. Sure, college players are increasingly transferring between programs and extending their careers into their mid-twenties, but facts like that mean little next to the emotions of a longstanding rivalry that goes back more than a century. The most important fact of all is that Ohio State and Michigan hate each other. When the Wolverines won in Columbus, 13-10, and a player tried to plant a Michigan flag on the field, a brawl unsurprisingly followed.
Reporters were already on the field when the fight broke out, and Nicole Shearin of WBNS got video of what happened. The Michigan player, carrying a Michigan flag on a pole, walked up to an area of the field and motioned as if to plant the flag. He was slowed down, first by what looked like people in Ohio State clothing, followed by someone in Michigan clothing who put his arms around the player. The Michigan player wasn't able to plant the flag, but kept talking as Ohio State athletes filled up the area. Video from another angle by UMGoBlue showed that after the failed flag planting, an Ohio State player grabbed the cloth part of the Michigan flag and ripped it off its pole. In the videos, this is when the fight started. (A different video also showed former Wolverine turned broadcaster Jason Avant securing the loose Michigan flag, but it's hard to tell when that happened relative to everything else.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States Women's National Team is currently in Europe to play a pair of friendlies that will thoroughly stretch the meaning of that designation.
First up is a date with England at Wembley, both a homecoming for USWNT coach Emma Hayes and a fascinating opportunity to consider the dynamics of the transatlantic soccer exchange on both the Olympic champions and the European champions. Hayes, of course, made her name managing Chelsea for over a decade, though she got her start coaching in New York, a bit north of where Three Lionesses manager Sarina Wiegman played college soccer. USWNT vets have enjoyed short stints in England, and so many England players have tussled in the NWSL that The Athletic ran a long story with quotes from each payer about how physical and demanding the standard of play was stateside. The game is not exactly a referendum on whose development environment is better, though it does provide an occasion to think seriously about at the state of the best women's club league and the second-best as it closes the gap. It's also a serious test for both teams with close to their full rosters.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Growing up, my grandma lived in a small green house that sat under a towering cottonwood tree on the south side of Minneapolis. She had many old things, or at least things that felt old to my young brain: a cast-iron fireplace that looked like it could forge steel, a massive wooden cabinet TV that hummed and seemed almost radioactive, a whole rainbow's worth of colorful mixing bowls that were sturdy enough to survive in the oven.
The bowls are what I remember the most, because I remember the kitchen more vividly than anything else. On holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter, work would start in the narrow galley of a kitchen very early and it would go late, until family arrived, until the very minute everyone sat at the table, through the combative games of Uno to decide who would do dishes after no one was foolish enough to eat more.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently stayed at a blandly business-oriented hotel in San Jose in order to celebrate my birthday, drink a tall boy, and watch the Sharks lose. You know this type of hotel. There were white duvet covers, white sheets, beige walls, dark wood for the closet and bathroom doors. There was a nice light under a wall bench to help you find your way to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The soundproofing was good.
There was also, of course, a picture on the wall. There is always a picture on the wall in hotel rooms. It was a photograph and it showed a cement wall and floor belonging to what seemed to be a warehouse building.]]></summary>
