        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the Champions League schedule came out, the Matchday Seven showdown between Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City looked to be a veritable clash of the titans, but I have to admit I was a bit underwhelmed by its timing. Thanks to the new league-stage format, I figured that two of Europe's most expensively assembled sides would be safely through to the knockouts by this point, and that the match wouldn't have all that much riding on it.
I was wrong on two counts. First, I have to admit I did not foresee that El Gásico would be not a matchup at the top of the table, but rather a true battle of survival. Entering Wednesday's match in Paris, both clubs were in a klaxon-worthy panic, marooned in the bottom third of the 36-team table and in real jeopardy of missing the knockout round all together. My second mistake was in assuming that a PSG-City match would be anything but a banger, an intuition that seemed to bear out during the scoreless first half, only to explode into a delirious 4-2 PSG comeback win that might have been the most entertaining match of the campaign.]]></summary>

Every day, I have to boot up a PC we borrowed from my brother-in-law and scroll through listings on Monster that are either fake jobs, or jobs I’ve already seen listed 500 times before.

We only have one car—a champagne Honda Accord her parents let us have—so I’m her ride to and from work. I have to pick her up every day just after five, but sometimes her work runs a little bit long and I stay in the car to wait.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Oscar nominees for 2025 were announced Thursday morning. The list for Best Original Score caused a minor stir in Defector's Slack when it was observed that the score of Challengers, by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, didn't make the cut. Reznor and Ross have been nominated before, lots of times, for lots of different awards. They've won a couple Oscars already, a BAFTA, an Emmy, three Golden Globes, and probably some Grammys. The score for Challengers was well-received and memorable, and was an important part of a well-reviewed film. And like most Reznor and Ross joints, it's something a normal person might choose to bump on their car's sound system, in those moments where they feel like driving very fast. Certainly I will not be jamming out to the score of The Wild Robot, a movie I had never heard of before this morning.
Unfortunately, I am forced to rush to the defense of the Academy in this case. However jaunty and fun the rest of the Challengers score may be, the Academy was right to penalize Reznor and Ross for having created the song "Yeah x10," which is the most irritating piece of music imaginable.]]></summary>

The students were both in the same mammalogy class at the University of California, Berkeley, which included trips teaching students how to catch, handle, and process small mammals. On one such trip, Jain brought his camera and snapped some shots of voles and deer mice. Curious if there were any other small and obscure mammals nearby to photograph, Jain perused a list of the mammals of California and noticed that one species, the Mount Lyell shrew, had never been photographed before. "I was immediately fascinated," Jain said.
Jain told Subramanyan about the shrew in September, and the two hatched a scheme. Subramanyan, who has since graduated from Berkeley, is a wildlife conservation photographer and a creator in the California Academy of Science's California Creators for Nature program. Neither Jain nor Subramanyan had worked with a species like a shrew before; Subramanyan ordinarily photographs wildlife giants such as mountain lions and wolves, and Jain ordinarily photographs itty-bitty invertebrates, such as scorpions and arachnids. The small shrew offered them a chance to meet in the middle.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The further we get away from the 2016 Democratic National Convention the more I become convinced that Michelle Obama standing on that stage saying, “When they go low, we go high,” was a death knell. By now, she’s realized it. In the brief period of this past election cycle where the Democrats were trying to win, calling Donald Trump and J.D. Vance “weird”, she backed away from the statement on the convention stage. But then, just as suddenly, Democrats backed off their line of attack. Why try something new, to seeming success, when you could run the same old playbook to failure?
The reason that phrase sticks in my head is because it was a failed strategy from the get-go. If your opponent is “going low,” following the rules will not help you. You will not be given a gold star by the teacher. In fact, it will only give your opponent more space and opportunity to play dirty. The Republicans (who are winning politics, currently) know that they are in a competition, and that the Democrats are their opponents and enemies. They behave like it. Democrats, over and over again, seem to be trying to prove that they are not actually in a feud with Republicans. In their efforts at peace-keeping, they allow violence to reign. They are unable or unwilling to fight.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even prodigies must learn hard lessons in public sometimes. Carlos Alcaraz has won four major titles and extracts tennis wisdom at a disturbing rate, but there are plenty of situations on court that the 21-year-old has yet to confront. In Tuesday’s Australian Open quarterfinal against the 37-year-old Novak Djokovic, Alcaraz lost, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4, and learned how to grapple with an opponent whose injury did not prevent him from playing at a world-historical level. 
At 4-4 in the first set, Djokovic slid hard while running to his right and seemed to tweak something in his left groin, causing him to grimace and stretch it out. On his next serve, he struggled to push off the ground with that leg. He lost the ensuing rally then shook his head at his player’s box, suggesting that he wasn’t right. Injury suddenly imperiled the most anticipated match of the men’s draw in Melbourne. After having his serve broken, Djokovic was evaluated by a physiotherapist, who took him off court to wrap up his left thigh. A doctor administered a dose of painkillers. Djokovic returned to the court and lost the first set to Alcaraz, who looked unfazed.]]></summary>

In the second week The Artist's Way asks readers to consider the role other people can play in aiding—or stifling—one's creative practices. Well, this is certainly an inconvenient time to be introspective about the wider world intruding into creative work. But this week's readings were a helpful reminder of how much of an effect the people in your life can have.
This week the gang looked into our roadblocks, took trips to the museum and the coffeeshop and encouraged our Sims characters to try to date more. It's all part of the process!

Unroll the plastic sheeting, queue up Kool & The Gang on the sound system, and prepare yourselves for a party. Over the last week, the Jazz took several large steps toward the accomplishment of their mission for the 2024–25 NBA season. Despite hardships and long odds, the team now controls its own destiny. The finish line is in sight.
The Jazz, after a most unfortunate Jan. 12 victory, found themselves with a record of 10–28, good for only second worst in the Western Conference, and only fifth worst in the NBA. That win, over the Brooklyn Nets, came despite the best efforts of the team's front office, which invented, embellished, and lucked into minimally plausible reasons for de-activating five of their top six scorers, including giving "rest" to 23-year-old center Walker Kessler, the team's best defender and rim protector. The Nets, not to be outdone, sat their four top scorers, and snuck off with the loss in overtime.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jason Kelce retired on March 4, 2024. His long-rumored exit from the NFL came after 13 years at center for the Philadelphia Eagles. He’ll likely make the Pro Football Hall of Fame. As chronicled in the 2023 documentary Kelce, he married Philadelphia native Kylie McDevitt; they still live in the Philadelphia suburbs. Kelce played center, so he was basically anonymous to anyone but hardcore football fans until his rousing speech at the Super Bowl victory parade in 2018. He donned a Mummers costume and listed the many ways people doubted the Eagles. It was pretty great. It earned him a lifetime of admiration in the city and put him on a trajectory for a much bigger profile outside of it.
Kelce has indeed stayed retired from the sport, but he has not gone away. He has become not just the most famous interior lineman in American public life by a wide margin, but a mostly inescapable fixture during NFL broadcasts and a completely inescapable one during the commercial breaks in NFL broadcasts, where he banters with his brother or his mom or the CGI buffalo mascot of Buffalo Wild Wings. He has continued to co-host one of the most popular sports podcasts, New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce, which launched in September of 2022. He contributed to a third Christmas album featuring the Philadelphia offensive line; one song on A Philly Special Christmas Party was a duet with Kelce and Stevie Nicks. He got involved in a match at WrestleMania 40 in Philly. He smashed some asshole’s phone. He and Kylie Kelce were harangued down the shore by a drunk lady. Kylie now has a popular podcast, too.]]></summary>

This leads us to assume if nothing else that Japanese fans don't have America’s unanimity fetish, let alone our propensity to be annoying scolds.
Suzuki was approved to headline the July dog-and-pony extravaganza in Cooperstown by 393 of the 394 participating voters, which meant of course that the hunt was on for the one recalcitrant Hall of Fame voter who either didn't watch baseball for 19 consecutive years, forgot who he was voting for because nobody uses Ichiro’s last name, or was too excited to check off Troy Tulowitzki's name to read the one after C.C. Sabathia. Whatever the reason, that was the main takeaway from Tuesday's announcement—that everyone got a chance to screech about the one person who had disgraced and perhaps ruined baseball forever by not voting for one of the most obviously deserving players of his era.]]></summary>

If the average Defector reader isn't interested in a blog about a midseason blowout featuring two teams outside of the playoff picture, well, too bad. Go write a Becky Blog, or whatever your name is. Because I need to record this for posterity. Tuesday night, I had the best seats I've ever had to a hockey game in my life, and I saw a Matt Rempe goal. May as well tell me not to blog a total solar eclipse!
Thanks to benefactors who shall go unnamed, because I don't know Lauren's parents' names, a Defector contingent of two attended a 5-0 Rangers win over the Senators that felt even more lopsided than that thanks to two disallowed New York goals. We were directly behind the Ottawa net, four rows back. (I spammed our work chat with semi-blurry photos of local sentimental favorite Artem Zub. "Whoa," responded Samer with rude and uncharacteristic sarcasm. "Big game," responded Ray with fully characteristic sarcasm.) Lauren, with typical Red Wings fan bravado, taunted me about the sub-Cup banners in the MSG rafters—the "mere" division titles, the Billy Joel sellouts, the fucking Phish banner.]]></summary>

The next day, the price of a bitcoin exceeded $100,000 for the first time, a clear sign that the fourth cryptocurrency boom was on and that the incoming Trump administration would make good on his campaign promises to loosen the industry's regulatory reigns. The days of federal skepticism and persecution were over. The industry rejoiced. Its planet-killing money laundering apparatus would finally be legitimated.
Amid the broader horrors unveiled over inauguration weekend, Trump also launched a pair of memecoins; by the time the former crypto skeptic was inaugurated a few days later, the fully diluted value of $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens had stabilized near a combined $44 billion. Instead of getting what they wanted on the first day of the Trump presidency, the crypto traditionalist wing got surprised. Many of its members were furious, with Mark Cuban worrying that "people will think memecoins are the foundation of the crypto industry," and Lead Lag Report's Michael Gayed decrying "a general level of disgust" with the launch. "I do believe this puts into question some of Trump's credibility when we have a president-elect enrich himself just before inauguration and make a mockery of an entire ecosystem," Gayed told the Wall Street Journal.]]></summary>

Food trucks parked along the north curb of Independence Avenue Saturday afternoon pumped great-smelling fried stuff to euphoric blonde types in the usual assortment of tacky Trump gear. Big corn-fed-looking college-aged bros clustered at crosswalks, even smirkier and chestier than usual.
The generally delightful cafe in the lobby of the Hirshhorn Museum was clogged with shiny-faced weirdos in American flag sweaters and white and gold caps proclaiming "Donald Trump Was Right About Everything," milling around near a window and waiting for their various lattes. The exhibit one floor down from the lobby was titled Basquiat x Banksy, and featured Jean-Michel Basquiat's gorgeous Boy and Dog in a Johnnypump, over which Banksy had contributed Banksquiat: Boy and Dog in Stop and Search, with his usual thudding anti-subtlety. The exhibit is funded in part by conservative billionaire investor Kenneth C. Griffin, who purchased Boy and Dog in a Johnnypump in 2020 for more than $100 million, the same year that he threatened to move the offices of his hedge fund out of Illinois in protest of a graduated income tax.]]></summary>

Patrick Kluivert is one of the top scorers in the national team's history, and he spearheaded the Oranje attack at the 1994 and 1998 World Cups, where the Netherlands reached the quarterfinals and semifinals, respectively. This is all to say that when Kluivert's son Justin came up through the famed Ajax youth system last decade, people paid attention.
The younger Kluivert might have had the name and the developmental pedigree, debuting at the age of 17 for Ajax's senior side, but he didn't quite have "it" in the same way his father did. The early promise of his Ajax years earned him a €19 million move to Roma in 2018, but his progression soon stalled. A couple unexceptional Serie A seasons were followed by loans to Leipzig, Nice, and Valencia, but the former wunderkind's star looked to have already faded. When he moved to Bournemouth in the summer of 2023, there was surprisingly little noise made about a player once surrounded by so much buzz.]]></summary>

We also expect them to be full-on pathological liars, emotional manipulators, self-absorbed bullies, and dictators, and in general people only appreciate them for that once they've been fired. Often because they are fired. It’s complicated. See Nick Sirianni for further elucidation.
So when we say that Manchester United's still new-ish manager Ruben Amorim is seeking out weird new territory, we're saying something. Amorim not only says this is currently coaching the worst Manchester United team ever (which is historically inaccurate), he also says that he is actively hurting the team (which might be part of the design). He is just eleven games into his tenure and is already blowing up the job, himself included.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was a kid, like a lot of kids in the ‘80s, I had a View-Master. I had a few View-Masters, actually. You may have seen them before—they were these little red camera-looking things, with what looked like a visor in the middle and a little orange lever on the side. They were a kind of mini-photo projector. When you bought them, you also got a bunch of little round cards dotted along the edges with slides. The card fit into a slot, and every time you pushed the lever, a new slide would pop up with a new image. It made a satisfying click sound. I remember having an E.T. one, but they also had cards for television shows and toys. Mine were all movies. It wasn’t like watching the film, but it was kind of 3D and it was better than reading a short interview in some teen magazine, which is all you could really get in those days if you were a kid looking for more engagement with your favorite movies (VHS tapes rarely had special features). The images passed by one after the other, as you flipped through, retelling the story in distinct parts. It was full of holes, but it hit important notes, like Gertie kissing E.T. over that flower. Your memory of the movie itself filled in the blanks.
View-Masters first came out in 1939, on the back of high-quality color photos. But they weren’t that different from Eadweard Muybridge’s projected discs of The Horse in Motion from 1878. Considered to be the first bit of proto-cinema, the photographer’s glass discs, dotted with images of a horse in various stages of gallop, were cycled through an early version of the movie projector that he called, for obvious reasons, a zoopraxiscope. The whole thing came less out of artistic aspiration than scientific inquiry—a man just wanted to know what position a horse’s feet actually went through when it moved really fast, which was hard to see with the naked eye. Muybridge captured the motion, but also the parts that made it up; movement through time was important, but the individual images were too.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Connor McDavid is having a quiet season by his standards, which means he's got 65 points in 43 games—ho hum. He's still the scariest person on the ice with the puck on his stick, and if an opponent can take him out of a play at the cost of one of their own, there's not a player alive they wouldn't make that trade for. Unfortunately for McDavid, "superstar calls" in the NHL work the opposite way—less skilled defenders are more or less allowed to harass, pester, and otherwise torment the league's most talented skaters, right up to and slightly past the line of a foul, because officials simply won't call the rulebook to the letter if it'd mean whistling a penalty every seven seconds. It's enough to frustrate anyone into cross-checking Conor Garland in the face.
In the wild closing seconds of Vancouver's 3-2 win over Edmonton on Saturday, Garland took it upon himself to remove McDavid as a threat. Keep an eye on them during the last-minute barrage in the Canucks' end: Garland pulls McDavid to the ice and holds his arm so he can't get up. McDavid throws a punch, gets to his skates—and is promptly wrapped up and dragged down a second time. That was enough for him. After getting to his feet again, he delivered a cross-check to Garland's grill. Can't do that.]]></summary>

The Buckeyes dismantled Notre Dame, 34-23, and despite a valiant effort by the Irish in the second half, the result was never really in much doubt. It was a fitting end to the scorched-earth campaign undertaken by the Buckeyes and head coach Ryan Day who, following an embarrassing 13-10 loss to rival Michigan, went on to blow out Tennessee, then No. 1 seed Oregon, then Texas, and finally Notre Dame. After all that, Ryan Day has finally proven he can win the big one, and the projected $20 million that was spent in NIL money to put together this championship roster ended up being a worthwhile investment.
Ohio State quarterback Will Howard threw for 231 yards on 17-of-21 passing, ran for another 57 yards, and finished with two touchdowns and no interceptions. After executing an 18-play drive to score first, which included nine QB runs by Riley Leonard, the Irish spent the rest of the first half completely shut out. Leonard threw for 255 yards overall and ran for 40. Although Leonard led a decent comeback to get back within eight points in the second half, Ohio State had too much firepower to feel truly threatened.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s mix opens with a KMRU track and then a couple of scores: Theodore Shapiro’s Severance and Angelo Badalamenti’s Twin Peaks. There are piano-led instrumentals by Greta Morgan (more on her tomorrow) and molly leach. We play two new guitar instrumentals from Blue Lake and SUSS – the latter is an ambient country cover of “This Land Is Your Land.” We get into deeper guitar cuts by Durutti Column, Barry Archive Johnson, and The Deku Trio. We selected three beats from Madlib’s Yesterday’s New Quintet project, and then the mix winds down with dub techno from Porter Ricks and Museum. We hope you enjoy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nothing lingers in the aftermath of failure quite like the decision not taken that could have become success. Thus, the Baltimore Ravens will spend the next eight months asking why, with their last chance to advance to the AFC championship game against Kansas City, they chose not to make the safe and logically defensible play to save themselves with their most reliable weapon. With two yards and two points to gain that would have put the Ravens in a 27-27 tie with the Buffalo Bills, they decided not to use running back Derrick Henry to get them, and the result will operate as a trigger for years of recriminations, because that's how sports works—the losses always linger longer.
And the most maddening thing for the Ravens and their fans is that the play they called that would have tied the game worked brilliantly, all the way until the moment that ultra-reliable tight end Mark Andrews dropped the sure-thing conversion pass from Lamar Jackson that brought the Ravens down. It was a simple physical mistake, not a miscalculation or a mental blunder, that sent the Bills to their annual date with Kansas City this coming Sunday, and for Andrews, who had also fumbled earlier in the fourth quarter to help the Bills take an eight-point lead, the agony will be a tattoo on his chest that can be summoned on demand by NFL Films.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deniz Selman’s family moved to Philadelphia from Turkey when he was four. His parents were basketball fans and quickly became attached to the Sixers, who won the NBA title that season, but the Eagles were an afterthought. The sport was unfamiliar.
Selman first attended an Eagles game when they hosted the Miami Dolphins in December 1987. His family had seats in the first row of Veterans Stadium from which it was basically impossible to see the game, so they ended up getting glimpses of the game while wandering the stadium. The Eagles lost, 28-10, as Dan Marino threw for 376 yards and three touchdowns. Despite that, Selman quickly got hooked on the Birds.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On paper, the Houston Texans outperformed expectations. They ran more plays  than the Kansas City Chiefs, possessed the ball for longer, were better on third down, and had more total yards. The defense harried quarterback Patrick Mahomes, and after halftime the offense put together a 10-minute drive to score a touchdown to put the score within one. Ultimately, none of this mattered. Houston would have lost by double digits on Saturday if not for an intentional safety by the Chiefs at the end of their 23-14 divisional-round victory, sending them to a seventh straight AFC title game.
Neither team lost a fumble or threw an interception, but the Texans still made a few costly mistakes. Kansas City's Nikko Remigio returned the opening kick 63 yards, and afterward Houston's Kris Boyd was flagged for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, giving the Chiefs a red-zone appearance within 13 seconds of the game. The normally reliable Texans kicker Ka'imi Fairbairn missed an extra point and a 55-yard field goal try, and had another FG attempt blocked. Houston seemed to be facing a second opponent in the play clock, and on one occasion, a rushed fourth-and-10 call was doomed before it could really develop, resulting in a 16-yard sack of Texans QB C.J. Stroud. Early in the first quarter, he came up limping after a run, and he became easier to hit. Stroud threw for 245 yards as he absorbed eight total sacks.]]></summary>
