        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When researchers look at what effects astronauts could face on long-term missions, exploring Mars or beyond, one thing they tend to focus on something called the "third-quarter" effect. It's a sports-y sounding name for something we all might be familiar with, that feeling when morale tends to hit a low point in the third quarter of long missions. It makes sense that the middle is always the roughest time. The beginning and end benefit from excitement, either from just beginning or from being almost done. Right in the middle of a process is usually where morale sags the most, so if you can get through that period, things will almost certainly start to feel better. 
We are smack dab in the middle of the third quarter of The Artist's Way, and morale is sagging, predictably. Luckily we are not astronauts and can blog from right here on Earth. If you're following along with us, maybe you're feeling the drag too. The good news is that the fourth quarter is in sight.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Oklahoma City Thunder just split two games in two days against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was incredible in both, notching 76 total points, 18 rebounds, and 16 assists. If you wanted to understand what makes SGA so good and cool, Sunday night's 130-123 gem was the ideal one-game sample; if you want to understand why he matters so much and why the largely untouchable Thunder still face so many big questions, Monday night's horrific loss was equally instructive.
So much of what makes the Thunder special is collective: their heat-seeking defense, unmatchable depth, team-wide shooting. As team setups go, having a dozen players who can defend as if armed and who generally play basketball at what appears to be 1.25x speed is certainly more unusual and interesting than surrounding one or two superstars with a roster purpose-built to their talents. The Thunder's formula does, however, rely on a number of stylistic hallmarks that tend to be marginalized by the differences between regular and postseason hoops. Can they still force turnovers on like every third possession in the playoffs? Will their depth really matter when they have to play against opposing rotations stripped of all their weak players?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his own words, Pankaj Mishra wrote his latest book not to describe the atrocities in Gaza, which have been well documented, but "to ask some very basic questions: How can human beings treat other human beings this way? And to also ask people today, or readers today: How can we allow this to happen? How could we allow something like Gaza to happen?"
The World After Gaza, based off Mishra's 2024 essay for the London Review of Books, uses the historical context following World War II to deliver a meaningful reminder: The West did not welcome Holocaust survivors with open arms. In fact, the global powers treated them as a nuisance and looked to relocate them elsewhere. The current-day narrative, that the West immediately recognized the Holocaust was an atrocity, is a comforting fiction. As is, Mishra argues, the idea that the international standard of laws and norms set in 1945 can remain legitimate after having been abandoned in service to Israeli objectives.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2016, when Donald Trump was elected president the first time, people felt scared but also called to action. Protests began instantly, starting literally the day after the election. People were hyper aware of Trump's attempts to lie to the public, were vigilant about his racist, xenophobic, homophobic, and sexist policies, and were vocal in their opposition throughout his term in office. Within that storm of dissent, rap music echoed its revolutionary past by sounding off against Trump. Artists like Snoop Dogg and Jay-Z voiced their anger. Acts like A Tribe Called Quest and YG wrote protest songs. Any given verse of the era was likely to include at least one stray line aimed at the president; my personal favorite was Young Thug's "I'll slap the shit out Donald Trump any day" on Swae Lee's "Offshore."
This seemed to genuinely bother Trump. Trump had long been a folk hero for rappers, as rappers have a tendency to be our most vocal champions of ruthless capitalism. Trump's combination of wealth, outsized bravado, attention-hungry charisma, and over-the-top egomania put him on similar terms with Ric Flair and Tony Montana, two characters who are also exalted in rap songs. Plenty of rappers never bought into his persona certainly, but he was a source of inspiration for many, as proven by how often he was name-checked. Rappers turning on him had to feel like a betrayal to a creature as vain as Trump.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PITTSBURGH — I've known the names of hockey players for as long as I've known my own. I was lucky enough to be born in Michigan in 1995, just before the Red Wings restored their old glory with back-to-back Stanley Cup wins, and the state's enthusiasm for that team implanted in me a love for the sport that's inextricable from my sense of self. There's video evidence to prove this—me sitting on the floor, lording over a rink symbolized by an oval-shaped train track, using blocks as players while I played PA announcer for an imaginary game at Joe Louis Arena. When I was a few years older, I remember making use of a big, bench-like windowsill at the front of our house, orchestrating games with action figures of guys like Brendan Shanahan, Sergei Fedorov, Paul Kariya, and Peter Forsberg. In the basement, I'd watch VHS recaps of the Wings' '98 Cup triumph, or a compilation of interviews and player profiles for stars like Chris Chelios and Pavel Bure.
What all those players had in common, from my perspective, was that they were established greats, and my knowledge had to catch up to their careers. But that all changed in 2005, when a pair of heavily hyped young prospects each made their debut in the aftermath of a season-cancelling lockout. Alex Ovechkin, first overall in 2004, and Sidney Crosby, picked No. 1 in 2005, were the future. They were the first NHLers I was conscious of knowing before they were actually in the NHL. And as their careers inch closer to the finish line, and I creep closer to my 30th birthday, I'm extra aware of the conduit that these two provide to the person I was two decades ago. I watched them excel then as I do now, but on Saturday, I saw them both play live for the very first time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 26 matchdays, the Premier League goalscoring leaderboard looks quite familiar. At the top is Mohamed Salah, Liverpool's star winger who is in the midst of what could wind up being the best attacking season in league history, with 25 goals and 16 assists while still in February. Next comes Erling Haaland, who has been able to notch 19 goals despite some injury trouble and Manchester City's whole deal. But third is a bit of a surprise, if only because Newcastle United's Alexander Isak has put it all together to become (depending on how one feels about Haaland) arguably the best striker in the Premier League.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twice already this regular season the website Defector has posted blogs about how the horrid and miserable Philadelphia 76ers might be stabilizing and revving up for a charge up the standings. Ridiculous, foolish, irresponsible blog behavior. No more of this! The 76ers are cooked. A last-second bucket Saturday by Nic Claxton of the aimless Brooklyn Nets sent Philly to its seventh consecutive loss and ninth in 10 games, dropping them to a season-worst 16 games below .500. They now hold the 12th seed in the Eastern Conference, one game in the loss column out of the bottom of the play-in and a whopping 10.5 games from the sixth seed. Do not stop with a single fork: Empty your silverware drawer into a cannon, aim the cannon at their cowering forms, and fire away. It would be a mercy.
It is possible to drop a game to a bad team without necessarily being a very bad team yourself. The 76ers are very bad. Their core was in place Saturday and was roundly outplayed by the various fungible goobers presently filling out Brooklyn's rotation. Tyrese Maxey was his usual heroic self, but Paul George was in Tobias Harris mode, and Joel Embiid was history's saddest statue. Brooklyn led most of the way, and very comfortably through the middle quarters, until a spell of sloppy offense and a Philly rebounding edge allowed the otherwise punchless 76ers back into the game late. Notably, Embiid touched the court not at all in the fourth quarter, which head coach Nick Nurse chalked up unconvincingly to the chemistry of the lineup on the floor. To their credit, the 76ers played with spirit down the stretch, but they needed a pair of missed freebies to stay within a bucket, and the game-winner came on an embarrassingly anticlimactic put-back of what should've been an easy defensive rebound for George.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PITTSBURGH — I was a little surprised by the seriousness of The Andy Warhol Museum. For an artist I associate with playful experimentation, the seven-story building off the northwest bank of the Allegheny is more a tribute to the professionalism, work ethic, and marketing acumen that made Warhol the most recognizable artist of his era—or any that's come since. The layout is tightly chronological, with the four main floors each representing a decade in its patron saint's career. The information presented is devoid of tabloid gossip, keeping Warhol's international fame completely incidental to the narrative of his artistic output. And the only time I laughed out loud was at these deadpan info boxes next to Oxidation, which never break character even as they describe the process of creation through urination, and note ongoing study of the piss painting with a straight-faced "Conservation Challenge."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coaches and managers have a tenuous relationship with the veracity of the spoken word, which is to say that when they speak in public, they are generally either lying or setting up their next lie. Frankness rarely serves them well in any context, which is why they avoid it like a pair of anthrax-infused burlap compression shorts. Everything is a message meant for someone else—to confound or mislead opponents, to placate a dungheaded boss, to motivate a slothful player—and the public exists mostly as a conduit through which that message can find its intended target.
And then there's Ruben Amorim, currently having his pants filled daily with red ants as the coach at Manchester United. He finds his inherited team perpetually irksome and clearly cannot wait for the offseason when he can remake it in his tactical image and likeness. This is not speculation, to be clear. It was obvious from the middle of January, when Amorim said this might be the worst Manchester United team of all time. I mean, that's prime talk show stuff right there, and until United either get better or fire him, it will have a resonance that rivals Bill Parcells' "You are what your record says you are," or Jim Mora's "Playoffs? Playoffs?"]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You shouldn't really watch spring training baseball. Look at it from time to time, sure; let a game lay down a baseline level of low-intensity audio noise in the background by all means. It takes time to remember this, or just the length of one regulation winter to forget it. But as the days got longer and crueler and worse and the start of the baseball season began to feel less abstract if only minimally less distant, I tried to remind myself of this. There was going to be something that looked and sounded acceptably like baseball, and soon, and it was worth looking forward to that. But once it actually got here, I would need to remember not to overindulge. Let it back in, please and thank you, but do it like an IV drip—a little bit at a time, invisibly, to put a little bit of color in your cheeks.
Spring training is longer than it needs to be. It takes time for ballplayers to get back into playing shape, but nothing like the sort of time it took back when ballplayers spent their winters working second jobs or eating big greasy joints of mutton. Players do not arrive at spring training quite so wheezing and gouty anymore, or at least the percentage that arrive slicked in mutton sweat is lower than it was. MLB players stay in shape, they improve over the winter by refining their craft near the homes they own in states that don't have income taxes, or by throwing in front of high-speed cameras and coaches in converted warehouse spaces. But if it does not take a month and a half for contemporary ballplayers to look like ballplayers, it does take a while for the ballgames to look or feel like ballgames.]]></summary>

Then, one day, you found yourself scooped up into a plastic container, tied to a string, and anchored to coral rubble off the Raja Ampat islands of eastern Indonesia. There you must wait until your worst nightmare appears. It might look like a gray spaceship, one dark stripe moving across its body in the gloaming sea. It might look like a leaf, olive green and drifting slowly toward you. It might resemble an innocuous branching coral, arms kinked outward. Or, most mysteriously, it might appear as a whitish specter containing one dark, pulsing inkblot that appears and vanishes as it comes your way. But it does not much matter which of these four (sea)horsemen of your apocalypse heaves onto your horizon, because by the time they have come, it is already too late. You, precious crab, are about to become dinner.
A group of scientists have described the four distinct hunting displays of the broadclub cuttlefish in a paper recently published in the journal Ecology. They also captured video footage of each display—passing-stripe, leaf, branching coral, and pulse—from the perspective of the final moments of a crab (RIP).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The most compelling reasons not to trade Luka Doncic are not the administrative kind, but those reasons exist, too. Weaker-minded decision-makers would have been stopped by more urgent basketball and business considerations having to do with Doncic being a historically good player beloved by the team's fans, and dismissed the urge to deal Doncic as a fleeting call-of-the-void-type impulse. But the Dallas Mavericks' new ownership and GM Nico Harrison were able to see, beneath the jarringly ruddy exterior of the 25-year-old superstar who carried an otherwise unremarkable team to the NBA Finals just last season, a toxic and fast-depreciating asset that needed to be jettisoned 1) immediately and 2) in secret. That trade happened three weeks ago, which turned out to be much more time than was necessary for it to blow up on the Mavericks. Basically no one understands any of it.
And, again, that is just the top-line stuff. The deal itself might not have been anything more than the faulty whim of the team's bummy new ownership, represented in this case by a man who looks like the result of entering "business doll boy (real)" into an AI image generator, and facilitated by a GM with a dangerously advanced case of Contemporary Success Guy brain. It might just be one of those classic deals that instantly immolates a generation or so of fan goodwill and makes a team worse in both the near-term and long-term, made out of spite or boredom or just as the result of a decision-making process that is the result of having contracted some sort of debilitating brain spore from a Mar-a-Lago steam-table entree. This does not make it any easier to parse, to be clear, and also doesn't really explain anything. Also in retrospect that sort of trade is not really one of the classic kind of deals that exist, at least beyond the extent to which the Hindenburg could be said to represent one of the classic kinds of dirigible excursions one could have.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Feb. 13, Sam Nordquist, a Black trans man from Minnesota, was found murdered in a field in upstate New York. He was 24 years old. The ongoing investigation suggests that Nordquist was subjected to prolonged physical and psychological torture for over a month before he was murdered. "No human being should have to endure what Sam endured," Major Kevin Sucher, commander of the state police troop in the region, said during a news conference. The New York State Police has charged seven people with murder.
The majority of the media appears to value Nordquist as a lurid true crime story rather than as a person. Nordquist's death has been widely reported on, with outlets tending to focus on the grisly details of his torture and death that have since emerged in court documents, all of which misgender Nordquist. Only a few queer outlets, such as Autostraddle, have attempted to paint a fuller picture of who Nordquist was as a person—how he spent his days (working at a group home for disabled adults), what he loved (nature, video games, TikTok, Puma sweatshirts, and cooking), and who loved him (his coworkers, his family, his friends, and his two adopted cats, Pumpkin and Storm).]]></summary>

In my inbox was a blurry image of a Tiramisu Cupcake sent by my grandpa, featuring a too-perfect frosting swirl with a thick coating of cocoa powder and a mysterious missing chunk from the cupcake liner that made me think: What kind of monster eats through the cupcake liner? 
Like so many times before, the picture that he sent accompanied a short note: "Can we make this next time you're home?" Usually, I jump at the chance to plan a menu with my grandpa (my grandparents owned a restaurant for over 30 years and in lieu of going to culinary school, I learned how to cook from them). This time though, there was a problem: The post was very obviously AI-generated. When I called to tell him that the cupcake was AI—or "made by a robot," as he said—he had no idea. He has since sent me dozens more AI recipes, despite our conversation.]]></summary>

By rights, it could have, nay, should have lasted past midnight in the east, with every subsequent overtime as high-octane as the first.
Other than that, it could not have been much better as entertainment, as long as you accept the fact that there was an annoying level of contrivance to it. The country that cares most about hockey won, the game's most recognizable player, Connor McDavid, scored the winning goal, the game's disputably best player, Nathan MacKinnon, was named the most valuable player, and the goaltender who stole the show, Jordan Binnington, fully resuscitated the reputation as a big-game player he last enjoyed six years ago.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On a long enough time scale and if the sport is widely popular, a country tends to lose its dominance in a sport it creates. England ceded soccer long ago. The U.S. is, perhaps, in the process of losing its unquestioned position as the supreme basketballing nation. Canada, not for the first time and certainly not the last, faces a reckoning with its place in the hockey world. Since the fall of the U.S.S.R., the top of the sport has become more European, increasingly global, and, above all else, creepingly American. A smaller percentage of NHL players are from Canada than ever before, and more of the best players are from the U.S., as the league has expanded below the border and contracted above it. It's a numbers game, and if it isn't reflected in relative culture cachet, it'll become apparent by who raises the trophies in international competition. Canada may well lose its iron grip on hockey—but not yet.
Team Canada re-expressed its dominion with a 3-2 overtime win over the U.S. in the final of the 4 Nations Face-Off, a totally made-up all-star replacement that almost accidentally stumbled its way into becoming a geopolitical referendum, and served as emphatic notice that the sport is still Canada's to lose. I won't drag out this blog before giving you the climactic goal, the one that'll be replayed for years and years. And because the champions wear red maple leaves, you get the Chris Cuthbert call:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's hard to know whether or not Bayern Munich is particularly good this season. On one hand, they have the best stats in Europe. Die Roten score more domestic goals than anyone in the Old Continent's top-five leagues, and allow among the fewest. Even in the Champions League, where their underwhelming results consigned them to the funky but fun new format's purgatory round, the Germans could point to their competition-best expected goal difference as evidence that their performances have been better than the scoreboards might indicate. And just in terms of pure talent, Bayern doesn't have to look at any other team's roster with envy. By all accounts, this should be one of the best teams in the world.
On the other hand, Bayern's cumulative showings across the season give off a strong whiff of a flat-track bully. Though they consistently hammer their lessers, Bayern's record against more or less equals isn't very good: four draws and no wins against Bayer Leverkusen (twice), Eintracht Frankfurt, and Borussia Dortmund in league play, a loss to Leverkusen that bounced them from the German Cup, and three Champions League defeats to Aston Villa, Barcelona, and Feyenoord by a combined score of 8-1. A 1-0 win over almost-didn't-even-make-it-to-purgatory Paris Saint-Germain and a 5-1 Bundesliga win over FC Lawn Ball Sports are the closest Bayern has come to statement victories this season.]]></summary>

But before we could do that, Rohan asked why it is that we still feel compelled to do the sports talk at all when we could very easily justify doing an entire hour on foods we have enjoyed, with a couple Funbag questions stuck on at the end. It wasn't a gag, or anyway it wasn't just a gag. It's a good question.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thursday morning, the NBA announced that Milwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis would be suspended for 25 games after testing positive for the pain medication tramadol. The Bucks have 29 games left in the regular season, so they will be without a critical player for an extremely important stretch run in which they will have to fight desperately to stay in front of, somehow, the Detroit Pistons. Portis, in turn, will lose $2.8 million in game checks, so everyone involved is screwed—all over what Portis's representatives are calling an accident involving a substance of questionable performance benefit.
As Portis's agent Mark Bartlestein detailed to ESPN's Shams Charania, Portis takes the very similarly named Toradol to manage pain and inflammation from an elbow contusion he picked up at the start of the season, which explains the mixup. "The tramadol pill he took came from an assistant of his, with a valid prescription for the painkiller, which he mistakenly told Bobby was Toradol," said Bartlestein. Portis does not plan to appeal the suspension.]]></summary>

Wembanyama was on court as recently as Sunday's All-Star Game, where he tried pretty hard, at least within the context of that game. The team said that the condition was discovered upon his return to San Antonio. Wembanyama had been feeling "low energy," and that feeling persisted throughout the All-Star break, which prompted the tests that uncovered the blood clot, according to Sam Amick of The Athletic. The Spurs are optimistic he'll return for the 2025-26 season, Tim MacMahon of ESPN reported, citing a team source.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few weeks ago, I was going through the thousand-odd people I follow on one social media site in an effort to ease my transition onto another, when I noticed that I was still following the accounts of several people who were dead. I tabbed over to their pages, knowing I would not see anything profound or overwhelming, merely the mundane thoughts they'd had in 2013, 2017, or 2024, preserved in amber as long as the platform clings to life. The contrast between ephemerality and permanence was jarring. I didn't know whether it felt more respectful to continue following them or let them go.
This precise, hypermodern dissonance is one of the subjects of Jeremy Gordon's forthcoming novel, See Friendship. Gordon's book tells the story of Jacob, a somewhat adrift digital-media drone who needs to create something substantial to keep his career going. Once he learns that a close high school friend named Seth did not die in his sleep as he was told, but under stranger and more tragic circumstances, he decides to create a narrative podcast investigating the death.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The National Court of Spain delivered its verdict today in the trial of former national soccer federation (RFEF) president Luis Rubiales, charged with sexual assault over the unbidden, nonconsensual kiss he planted on the mouth of women's national team star Jenni Hermoso during the medal ceremony after Spain's victory in the 2023 World Cup. Judge José Manuel Fernández-Prieto found Rubiales guilty of the assault charge, but acquitted him of an accompanying charge of coercion concerning his subsequent efforts at pressuring Hermoso into supporting him and downplaying the incident.
Although the prosecution had asked for a prison sentence of one year for the sexual assault charge (and a further 18 months for the coercion), the court opted to impose a fine instead: €20 per day over 18 months, €10,800 in total. Rubiales is also forbidden from contacting Hermoso or coming within 200 meters of her for one year. Also acquitted of coercion were Rubiales's fellow defendants on that charge, former women's national team coach Jorge Vilda and former federation executives Albert Luque and Rubén Rivera.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The “black box” in the title of Shiori Itō’s documentary Black Box Diaries, in which the journalist investigates her own sexual assault, essentially refers to the excuse Japan gives for not properly investigating rape cases. “Because it’s in a black box, we’ll never really know what happened,” is what Itō was told, and as she says in the film, “I think that tells everything about our justice system.” But the black box works as a loose metaphor for another kind of unknowability that permeates the documentary, which was recently nominated for an Academy Award and is made up largely of personal video diaries, sound recordings, and a fly-on-the wall footage of the filmmaker as she investigates her case and ultimately writes a memoir about it (Black Box, 2017). Itō explains a few times that her way of surviving is to wrap herself up in work, to treat her case as a journalist would. But in the midst of this singular focus, the filmmaker in a sense puts herself—that is, Itō the survivor—in a black box. In the midst of this grand investigation, she herself remains unexamined. “I realized I haven’t faced myself,” she says at one point. The tension between the two sides of her—Itō the journalist and Itō the survivor—makes Black Box Diaries a kind of stealth dual narrative, one in which it becomes clear that a guilty verdict is not the end, not even close.
The film starts with a trigger warning, and I will defer to it here. Itō’s documentary opens with cherry blossom petals floating along the water beneath a script warning of the content and offering up how she has dealt with triggers in the past: by closing her eyes, by taking a deep breath. The flowers seem like just a pretty aesthetic choice at first, but by the end of the film you learn that these petals themselves became a trigger for Itō, and only later did she realize it was because the crime took place during cherry blossom season.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What do you get the club that has everything? Trophies provide a buzz, as does dominance over another of the so-called titans of European soccer, but nothing gets the juices flowing more than a brand-new superstar. Soccer is a team sport, but few things can tilt the favor in the direction of one team more than a world-beating attacker. Real Madrid already had one such superstar in Vinícius Junior, but Wednesday's second leg against Manchester City demonstrated why one is never enough for this club and its limitless ambition. These must-win games, in the competition Real Madrid has won more than anyone else, are why the club spent multiple summers courting and, eventually, landing Kylian Mbappé.
