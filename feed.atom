        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is only moderately useful context for one of the drearier sporting events in recent memory that, by his own telling, Mike Tyson nearly died six weeks before his fight with Jake Paul, which finally glitched and lurched and went the whole bleak distance late Friday night, was first scheduled to happen. This was in late May, when what was reported as an ulcer flare-up left Tyson vomiting blood in an airplane bathroom and then in a hospital. "I lost 25 pounds in 11 days," Tyson told New York Magazine. "Every time I went to the bathroom it smelled like tar. Didn't even smell like shit anymore." Tyson told New York that he had "like, eight blood transfusions. The doctor said I lost half my blood." The fight was delayed from late July to mid-November.
It is rude but not really inaccurate to say that Tyson looked like someone who'd had a recent near-death experience, or like someone who had turned 58 back in June, on Friday night. He did and he did, and none of that qualified as a surprise or even really a disappointment. Tyson had retired in 2005 and endured all manner of bad physical and financial health and personal tragedy since; with the exception of two exhibitions, in 2006 and 2020, he hadn't shown any indication that he wanted to fight at all. He was pretty definitive about it after that last loss, to Kevin McBride; "I don't have it anymore," Tyson said then. "I've got the ability to stay in shape, but I don't have the fight and guts...I don't have this in my heart anymore." In the last two decades, Tyson remade his public image and seemingly himself; he has a cannabis brand and a podcast and a meditation practice. He is jarringly earnest, sometimes to kid reporters.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friday night’s rematch win over Amanda Serrano left Katie Taylor with all the titles in the women’s light welterweight division. But it’s hard to call Taylor the undisputed champ, at least for now, what with the disputes over the scorecards in her favor, and all those headbutts.
By the end of another brawl for the ages, Serrano had what looked like a war wound over her right eye, a gash so big it seemed to be smiling for the camera. Serrano seemed to shudder while getting ready for her post-fight ring interview when she looked at a nearby TV monitor and first saw how her face looked. How that injury came about gave this bout its main controversy, and should make for a proper selling point for why these women are gonna have to go at it yet again.]]></summary>

Not Oscar season, but rather that stretch when the halls of streaming services are decked with the brightly lit, thinly disguised advertisements that are the year's new Christmas movies. There are more than 100 new Christmas films to watch this holiday season, and whether that number horrifies or excites you depends upon how much of a freak you are for the festive. Sabrina is proud to say they are a real Christmas freak, and this year they asked some of their colleagues to watch some of the most, uh, available new holiday movies. The first movie in our lineup is Hot Frosty, Netflix's romance between a human woman and a magical snowman with abs.
Sabrina Imbler: I am very grateful to both of you for taking a chance on this idea and watching perhaps the film of the 2024 Christmas movie season: Hot Frosty. Before we get into it, I wanted to ask if each of you could share more about your relationship to Christmas movies, good and bad. Had either of you heard of Hot Frosty before this?]]></summary>

His last film to make a lasting impression was 2007’s Beowulf, an unwieldy but compelling action adaptation of the ancient epic poem that, three years after The Polar Express’s ambitious venture into the uncanny valley, proved that Zemeckis was a filmmaker willing to keep pushing past the bounds of good taste. 3D animation was no longer nascent, but his goal was to blend semi-realistic human characters via motion-capture with the elasticity and graphic creativity of 2D cartoons, somewhere beyond the territory of Looney Tunes and The Incredibles but a few stops short of Gollum in Lord of the Rings. If one were to term this a bet, Zemeckis won. Performance capture animation, from the new Planet of the Apes franchise to Into the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago, as a student at the University of the Ryukyus in in Okinawa, Japan, Ai Takahata was researching the color patterns of a seahorse about the size of a shelled peanut. The pygmy seahorse Hippocampus bargibanti lives only on knobbly, branched corals called gorgonian sea-fans, where its own, equally lumpish body is perfectly camouflaged. When Takahata cut off a branch of the seahorse's coral, a handful of worms spilled out.
She brought the worms to Chloé Julie Loïs Fourreau, a graduate student in the same lab at the university, who studies worms. "At that time I didn’t even know about this species and wasn’t looking for them," Fourreau wrote in an email. But when Fourreau looked into the literature, she identified them as Haplosyllis anthogorgicola, a species of polychaete worm that was first described in 1956 and then never recorded again. The researchers had unwittingly rediscovered a long-lost species of a tiny, nearly transparent worm about as long as a green lentil. Their paper on this rediscovery, "The Trojan seahorse," was published recently in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.]]></summary>

In less dark moments, that contestation feels like just about the only form hope can take. The language still exists. Maybe someone will need it, someday, to accomplish some good in the world, while the world still exists. If that's ever to be possible, then our language has to retain some usefulness, too. It has to be tended.
"Trump Picks R.F.K. Jr. to be Head of Health and Human Services Dept.," reads the New York Times headline from Thursday, atop a story by health policy reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg about, well, pretty much what the headline says. We're fine up to that point. Then there's the subhed (emphasis mine): "Whether the Senate would confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic who has unorthodox views about medicine, is an open question." That formulation repeats in the lead paragraph (emphasis again mine):]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because Philadelphia sports fans are the irradiated mutants they are, a win by the local team is not necessarily the central point of the exercise. If you’re wondering why the Eagles fan in your life seems grumpy and sour this morning even in victory—that is to say, slightly more hungover but otherwise normal—know that it is mostly because they are an Eagles fan, and also because they are fuming that Saquon Barkley did such yeoman's work in saving Jake Elliott's job.
Oh, they'll open any conversation, whether you asked or not, with their pleasure at the Eagles beating Washington, 26-18, grabbing the NFC East race by its saggy eyelids, and covering the 4.5 en route. But if they bet the over, they will be fuming in their own charmingly unintelligible way about the seven gettable points that Elliott, the team's veteran placekicker, could not deliver. And in a division race that now almost surely belongs to the Iggles, those little things count—not some knobhead’s bet, but the worry that your kicker might screw you in real time in December, or worse, January.]]></summary>

If we're doing Major League Baseball at Major League Prices in minor league settings, let's not half-ass this. Let's really go for it.
The Rays announced yesterday that their 2025 home will be Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, the spring training home of baseball's reigning anti-Rays, the New York Yankees; in keeping with America's exciting new approach to the redistribution of wealth, the Rays will be paying the Yankees $15 million in rent for the privilege. For big league teams, that amount of money is a rounding error, but as a metaphor—with the poverty-unravaged Yankees getting more financial oomph in their pursuit of Juan Soto while the Rays scramble to re-up Jose Siri—it is exquisite. One team lives the newly-in-vogue shameless patrician's life while the other barely gets by on a diet of Montgomery Biscuits and Charleston River Dogs, with the former extracting rent from the latter. It's one American pastime embedded in another.]]></summary>

People are still doing it and sometimes wrecking their lives in the process. The gambling concerns that sit atop the industry are propping up what's left of sports media with their advertising expenditures, and bending coverage toward their own cheesy ends. A government that only grudgingly restrains predatory industries like this one, under the best of circumstances, is not remotely under the best of circumstances. None of this appears to be going anywhere, but it is also not getting any less repellent. Sounds like podcast stuff to me!]]></summary>

When he was drafted 16th overall this past spring, many snickered that a little guy who paints his nails and is famous foremost for his TikToks would be playing in Philadelphia, on the theory that he would be a weird cultural fit in a city whose citizenry prides itself on eating rocks and loving pain. That line of thinking misses a key thing that McCain has in him, which is: That Dog. McCain is a hooper's hooper, and the main aspect of McCain's game that has struck me through the serious hot stretch he's enjoying, aside from the discrete basketball skills he's showing off, is his ironclad mentality. He's operating like he's the best player on the court at all times, which I think is as important for young players adjusting to NBA speed as hitting open shots or making rotations. To belong, you have to believe you belong, and if there's one thing that makes me optimistic McCain will stick, it's his confidence.]]></summary>

You’re in a casino. It’s early in the morning, but it could be any time of day. There are no clocks here. No windows, either. Surrounding you is nothing but the strangely cheery hum of the casino that occupies the main floor of this hotel: bright and colorful screens, verdant felt gaming tables, cartoonish bloops and farts emanating from all of the machines, even the ones not being used. The playlist is solid but also relentless, following you anywhere you walk. You’re one of the few people here right now, but the ambience of the casino doesn’t make it feel that way. The place feels alive, even though it’s only artificially so. Fake life will have to do for now. It’s early and you haven’t had your coffee yet, so you’re not ready to confront reality yet anyway.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disgraced former NFL coach Jon Gruden has spent the last few years desperately trying to return to his craft. Gruden lost his head coaching job with the Las Vegas Raiders in 2021, after emails in which he used racist, homophobic, and sexist language were leaked to the press. In one of those emails, he wrote that "Dumboriss Smith has lips the size of michellin tires," in reference to then-NFLPA head DeMaurice Smith. Gruden resigned from his position with the Raiders in October 2021, and then popped up the following year, sporting a Mark Davis-lite haircut, to half-heartedly apologize for the things he wrote.
That didn't do the trick, so Gruden has spent the last two years coming up with other ideas. He managed to weasel his way into the Kansas City Chiefs' training camp this past summer, but that didn't lead to any jobs. Then he sat down for a profile with CBS Sports in September, in which he revealed that his new goal was to get a job coaching college football. Still, no coaching opportunities materialized, which left Gruden stranded with one final option: content creation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What exactly is the Utah Hockey Club? I can give you the obvious answers: They're an NHL team playing its first season in Salt Lake City; they're the reanimated corpse of the Arizona Coyotes; they're a company that still hasn't settled on an name for its product. But none of those mean a whole lot in the context of actually watching a game. To fans of other teams, their presence on the schedule remains abstract and unfamiliar—detached from any memories of past experiences. For those in Utah, they're by definition your team, but you don't really know the players yet, haven't gotten used to the rhythm of week-by-week hot and cold streaks. It's like living with a new roommate; you may be open-minded and even optimistic, but there's a lot of blank space left to fill.
The Carolina Hurricanes do not have this issue. As they've made the playoffs in six straight years under head coach Rod Brind'Amour, they've established one of the firmest identities in the NHL. With longtime players like Sebastian Aho, Marty Nečas, Andrei Svechnikov, Jordan Staal, and Jaccob Slavin, you know exactly what you're getting when you play the Canes: a team that will do everything they can to maximize shot differential and win by out-possessing their opponents. Utah got the quintessential Canes experience at home on Wednesday night, getting outshot 50-21. But with a statement-making third period that began with fireworks and ended safely in Karel Vejmelka's glove, they picked up an unlikely and inspiring 4-1 win.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The hits keep coming for Premier League referee and self-proclaimed Liverpool hater David Coote. After the leak of a video showing Coote, possibly if not definitely zooted out of his mind, disparaging Liverpool and Jürgen Klopp, a new video, published by the often unsavory and sometimes downright evil tabloid The Sun, reportedly shows the now-suspended Coote snorting a white powder of some sort—wink wink—while on duty at Euro 2024 this past summer in Germany.
According to Sky Sports, the English soccer referee association (PGMOL for short) is aware of the new video and said in a statement that they are taking the allegations "very seriously." The spokesperson for the PGMOL goes on to say that "David's welfare continues to be of utmost importance to us, and we are committed to providing him with the ongoing necessary support he needs through this period."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For me, seeing a screen in a theater is like seeing a bank logo at Pride. We don’t need that here! This space is about living, breathing, three-dimensional people. And I’m not just talking about the tiny cell-phone screens that light up in the rows around me—though, obviously, put those away. I mean when a Broadway production devotes a chunk of its stage to images of the actors instead of the actors themselves. When I go to the theater, I like to feel myself disappear into the production, and a screen is inherently distancing—a copy of the real thing. Every once in a while, like in Ivo Van Hove’s production of Network, the presence of a screen makes diegetic sense. But mostly, like in Ivo Van Hove’s production of West Side Story, the staging makes you wonder if you should have just gone to an IMAX theater instead—a place where person-to-person empathy is supposed to be subsumed by spectacle. But if any production can make an argument for these screens as experience-enhancers rather than mere shiny toys, it’s Sunset Blvd., the new staging of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, which feels like the trendiest thing to see on Broadway this holiday season.
When the 23-foot LCD screen swung down from the ceiling to magnify Tom Francis’s harried face in the show’s early going, I was a little bit relieved, against my traditionalist instincts. You see, I had one of the worst seats in the house at the St. James Theatre—any farther away and I’d be watching The Hills Of California across the street. And because I was so high up, and could see no details whatsoever of anyone’s face, I appreciated the Jumbotron-esque assistance provided by the compact camera rig Francis held in front of him. But as it kept returning, I was confronted by the inevitable question: Do you look at the real thing, or the larger-than-life thing? It was only at the start of the second act, when that decision was made for the audience, that I could embrace the full extent of the possibility that the Broadway camera offered.]]></summary>
