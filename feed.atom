        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The challenge of pitching is to stay unknowable—to keep hitters guessing, to never be timed up or figured out. By the end of the Tigers-Guardians American League Divisional Series, which featured a considerable number of relief innings even by the standards of postseason baseball, it did feel like these teams, who had met 13 times already in the regular season, were each becoming quite familiar with the other. The resulting sights could be something unfamiliar to fans: Detroit’s Beau Brieske, who hadn’t given up a home run off his fastball all season, serving up a go-ahead meatball to David Fry in Game 4; unhittable Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase allowing one less earned run in this series than he had all year. The threat of overexposure made each game feel extra tense. “It was such a fun series,” Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt said after Game 5 on Saturday, a 7-3 Guardians win. “Two very evenly matched teams going at it, and it was a lot of fun.” 
Though Cleveland’s path to the postseason wasn’t as bizarre as Detroit’s—the Guardians took first place in the division in mid-April and never relinquished it, despite scares from the Twins and Royals—they were both teams depending on run prevention. The Guardians offense cooled off in the second half, but the team stayed afloat thanks to an elite homegrown bullpen. An early-season injury to ace Shane Bieber, plus some underperformance from young arms, left the Guardians rotation in roughly the same [shrug emoji] shape as the Tigers’ heading into the postseason.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought the card in May of 2022. It was one of my many low-dollar purchases on eBay, made during one of my manic buying phrases; those tend to happen when I’m in a particularly good or particularly bad mood. “Stop buying things,” my wife will say when, say, a UK demo cassette of the song “Your Woman” by White Town arrives at the house. And I will reply, “But I’m in one of my manic buying phases when I am in a particularly good or particularly bad mood!” Eventually I toss the item in a box and forget about it, and then I try to remember to work on things in therapy and maybe ask for a medication tweak.
Anyway, this particular purchase was her fault for once. She was the one who told me about the card. Jan usually experiences sports vicariously through me, but she is a baseball fan. Our third date featured a long discussion about Bobby Estalella and whether he was the worst player named in the Mitchell Report. (Feel free to discuss in the comments.) So she knows a bit about sports cards. And one of the reasons we love each other so much is that she, like me, has a brain full of esoteric knowledge that could never, ever be useful in any scenario. Sometimes she tells me something wonderful and I just kiss her.]]></summary>

My eyes followed the precise lines that crossed each other again and again, each on its own predetermined path but also existing as a component of the whole. Humble straight lines drawn in pencil or crayon, multiplied to such a dizzying degree that when you stand back, they blend together into a wiggling mass that comes into and out of focus like an optical illusion. I wanted to run my fingers over the lines; I imagined I would be able to feel the ridges they made in the wall, the way my handwriting does in my notebooks. 
It was the last day of summer, and I was visiting Mass MoCA for the first time with a group of my former coworkers. It’s been seven years since we all worked together, and in that time our relationships have cohered more into a family. There were 10 of us there that day, plus two babies, so once we started looking at the art, we broke up into groups based on our pace, interests, and whether we had a toddler to chase.]]></summary>

This is because humans tend to get better at things through repetition. You give me enough chances to learn and refine the doing of something, even something that involves wires and buttons and so forth, and I am going to be way better at the thing after a few decades at it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is difficult, even the morning after, to know how to view the Los Angeles Dodgers' 8-0 shutout of San Diego in Game 4 of the National League Division Series. Was it an homage to the power of desperation? The triumph of an efficient system over individual excellence? Plain dumb luck replayed eight times in succession?
However you assign motive, let alone value, the Dodgers performed the rarest of feats on Wednesday night when they tied up their series on the strength of an eight-pitcher shutout. Rarer still, only one of those eight, Alex Vesia, faced more than five Padres hitters. Vesia was stretched out over the fourth and fifth innings in a 30-pitch marathon that had oldey-timey rememberers sighing over the recent death of Luis Tiant, the wonderfully idiosyncratic pitcher who threw a 155-pitch complete game in the 1975 World Series, three days after pitching a complete game shutout, all at age 34 and while celebrating every win with a cigar the length and girth of an adult spaniel. But that was then. This is the very opposite of that.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2019, the photographer Harris Narainen had just wrapped up a night dive off Anilao in the Philippines and begun his staggered ascent to the surface when his dive leader pointed a flashlight at something bright and yellow. Narainen looked over and saw a tiny shelled octopus called an argonaut, or paper nautilus, clinging to the candy wrapper as if it were a magic carpet. "I was just too excited," Narainen wrote in an email. Earlier, the dive leader had mentioned they might see argonauts if they were lucky, and now here one was, sailing into the bright beam of light.
Although most octopuses live near the ocean floor and its ample hiding places, argonauts spend their entire lives sailing in the open ocean, just below the surface. This lifestyle has rendered the small cephalopods rather elusive to the scientists who wish to study them. "Most observations on argonauts are opportunistic," Roger Villanueva, a marine biologist at Spain's Institute of Marine Sciences, wrote in an email. In many of these serendipitous observations, argonauts are spotted clinging to some kind of substrate, such as a twig of driftwood or some gelatinous creature. But a traditional sampling net cannot capture these associations; the turbulence of retrieval will separate an argonaut from its trusty steed or entangle it randomly with another.]]></summary>

It'd be obvious how the NL MVP would go in any coming-of-age movie worth its salt: Shohei Ohtani humbly breaks off a piece of his tiara to give to Francisco Lindor, because he can't bring himself to soak up the entirety of the recognition for himself.
Lindor's all-around success at the plate and at shortstop this season had earned him an undisputed spot as the National League's second-most valuable player well before Wednesday. And if it wasn't already, his place in the hearts of Mets fans was cemented by the skin-saving sockdolager he levitated in the ninth inning in Atlanta to deliver New York a playoff berth on the day after the so-called last day of the season. But I don't know if anything he's done in his career so far can match his cathartic triumph near the end of one of the most excruciating innings in recent playoff memory—one that allowed the Mets to knock out the Phillies and earn a trip to the NLCS.]]></summary>

Second-half Ranger Suárez, not to be confused with first-half Ranger Suárez, loaded the bases with one out in the first, and escaped without a scratch. One inning later, he did the same thing again. So it didn't feel like the Phillies' luck had run out in the sixth inning, when the bullpen loaded the bases with Francisco Lindor up, so much as it felt like inevitability. What did you honestly think was going to happen but a grand slam?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the Minnesota Lynx blew out the Connecticut Sun in Game 5 of the WNBA semifinals Tuesday, they looked like they had spent years gelling together. They were the better team on both ends of the floor. Part of that can be chalked up to the simple existence of Napheesa Collier, who put up her third consecutive game of at least 25 points and 10 rebounds, a WNBA postseason record, and could probably turn a quartet of traffic cones into a sound basketball team.
But the Lynx have been a treat to watch precisely because they're not a one-woman show. Instead, they are insistent on a harmonious style of hoop, heavy on ball movement. Watching them skate past the Sun, 88-77, and rejoice with the traditional post-victory Electric Slide, it was hard to believe a team this cohesive was still so new: Only five players on this Lynx team returned from the roster last season, and of those five, only three have meaningfully figured in this playoff run. This team was assembled in free agency and on the trading block by Cheryl Reeve and her double-duty as head coach and president of basketball ops. Tuesday's elimination game was specifically a showcase for the Lynx's most critical offseason signing: veteran guard Courtney Williams, who had 24 points, seven assists, and five rebounds.]]></summary>

Most of the remaining franchises have a little flower they can offer to the neutrals, something that says Hey, wouldn't you like to see these sweeties succeed? As best I can tell, their claims are as follows:
The Mets are rallying behind absurdist lucky charms like a purple blob and a pumpkin
The "gritty Tigs" keep manufacturing clutch hits right when they need them
The Phillies are basically the Himbo Brigade
The Dodgers lead off with the best-liked man in the sport, making his playoff debut
The Guardians have exceeded all expectations with a rookie manager who's not afraid to cry
The Royals are playing against the Yankees]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been an especially dramatic edition of Fat Bear Week, the annual fan-voted competition to crown the brown bear at Alaska's Katmai National Park who packed on the most poundage ahead of winter hibernation. You may remember last week's horrors, when the start of voting was delayed by the inexplicable killing of Bear 402 by "Digger." Neither of those bears had qualified for the knockout round of the competition, but if you read down in the story, you noticed one who has: "Chunk," last year's runner-up. Chunk was spotted stealing 402's carcass from Digger, presumably to cache it as food. Cannibalism is not, we understand, specifically prohibited in the Fat Bear Week rulebook.
But Chunk has his own history, and infamy. He is biggest bear on the river, clocking in at over 1,200 pounds. He fell in the finals in 2023 to "Grazer," a 19-year-old blonde female bear who pulled off the upset in fan voting. If only that were the only history between the two when they met for a finals rematch this year. This was a revenge game—for Grazer.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jill Ellis wore a smile in June of 2021 when she appeared in a press release photo announcing the new San Diego NWSL club, and her as its president. The former U.S. Women's National Team coach who led the team to back-to-back World Cup wins—making the United States one of just four countries in the competition’s men’s and women’s history to successfully defend a title—wore sunglasses and all black with a striking cream coat as she strolled along a sandy beach. Days later, the team posted a sit-down interview with Ellis in which she said the team’s ownership "really wanted to do something special on the female landscape and create an environment where it’s run by females." At a press event, Ellis said the Wave would stand as "not simply as a football club, but as a platform for those who dare to dream."
This week, five former Wave employees—all women—filed a lawsuit against both the Wave and the NWSL in San Diego Superior Court. The lawsuit asserts 15 claims, including disability discrimination, racial discrimination, sexual harassment, failure to investigate and prevent discrimination and harassment, retaliation, wrongful termination, and retaliating for engaging in protected activity. Overall, it portrays the Wave in stark contrast to the club’s marketing as a sports team that would be more than just a sports team and with a highly accomplished woman in charge.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the slow-motion car crash that was the end of the Golden Bachelor, I was prepared for the first season of its sister show to flop. I watched most of Gerry Turner's journey to find love with tears in my eyes, and as Alex Sujong Laughlin wrote at the time, the new entry into the Bachelor pantheon offered "a refreshing break from the onslaught of cheap trauma the franchise has been churning out the last few years." That joy was short-lived, as it tends to be in the Bachelor universe.
One day before the season finale, The Hollywood Reporter published a story titled "The Golden Bachelor's Not-So-Golden Past." In the grand scheme of Bachelor scandals, Turner's was rather tame; there were no allegations of antebellum cosplay or sexual abuse. The most dramatic revelations were about the two women Turner had dated since the death of his wife. As THR noted, "He was single and a widower, after all, not cheating. But his amorous activity certainly didn’t align with how he regularly yanked viewers’ heartstrings with on-air announcements about his lack of a love life since his wife died."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If the return of the NHL has felt like it's slipping under the radar a bit—not for you, of course; you've studied Lauren's preview like it's the Dead Sea Scrolls—blame it on the season's soft launch. Is it truly an Opening Day if there are five separate opening days depending on the team? Some clubs won't play their first meaningful hockey until Friday, a full week after the lads were getting after it in Prague. It doesn't help that many of the games so far, including those Czechia games and Tuesday night's tripleheader, have involved teams that still sound a little fake to me: the "Utah Hockey Club," the "Seattle Kraken," the "Buffalo Sabres."
But it is real, regular-season action, and I come bearing video to prove it. The Utah Hockey Fellas are, of course, the old Arizona Coyotes in everything but name. (It's all the same players, but the history and intellectual property still belong to Alex Meruelo, at least until 2029. Those Coyotes also own the history of the original Winnipeg Jets, not to be confused with the current Winnipeg Jets, who own the history of the Atlanta Thrashers. Aren't sports fun?) So this is not an expansion roster—despite the temporary lack of a name, and the tenancy in a building that after a hasty first round of renovations only holds about 11,000 for hockey—and won't be dogshit, or at least no more dogshit than the Coyotes were. This is a real, big-boy hockey team, and Salt Lake City fans, who turned out in strong numbers to buy season tickets, were ready to welcome them. In their first game, hosting the Blackhawks (who are dogshit), Dylan Guenther made sure the fans didn't have to wait longer than five minutes.]]></summary>
