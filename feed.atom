        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps like their shooting percentage, the harmony and good vibes of the Vancouver Canucks were due for regression this year. Still clinging to the second Western Conference wild card spot but with a tough remaining schedule and a new batch of injuries, the Canucks are neither good enough to contend (as they were last year) nor bad enough to write off (as they were for several years before that). The on-ice product is such a slog that the only entertainment the team now provides is in the form of a purported rift between their two top centers, Elias Pettersson and J.T. Miller.
The simplest version of this story goes that Pettersson is passive and disengaged while Miller is intense and abrasive to the point of bullying, and because of this, they do not get along. “Petey and my relationship has come a long way. We're still working at it. We're completely different people, you know what I mean?” Miller told Sportsnet's Iain MacIntyre last February. If you’re at all familiar with hockey media’s latent Don Cherry mindset, you can guess that they tend to read the Swedish Pettersson as aloof and effete, while J.T. Miller, who gets caught swearing on the on-ice microphone roughly 15 times a season, plays his foil, the classic American red-ass who cares a lot.]]></summary>

The permanently aggrieved Heat forward has been especially aggrieved this season after the team didn't offer him an extension on his big honking contract this past summer, so despite the Heat actually playing some decent basketball, he's done with them.
The shape of this superstar trade demand mostly adheres to the standards of the form, but things could get weird in the month remaining between now and the trading deadline. These are the Miami Heat and Jimmy Butler we're talking about here, two forces whose stubbornness is only matched by their performance of obstinance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The South Eastern Conference has not had a good go of it in this year's bowl season. The conference reached a low point during last night's Sugar Bowl, in which Georgia was pantsed by Notre Dame. It was an odd thing, watching this Notre Dame team that lost to NIU cruise to a 23-10 victory while looking bigger and stronger than their SEC powerhouse opponents.
You can argue that Georgia played better than the score indicates, even while starting QB Gunner Stockton. Stockton was fine, throwing for 234 yards and one touchdown while outplaying his counterpart, Riley Leonard, who threw for just 90 yards a touchdown. The game was decided in the margins, with Georgia losing two fumbles at critical points and Notre Dame beginning the second half with a 98-yard kick return for a touchdown. Georgia was out-coached, out-schemed, and much of their season's sloppiness finally came back to bite them. Maybe their rookie QB was a deficit, but I would ask anyone making that argument to go watch some Carson Beck tape from this year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who threw the glass in the street, man? That query has echoed in my head ever since I saw D.A. Pennebaker's 1967 documentary Don't Look Back, which captured in cinéma vérité the overwhelming attention that followed Bob Dylan to England in '65, while he was still a solo acoustic act on stage. The documentary crystallizes what is probably the most commonly shared cultural image we have of Dylan: a skinny dude with sunglasses and messy hair and disordered energy, speaking in snide riddles, beset by clueless questions from square reporters.

The lowest seed in the field is going to end up as a touchdown favorite over the highest seed remaining, three of the four semifinalists are big, name-brand schools that can be found less than 500 miles from each other, and every remaining team is a traditional powerhouse. 
In other words, in its first attempt at a proper tournament, this most baronial of sports got the only things it ever wants, which is an emphatic reinforcement of its regional roots (plus those outworlders from Austin) and the return of Notre Dame. The rest of you can piss right off.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2018, the orca Tahlequah, or J35, made headlines for her tour of grief, in which she carried the dead body of her calf for 17 days. The baby, which lived only for half an hour, was female. At the time, she marked the first successful birth in Tahlequah's pod, known as the J Pod, in three years. A baby orca can weigh as much as 300 pounds. But each time the body slid off her snout, Tahlequah dove to retrieve it. Tahlequah swam with her dead calf for at least 1,000 miles before she dropped her body, which had begun to decompose. Many people considered Tahlequah's behavior a display of grief, although some researchers had reservations. (Spoiler: I personally find the most logical explanation to be grief.) 
In late December 2024, Tahlequah gave birth to another calf, which would have been her third baby to survive, in addition to the 13-year-old Notch, or J47, and the 3-year-old Phoenix, or J57, both male. Tahlequah's new calf, J61, was female, which would have been a boon for the struggling population of southern residents, a culturally distinct population of orcas in the Pacific Northwest that includes J, K, and L pods. On Dec. 24, the Center for Whale Research expressed concern about the health of the calf, which was likely born prematurely. "J35 is an experienced mother, and we hope that she is able to keep J61 alive through these difficult early days," the Center posted on Facebook.]]></summary>

No one plans on becoming a morning person. We all have morning people in our lives, and they tend to be an unappealing lot. They openly (proudly!) declare themselves to be morning people, almost as a warning to others. They can’t wait to start their day with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind, so that they get on with the process of 21st century self-optimization: Waking up at 3:00 a.m., doing 900 crunches before breakfast, updating multiple life goal spreadsheets, making every call while on speakerphone while on a Peloton, and drinking oddly colored protein shakes for “body fuel” every other hour. Real Marky Mark shit. Teenage you would vomit in horror at the idea of ever morphing into this sort of creature.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Charlotte Hornets are puke. By win percentage they are one of the three or four worst teams in basketball, but unlike their fellow losers, the Hornets sincerely believe they have some significant part of their core of the future already in place, which is sad enough that if I think about it for very long I will cry. The Chicago Bulls aren't quite puke, but they'd be better off if they were. Instead, they are the very textbook case of NBA mediocrity, a dreary irrelevant also-ran made up of mismatched bozos hoping to play their ways individually into trades to anyplace else, except Charlotte. The six-win Washington Wizards are currently 3–1 against these two bumbling outfits; it's a real dog-food buffet down in the lower half of the Eastern Conference.
Both teams shoot a lot of three-pointers. My abacus tells me there are worse ways to lose a basketball game, but there are not many that are uglier. The Bulls have had a better time with bombing away: Per Cleaning the Glass, they've outperformed their expected record by about two wins, a taste of good fortune which accounts entirely for their hold on middling-hood despite being one of the handful of worst defensive teams out there. The Hornets are bad at shooting and even worse at picking their shots—you'd have to watch a couple of their games to appreciate how blindly and recklessly their "best" players chuck crap only vaguely basketward—and as a consequence they have the third worst offense by points per possession in the NBA.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Texas Longhorns defeated the Arizona State Sun Devils, 39-31, in a double-overtime thriller to advance to the semifinals of the 12-team college football playoff. After the Longhorns got out to a quick 14-0 lead in the first quarter, the Sun Devils clawed their way back, slowly but surely, before closing the fourth quarter with 16 straight points. A pair of missed field goals by Texas certainly helped the comeback.
ASU quarterback Sam Leavitt threw for 222 yards, completing 24-of-46 passes, along with an ill-timed interception to end the second OT. On the other side, Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers threw for 322 yards and accounted for three TDs and one interception. But the player of the game was easily ASU running back Cam Skattebo, whose toughness and gladiator effort nearly won the game. He rushed for 143 yards and two TDs, and caught eight passes for another 99 yards. He even threw a 42-yard touchdown pass for good measure.]]></summary>
