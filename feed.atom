        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Becca Beckham grew up around the South in a military family. Beckham's family moved every two to four years, and she grew up, she says, with public service in her heart. "The military really shaped my family, and I appreciate everything that it's done," she said. "But I knew in my heart that that is not the path that I wanted to take." 
Beckham always knew she wanted to experience more of the United States. In college, she became interested in the Peace Corps, and then AmeriCorps—the federal agency that organizes community service across the nation. "It's this vague, big thing that a lot of people have heard of, but they're not necessarily sure what it does," Beckham said. AmeriCorps, envisioned as the national version of the Peace Corps, was created in 1993 under President Bill Clinton. The agency offers people opportunities to serve communities across the U.S., addressing needs such as education, disaster response, and public health. Beckham joined an AmeriCorps program that led a team of 10 people around the nation for a year, working on disaster relief efforts in Missouri, Colorado, Texas, Alabama, and New York.]]></summary>

Thanks to this pair, Florida is heading to the Stanley Cup Final for the third straight year. And they've made it this far looking just as tough, nasty, and talented—if not even more so.
Hurricanes fans couldn't have had much hope after their team went down three games to none, but the next four periods of hockey might have shown them, briefly, a glimmer of light. There was the shutout win on Monday to start, and then on Wednesday, Sebastian Aho managed to beat Sergei Bobrovsky twice in the first period for a 2-0 lead. That early advantage wasn't enough, though. Florida hit them with three goals in the middle of the second period, and after Seth Jarvis struck back to tie it for the home team in the third, Verhaeghe silenced the Carolina crowd for the summer.]]></summary>

"And that's OKC's challenge tonight, because Minnesota is playing for their season." There was a quality of pleading in Breen's face: A certain matte non-twinkle in the eyes, a tendency of the outer points of features to turn down. He was a man grappling with an expression, actively managing his mouth shapes and struggling to etch something delight-ish into the available margins. Perhaps you are thinking this is an artifact of botox. That is not your damn business!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The other day, bemoaning the state of his WNBA fantasy team bench, my colleague Jasper mentioned that he’d just picked up a player he’d never heard of: someone named "K. Westbeld," with no photo. This was more or less how the real Phoenix Mercury conducted their offseason business. The team has not owned its first-round pick in five straight drafts. To construct the new “big three” of Kahleah Copper, Alyssa Thomas and Satou Sabally, Phoenix dealt away virtually every other rotation role player they had. Basketball teams tend to have more than three players on them. So began an offseason scrounge through the photoless. 
But don’t judge a player by her lack of photo! Two weeks into the WNBA season, the Mercury are one of the most fun teams to watch, in large part thanks to international scouting finds the average WNBA fan had not heard of before now. In Kathryn Westbeld—and fellow new signings Monique Akoa Makani, Kitija Laksa and Lexi Held—the Mercury have some real role-player gems. They defend, pass, shoot, and generally make good decisions. At home against the Sky on Tuesday, they led the team to a 94-89 win after trailing by 16 in the third. An incredible fourth quarter saw Laksa, Akoa Makani and Westbeld combine for six threes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the nervous peloton began their long, slow ascent up out of the Adda River valley to Bormio to finish Stage 17 of the Giro d'Italia, I thought Isaac Del Toro was cooked. The 21-year-old Mexican rider had put up an admirable fight for the first 16 stages of the Giro, and though he'd clung on to the maglia rosa leader's jersey longer than anyone expected he'd be able to, third weeks of Grand Tours are unforgiving, especially for a young rider who has never faced the pressure of defending a leader's jersey before. 
One day earlier, Del Toro cracked on the San Valentino, losing over 90 seconds to the hardened Richard Carapaz and the moderately hardened Simon Yates; one climb earlier, Carapaz and Yates made him quiver. It stood to reason that Del Toro's infirmity would compound, and the veterans would do him the courtesy of easing the pain of carrying the jersey. Instead, he seized the initiative and smoked everyone to win his first Grand Tour stage in style.]]></summary>

But, otherwise, it has been a voyage of discovery. I knew Anthony Edwards because my friend Tom Crean had recruited him at Georgia, but Jaden McDaniels was a complete mystery to me.

Whenever something routine for a pro athlete happens to the Indiana Fever's star, Brennan's job is to turn it into a matter of existential concern for the WNBA, a league that has 12 other teams. This week's news provided another opportunity. Crisis alert: Caitlin Clark has strained her quad. Can women's basketball as a whole possibly soldier on?
The tone of Brennan's latest column might mislead the reader into thinking that Caitlin Clark has died. In reality, the Fever guard is only sidelined for at least a couple of weeks; after Tuesday's practice she was casually putting up three-pointers.

The inane thoughts that make their way from Trump's obviously diminished mind onto his Playskool social media platform should not demand the attention of any right-thinking Americans, and yet in this case the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) snapped to attention, rewriting its qualification rules in an attempt to appease those behind what's become a national hate campaign directed at a 16-year-old high school student.
The student Trump was referring to in his post is named AB Hernandez. She is set to compete in the high jump, triple jump, and long jump at the state championships, and she has spent the past few months being harassed by a local group of bigots. This group is led by Sonja Shaw and Jessica Tapia, both members of the Save Girls Sports association. Shaw is currently running for California superintendent of public instruction, and Tapia was recently fired from her teaching position at Hernandez's high school for refusing to respect trans and nonbinary students' pronouns. At a qualification meet earlier this month, Tapia and Shaw led a group that spent hours heckling and harassing Hernandez as she competed.]]></summary>

Unfortunately, it seems like Ellen’s mom-nemesis, Hazel, has no intention of playing by the rules. Would it be moral to just let Hazel get away with that?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The pattern was: The New York Knicks would scramble the length of the floor in desperation—frantic, wide-eyed, bolts rattling loose, spotting passing and dribbling lanes just as they snapped shut—in search of a bucket. When they got one, it scanned most credibly as an accident. Then, whether the Knicks got one or not, the Indiana Pacers would breeze unimpeded the other way and Tyrese Haliburton would create a wide-open, high-value shot for himself or somebody else within seven seconds. That pattern leads where anybody would expect it to go. The Pacers won Game 4 of the Eastern conference final Tuesday night, 130–121, and now lead the series three games to one.
When the Pacers wasted any tightly distributed handful of the approximately infinite good looks they enjoyed on the night, the Knicks could hang around, aided by 39 free-throw attempts and an unaccountable second-quarter stretch in which they wiped away a 10-point deficit and took a one-point lead with Delon Wright on the floor and Jalen Brunson off it. (Wright found time to commit a double-dribble violation in there, and played a shade under two minutes in the second half.) But the Pacers never relented so long that they couldn't just breeze back out to a multi-possession lead with 90 seconds of focus once they locked back in. Haliburton in particular delivered what's probably, given the circumstances, the best game of his career so far: 32 points, 15 assists, 12 rebounds, four steals, and not a single turnover, despite doing the vast bulk of Indiana's ball-handling and creating over his 38 minutes. Even as his shooting cooled off after a bonkers first quarter, he maintained Indiana's lunatic pace, kept the buzzsaw whirring, and sectioned New York's defense to toothpicks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let us approach Shohei Ohtani as naively as possible, while admitting that in the case of Ohtani this decision can hardly be anything but a ruse. For the span of time that he has been on the Los Angeles Dodgers, Ohtani has been a designated hitter, and a very good one: He won the MVP last year in spite of being a designated hitter, and this year has been, depending on how you count, either the second- or third-best offensive player in MLB. The best is Aaron Judge, who is doing Aaron Judge things; the other second- or third-best player is, naturally, Ohtani's teammate Freddie Freeman; Ohtani currently has both of them, as well as every other player in MLB, beat on home run tally.
Here is what that looks like over the course of a long weekend. The Dodgers came into it in a bit of a mire: a four-game loss streak, followed by a three-game win streak, followed in turn by another loss. Then their designated hitter opened up the final game of their series against the New York Mets by doing this:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Florida Panthers, as terrifying a hockey team as they are, have made a bit of a habit out of elongating their playoff series. Take their slow start in Toronto last round, or the three they lost while up 3-0 to the Oilers last Stanley Cup Final. In all likelihood, their shutout loss on Monday night will be just another snooze button. But after a trio of wins in the Eastern Conference Final where the Panthers used the Hurricanes like a bonfire does newspaper, the Canes earned at least one victory to hang their helmets on. If nothing else from this series goes Carolina's way—and so far, it hasn't—they'll at least have the excellent stretch of hockey that eventually delivered the game-winner in Game 4.
This action was tense until a pair of empty-netters carried the Hurricanes to a 3-0 final. But Carolina did a spectacular job limiting the defending champions' chances on net. Keeping the ice tilted has been the team's personal path to victory year after year, but against the fury, physicality, and plain old talent of Florida, the Canes shrunk into something unrecognizable as they lost three games by a combined score of 16-4. Here, however, the team out-efforted the Pants, particularly from the midpoint of the first period through a Carolina penalty late in the second. In that time, Florida produced absolutely nothing of note on offense and relied on Sergei Bobrovsky to be tidy in goal. At 0-0 with the clincher in sight, Florida might still have felt fairly comfortable, but it was Logan Stankoven who ensured that his Hurricanes' momentum would not go wasted.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At some point near the start of the fourth quarter of Game 4 of the Western Conference Final, in which the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 128-126, a thought occurred to me: These teams are playing too hard. It just didn't seem possible that an NBA game could withstand that much sustained frenzy and focus from its participants. I had a vision of several players suddenly collapsing on the floor, all of their mental and physical energy spent. I saw the fans in the arena becoming nauseous, unable to safely metabolize the potency of the basketball that was unfolding before them. Adam Silver was going to rush the court and put a stop to everything. No, no, you can't do this, he'd shout. You're going to ruin the rest of the games.
Monday's game was unquestionably the best we've had so far in these playoffs. That's an achievement in and of itself, considering how inert this series felt after the first two games, in which the Thunder seemingly established themselves as several classes above their opponent. But Minnesota caught Oklahoma City with all sorts of haymakers in Game 3, winning that one by 42, and so they came into Game 4 at the very least convinced that they could stand and trade. What resulted from that belief meeting the Thunder's resolve to avenge the embarrassment of Game 3 was a game that reached and stayed at the highest levels of intensity for 48 minutes.]]></summary>

She beamed when she met Ellie the Elephant at Liberty training camp last month. She and Breanna Stewart laughed it up on Cloud’s Instagram stories during a recent team excursion to Yankee Stadium. After New York’s home opener against the Aces, the crowd cheered at the sight of Cloud’s happy face on the jumbotron; she finished with 22 points, six rebounds and nine assists.
And can you blame her for smiling through it all, in disbelief of her life? The trade that sent her from Phoenix to Connecticut in exchange for Alyssa Thomas this past February scrambled the 33-year-old point guard’s plans. “I just want to be in an organization that truly invests from top to bottom: facilities, team, location, all of that. I want to compete for championships,” she said after the trade, which definitely stood in the way of all that. But then came a second trade, the biggest glamor upgrade she could hope for. Shuffled from a middle-of-the-pack Mercury team to a tanking Sun team to the defending champion Liberty, Cloud was so over and so back in the span of two months.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Knockout-tournament soccer is the best soccer because of how it amplifies the sport's essence. The magic of the game lies in the tension between unpredictability and mastery. On one foot, the game is so difficult, so low-scoring, and played over such a relatively short timespan, that in 90 minutes truly anyone can beat anyone. On the other, the best players and teams are so good at dictating the encounter's terms and appearing in the match's few critical moments with touches of brilliance, that the outcome is rescued from a randomness that might render it meaningless and becomes imbued with real significance. The knockout tournament heightens both sides of this tension. Teams that reach the final do so by proving their ability to conquer entropy, but they only achieve glory by winning one last game, where anything can happen.
On Saturday, Arsenal pulled off a monumental upset by defeating Barcelona in the Women's Champions League final. While this doesn't make the Gunners necessarily the best team, it does I think make them the perfect winners of the club game's best competition.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a general rule, you do not want to know what sportswriters are eating. Assume that it's happening at strange times and in strange ways. Some of this is due to the specific pressures of the job; some of it is just because sportswriters are strange. Sportswriters, on balance, are probably not as strange about food as the people that talk about sports on TV—Jim Nantz orders his toast briquette style; Ian Eagle claims that he has never "ingested" a condiment; Michael Kay once said he had never tried coffee or soup, and didn't eat an egg until he was 62 years old—but sportswriters do not get paid as much, either. Just know that there are a lot of finicky habits in this industry. (Not me, though. I am normal.)
In one sense, the strangest thing about the grocery run that New York Post baseball columnist Jon Heyman posted on Twitter on Thursday is that the order itself is not very strange at all. It's the sort of stuff that a sportswriter might enjoy while writing about sports: a big container of blueberries, popcorn (unpopped), Diet Coke, and cashews. Surely Heyman has peers whose last grocery receipts are far more unsettling. But think about the items above, and how much you would pay for them at the store. Would it be nearly $50? Would you be so upset about how close it is to $50 that you post about it online?]]></summary>

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump sat down for a public meeting with Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa. Perched on an armchair in the Oval Office, with the White House's newly installed gold-tone decorations stuck to the mantlepiece behind him, Trump declared that Ramaphosa is "a man certainly in some circles really respected, other circles a little bit less respected, like all of us."]]></summary>

At an emergency meeting of the Camogie Association held last night in Dublin to quell increasingly loud protests, delegates repealed an antiquated rule that prohibited players of the ancient Gaelic game from wearing shorts, as their male counterparts always could. The vote was one-sided: The Camogie Association said after the meeting that 98 percent of the delegates at its hastily called Croke Park summit voted to do away with the misogynistic mandate immediately.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a pleasing symmetry to the Mission: Impossible brand cycle: 30 years between the 1966 debut of the original CBS television series created by Bruce Geller to the 1996 cinematic reboot starring Tom Cruise, and again between that first film and what would appear to be the final installment of the franchise this summer with Mission: Impossible–The Final Reckoning. A childhood favorite of Cruise’s, the original show is, for anyone tempted to look back, a portal to an era of American television that was willing to be goofy. Still, Mission: Impossible was always a heist series at heart. Inspired by the 1964 film Topkapi, which features a team of thieves attempting to steal from the titular palace of Sultan Mahmud I, Mission: Impossible the show melded the heist plot with obligatory espionage elements at a time when James Bond and Get Smart followed similar trends. 
By now, almost no one thinks of the television series, so wholly has the film franchise and its zealous lead actor taken over the past three decades, weathering seachange after seachange in the already turbulent, risky landscape of Hollywood. Behind it all, of course, is Cruise himself, who began Mission: Impossible as the first project for the now-defunct Cruise/Wagner Productions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On April 7, the New Yorker and Time ran nearly identical stories that might be better described as press releases for the de-extinction company Colossal Biosciences. The two stories differed slightly: the New Yorker's headline proclaimed "The Dire Wolf Is Back," whereas Time's announced "The Return of the Dire Wolf." While the New Yorker led with a photo of a cub, Time led with a photo of a fully grown wolf. But the effect of these stories was the same, both creating the impression that the dire wolf is indeed back after 10,000 years of extinction.
What these stories seemed less interested in was the fact that the dire wolf was, in fact, not at all back, nor will it return anytime soon. Colossal is a company that runs on PR stunts, and the latest hoopla instigated a wave of criticism from scientists seeking to set the record straight: The "dire wolf" on the cover of these glossy magazines was not a dire wolf, meaning an individual of the extinct canine species Aenocyon dirus. Instead, the "dire wolf" was a modern wolf with 20 genetic edits, none of which involved the splicing of actual dire wolf DNA. "It’s not a dire wolf. It’s misleading to call it that," Vincent Lynch, an evolutionary biologist at the University at Buffalo, told Chemical and Engineering News. “I can't explain how pissed off it made me, because they're still saying this stuff, and they know it to not be true.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It can be hard to tell when it is safe to officially declare a bad baseball team a historically bad one. You usually kind of know it when you see it, but passing certain mile markers allows you to affirmatively point the finger and declare: These men belong in the piss pot of history.
One such signpost arrives when words like "worst" and "since" start popping up alongside years that start with 18. The Colorado Rockies hit that point on Thursday night, after losing 2-0 to the Philadelphia Phillies to push their season record to 8-42. The Rockies are now sole owners of the worst 50-game start in baseball's modern era. You have to go all the way back to the 1895 Louisville Colonels, who started 7-43, to find a team that performed worse through its first 50 games. This team is squarely on the path trodden by the 2024 White Sox, who spent a good chunk of that campaign threatening to break the 1899 Cleveland Spiders' record for most losses in a season (134), but ultimately had to settle for the modern-era record (121). The Rockies are currently on pace to blow past the White Sox and pip the Spiders with 136 losses.]]></summary>

Whatever. It does not matter that the Eagles have won two Super Bowls in eight seasons.

You should hate him! Every Philly sports fan thinks they could do a better job owning the teams they hate and care about than the people that currently own them. I myself have so many ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Paul Maurice was hired out of retirement to heal the Florida Panthers' multitude of competitive leprosies, he was called in some corners "the enemy of fun." This happened because of the way he likes to play—simple, direct, minimizing open-ice flair, and emphasizing all things heavy. He is not a brutish tactician, but he recognized, without ever having the CV to prove it, that winning in April, May, and June requires a devotion to power, persistence, and crowd control in front of the net that hockey’s regular season dilettantes never seem to fully grasp.
But, and we're being fair here, Paul Maurice is indeed also the enemy of fun. We can say this because the Panthers' Eastern Conference Final series against the Carolina Hurricanes is already deeply and profoundly un-fun, in the classic only-one-team-is-getting-its-way way. Beating the 'Canes on Thursday night by the frankly rude score of 5-0 was lopsided enough, but other than an offside call that negated Carolina's only real chance of the night, that score was actually a kindness. Put another way, through the first 40 minutes, the only two differences between the 'Canes and Angel Reese were a) there were 17 more of them than her, and b) she got off more shots.]]></summary>

This week, we were joined by Jason Steinhauer, the historian behind the History Club newsletter and the bestseller History, Disrupted, to discuss those questions, and the historical and cultural forces that created them, and to start working toward some answers.

They will feel sadness and pain and disappointment many times during their years on Earth, just like you and I, but unlike you and I they will maintain access to all the blessings that money and talent and beauty bring them. For the most part, we only ever get to see them in the latter state, and it's easy to conclude that all that good stuff they have makes their lives invariably better than ours on a day-to-day basis.
Sports can be an equalizer in this regard. Think about how bad the days after your worst moments as a sports fan felt. Every time my favorite team gets eliminated from the playoffs, I end up going through the next day in a sickly daze, feeling much like I did the morning after the 2016 election. This is not rational, but it is what being a sports fan does to my brain. Now imagine how much more intense that awful feeling is hitting Knicks fans today, hours after they witnessed their team cough up a playoff game in unthinkable fashion.]]></summary>

Nevertheless, at the end of 90 painful minutes, there was a light at the end of this sewage pipe of a match: For the first time since 2008, Tottenham won a trophy.

Not long before, he complains to the narrator about readers: “People talking about a book as if it were just another thing, like a dish, or a product like an electronic device or a pair of shoes, to be rated for customer satisfaction—that was just the goddamn trouble.” Students submit papers that say, “I hate Joyce, he’s so full of himself.” Online reviewers imply, “if a book didn’t affirm what the reader already felt—what they could identify with, what they could relate to—the author had no business writing the book at all.” The famous author quits teaching, quits writing. The state of the novel, its place in the world, is too depressing.
“But hasn’t it always been this way?” asks the narrator.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made a fateful decision ahead of the Eastern Conference Finals. I think it was Sunday. The night before, the New York Knicks had finished off the defending champion Boston Celtics. The Indiana Pacers were already waiting around, having thrashed the East's top seed in five games. It took me into Sunday to go huh, Pacers-Knicks. Do I care about that? I considered this deeply, the way one might ponder a puppy in a pet-shop window. Am I prepared to give my heart to this stupid thing? I decided, yes, I would buy the puppy. I activated the button inside my brain that allows for a feeling of cheesedness to adhere to a matchup between these two specific franchises, in a conference final, in 2025.
You see, I am old enough to remember a little thing we used to call the 1990s. The Knicks and Pacers were good teams then, back when making the playoffs used to mean something. There was a stretch, starting in 1993, when these two teams eliminated each other six times in eight years. Do not look up how many titles they combined to win over this period! The point is that a great deal of animosity built up between them, and many goofy narratives blossomed from the rivalry, and the whole era kicked ass. These teams played to Game 7s in 1994 and 1995 (and again last year), and met in consecutive conference finals in 1999 and 2000. Reggie Miller became a folk hero; guys like Dale Davis, Charles Smith, and Travis Best were pressed temporarily but firmly into mainstream basketball discourse. John Starks brushed perilously close to bozodom. Yes, I am now openly pandering to readers of my generation, but such is my prerogative. Basketball was aesthetically better in 1997! No one can stop me! Ha ha!]]></summary>

Buehler was put on the IL with a shoulder injury on May 2; the inflammation cleared up fast enough that he was activated Tuesday morning without any rehab assignment. Cora’s absence was even briefer: To the ire of one Boston talk radio guy, Cora missed Monday’s game to attend his daughter’s college graduation.
“It’s not like they need him there to make the pitching change or lay down the bunt. It’s the leadership and optics of the whole thing,” 98.5 The Sports Hub host Michael Felger said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ten NFL teams voted against banning the Tush Push today, leaving the Philadelphia Eagles free to convert short-yardage plays at will. Somewhere inside of a Tilted Kilt, a freshly extended Nick Sirianni busts out his finest shit-eating grin in exultation.
As befitting the play itself, the Eagles had to grind this one out. The Tush Push was in grave danger of being outlawed two months ago when the Green Bay Packers had seemingly amassed a quorum of votes (24 were needed) to get their No Butt Stuff proposal approved at the NFL owners meetings. At the time, Packers coach Matt LaFleur derided the Tush Push as being too “rugby”-ish to belong in football (American football has its origins in rugby). The organization also considered the play a safety risk (competition committee chairman Rich McKay said there was no statistical evidence that the play is more dangerous than any other) and caused “pace of play” issues (uh, OK). No sane person bought any of those arguments. Whether the Packers were acting on their own behalf or at the nudging of commissioner Roger Goodell, who is rumored to abhor the Tush Push, the intent was always transparent: We can’t keep letting the Eagles get away with this. Given what I know about the Eagles and their fans, that’s normally a sentiment I’m down with. But not this time.]]></summary>

With this in mind, we can again say one of the best-loved and certainly most frequently repeated sentences in contemporary baseball: Rich Hill is BACK!
His generic name aside, Rich Hill has been eased out of more throwing-related major league jobs than anyone this side of Josh Johnson, though in fairness this is Hill’s 24th year in professional baseball, and he is 45 years old. But when he signed a minor league deal with the injury-ravaged Kansas City Royals, it just felt right. When he pitched his first game for the Royals' Arizona Complex League team yesterday against the Chicago Cubs' representatives, it went swimmingly—four innings, 12 hitters, 12 outs, seven strikeouts. There is more work to be done, but go ahead and say it: Rich Hill is totally BACK!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The saddest stories in local news are the ones where the body has been left to sit for a while. I worked in local news for the first decade of my journalism career, and that often meant writing about people who died. Sometimes people died after a long and glorious life; all too often, they died far too young, and in easily avoidable tragedies. But every now and then a news release would come across my desk from local law enforcement asking for help identifying a body that they had found, and along with it a slew of horrible questions: How long had this person been dead? Did anyone notice they were gone? Death comes for all of us, but not all deaths are equal. Some are more cruel than others.
I remembered that feeling Tuesday, when news broke that the Chicago Sun-Times and The Philadelphia Inquirer had both published a special section—HEAT INDEX Your Best of Summer Guide—whose recommended summer reading list included a bunch of made-up books by real authors, the names and titles thrown together seemingly at random. It got worse from there. When reporters from 404 Media and later The Atlantic contacted the person who wrote the summer book list, he explained that he wrote it—or, anyway, put it together—using ChatGPT, and then had just forgotten to double check the work before submitting it to the company that had commissioned it, King Features, a division of newspaper publisher Hearst. The words, seemingly still unread by anyone who'd notice or care that they were mostly nonsense, then got shoveled along. Hearst packaged the words, then licensed the section to various newspapers, which duly printed it out and included it in their Sunday editions. If anyone did notice the many mistakes along the way, they sure didn't stop them. No surprise, a lot of writers and readers got very mad about this online.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spike Lee didn't invent the floating dolly shot, but he did make it his signature move. It's not just in his repeated use of the technique, but rather in his understanding of its storytelling potential. In Mo' Better Blues, the dolly shot captured Bleek's obsession with his trumpet and how it mirrored the devotion he brought to sex with his two girlfriends. In Clockers, the dolly showed how Strike's lifestyle of selling drugs, running from the cops, and being accused of a murder was destroying him both physically and mentally. In 25th Hour, the dolly captured both Mary's drunken euphoria as a young woman at a party as well as Jacob's out-of-body experience after abdicating responsibility for a moment. Spike uses the dolly to help him imbue his characters with depth, psychology, and conflict without uttering a word. In other hands, the dolly is often deployed at significant moments, or sometimes at seemingly mundane ones just to add some visual flair. Rarely does a Spike joint use the dolly as the definitive moment of his work. In fact, as far as I can remember there is only one Spike Lee movie in which the entirety of the film builds up to one particular dolly shot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a sequence in the first quarter of Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals where the Oklahoma City Thunder used a drive-and-kick and a swing pass to get the ball to versatile young noodleman Chet Holmgren, who'd floated to a whiteboard-perfect shooting position out above the break. Naz Reid of the visiting Timberwolves hastened to close out on Holmgren, who is a danger from deep. Holmgren showed a decent enough pump-fake to cause Reid to overcommit, and then darted to his right for a straight-line drive to the cup. Chasing a ball-handler from 27 feet is a tall ask for a big man, and here Reid was cleanly beaten. Holmgren's handles are certainly adequate to this task, and anyway all he needs is one dribble to get from the arc to a controlled one-foot gather. The last man back was Donte DiVincenzo, and DiVincenzo was late. This looked like a dunk.
Reid is quicker than Holmgren, and his movement patterns are more recognizably humanoid, so he was never far from the play. As Holmgren gathered for take-off, Reid sprinted on an intercepting path and used his chest to deflect Holmgren off of the runway. The impact slowed Holmgren's momentum—Holmgren still has the physique of someone who needs to speed-eat 100,000 beef sandwiches—which allowed Reid to make a reasonably controlled contest of what became a stalled, off-balance layup. The ball rimmed out, the Timberwolves gathered the defensive rebound, and the action flowed the other way.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mets are in a chumpy way at the moment. They have scored 10 runs in their last six games and have just one home run over that stretch. If you look at this from the perspective of wanting the Mets to score runs, that is annoying, but it is also probably not very important. Even very good teams will phase in and out of chump mode over the course of a long season, because that is the nature of the baseball season and also the nature of baseball. This doesn't make it less annoying when it happens to a team you care about, and sometimes teams that are expected to be good really do turn out not to be. But because this sort of thing is so inextricably a part of baseball, there's nothing to do but figure out how to discern what's noise and what isn't, and then get to work ignoring everything that deserves to be ignored.
For instance: the Los Angeles Dodgers have allowed 32 runs in their last 36 innings, which covers a four-game losing streak during which they were swept in a three-game series at Dodger Stadium, by the Angels; in a loss on Monday night, they swung at 42 of Diamondbacks starter Brandon Pfaadt's 93 pitches, didn't miss any of them, and had a .000 batting average on balls in play. They have 29 wins, a .604 winning percentage, and are in first place in the National League West. They have real problems—a number of starting pitchers with a number of variously severe or worryingly vague injuries, most notably—but they are not bad. It would be reasonable for a fan to get mad, watching this highly credentialed team blast one Brandon Pfaadt pitch after another directly at a waiting Diamondback fielder. Anything more than that would be ... well, no one gets into being a fan of a baseball team to be reasonable. But it would be excessive.]]></summary>

Popular music wasn’t immune to this cultural puritanism.

Before long, readers began noticing something strange about the "Summer reading list for 2025" section of the insert. Namely, that while the list includes some very well-known authors, most of the books listed in it do not exist.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tottenham Hotspur has lost 21 times this season and sits 17th in the Premier League table—unimaginable for a club of its size and resources. While attempting to play the progressive attacking game mandated by their second-season manager Ange Postecoglou—an enigmatic style known as Angeball—Spurs’ players have often looked like they have forgotten, and possibly never knew, how to pass at all. Against Chelsea in April, Tottenham's own fans chanted "you don't know what you're doing" at the manager. For months, the pundits have screeched a common refrain: "Why hasn’t Ange been fired already?"
And on Wednesday, when Tottenham plays Manchester United in the Europa League final, Ange has a chance to salvage it all. A win would be the club’s first trophy in 17 years, its first European trophy since 1984, and would spell a return to the Champions League. It’s a ridiculous situation made even more so by the manager’s early-season reference to his track record: at every team he’s ever managed for multiple years—Australian clubs South Melbourne and Brisbane Roar, the Australian national team, Japan’s Yokohama F. Marinos, and Scotland’s Celtic—he’s won something in his second year. To the last few hardcore Angeball defenders still out there among Spurs fandom, myself among them, it would be sweet redemption.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the NBA conference finals matchups set, the most interesting narrative question of these playoffs has been answered. Would the veteran-laden squads who'd done it before triumph again, or would the new generation put their elders out to pasture? The second round was a clear referendum in favor of the zoomer uprising, with the last three champions—the Boston Celtics, Denver Nuggets, and Golden State Warriors—getting eliminated. 
When the confetti falls a month from now, the seventh different champion in as many years will hoist the trophy. The four remaining teams have won one title between them—two if you feel that the 1979 Seattle SuperSonics title travels (the Oklahoma City Thunder themselves don't wear the gold patch)—and that one was over 50 years ago. Something new is going to happen.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 74th minute of Angel City’s May 9 game against the Utah Royals, Angel City defender Savy King collapsed on the field. She was immediately tended to by medical staff, who performed chest compressions. Once she was stable, she was carted off the field and transported to a hospital by ambulance. Other players appeared emotional during the stoppage of play. Ten minutes after King collapsed, the match continued. 
After the game finally ended, players hugged and cried. Utah player Alex Loera, who was teammates with King last year at Bay FC, led the teams in a prayer circle. Shortly after that, Christen Press was interviewed on the broadcast. She had scored her first goal of the season—it was a signature Press how’d you make that ball move like that? shot—just a few minutes before King collapsed. But her focus wasn’t on the win at all. “I think this game has been very emotional, very tough. All of us are praying for Savy, our teammate. … She is on our hearts and minds and that’s really all I can think about right now,” Press said. “It was a really, really emotional game.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[METRO DETROIT — It’s early Sunday evening on the last weekend of April, and I’m perched beside a currently-out-of-use lane in a dimly lit section of Thunderbowl Lanes in Allen Park, Mich. On this particular weekend, Thunderbowl was the site of the Professional Bowlers Association’s Battle of the Brands, and after a raucous finale, the hubbub has subsided. The crew members are switching off the bright lights that illuminated the lanes for TV. Pro bowlers quietly weave in and out of the event zone to collect their ball bags. Most of the adoring fans who packed the stands have headed home. A few remain, eagerly waiting along the edge of barricaded lanes with signs and jerseys, hoping for a parting memory with their bowling heroes. Then there is my mother, sunken into the bleachers, heart heavy with history as she takes in the scene. But we’ll get back to that.
My gaze wanders across the massive bowling center—in modern-day bowling parlance, bowling alley is out, and bowling center is in. Thunderbowl Lanes is a curious convergence of future and past. The laneside computers are up-to-date, the screens work, the place is clean and more than equipped to host events like Battle of the Brands. But the carpet has a busy retro pattern, the bartop tables whisper echoes of the 70s, and the lettering out front eschews modern minimalism for a nostalgic chunky design.]]></summary>
