Carrying the ball up the field 10 minutes into Tuesday's deciding leg of the Barcelona-Benfica Champions League tie, Lamine picked up his head, saw Raphinha opening up his stride, and lifted his hand in contrition.
The gesture communicated that he appreciated the Brazilian forward's run, which presented the duo a great chance for another one of the thunderbolts they've spent all season tossing back and forth to each other, but as he hadn't read the play quickly enough and wasn't prepared to hit the pass before its window of opportunity closed, the Spaniard couldn't reward his teammate's effort with the pass the moment called for. Coming from the talent it came from, implicit in this apology was another sentiment: "Don't worry, I'll make up for it."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cooper Flagg has been conceived of as the surefire top overall pick in this June's NBA Draft since he reclassified two years ago, and despite taking on the enormous pressure of getting into the draft sooner, Flagg has only strengthened his case this year. Around him in the lottery, Rutgers' Dylan Harper has been doing a convincing Ethical James Harden bit; Baylor's VJ Edgecombe has been making all the Draft hardcores I read flush in awe; and Harper's teammate Ace Bailey has finally learned to pass the basketball, showing both an awareness of other people lacking through the first three months of the season and the capacity to grow and change. Nothing that cohort, nor anyone else in college or international basketball, has done has been as impressive as what Flagg's been doing at Duke. Not only has he produced at a staggering level, he's playing tomorrow's basketball, today.
With hopefully just a few more games left in his college career, and with the stinky end of the NBA content to befoul the court now that the trade deadline has passed and its members can lose in peace, it is time to consider where Flagg could end up. Also, more to the point, where he should end up. Not every team in the lottery is as worthy, by my arbitrary standards, of capturing the Flagg. The NBA Draft's structure not only limits how much money Flagg can make for many years, the draft lottery means he has zero control over where he will work for the majority of the next decade. Such is life in the NBA, under the current Collective Bargaining Agreement. Some players walk the blessed path and end up in a great city and on a great roster, and others are drafted by the Sacramento Kings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last time the San Francisco 49ers had the kind of crisis of faith they’re currently enduring, they wrote it off as a weird emanation from COVID. Back then, they went from ending a season with a Super Bowl loss to Patrick Mahomes to enduring one of double-digit losses, mostly because the bulk of their offensive playmakers were gone for some portion of the season and  their defense slipped from elite to meh, bordering on feh. That relative patience was rewarded with a bounce-back season in 2021 and a trip to the conference final, a double-down season in 2022 and another trip to the conference final, and finally another run of excellence in 2023 that ended with...losing another Super Bowl to Patrick Mahomes.
History has a way of repeating itself, especially where losing to Patrick Mahomes is concerned, but the 49ers do not seem to believe that this cycle is going to make another revolution. Last year was another injury-plagued season that saw the Niners go from double-digit wins to double-digit losses. This time, Kyle Shanahan, who runs the building with full acquiescence from the fully satisfied York family, has seemingly decided that the windows are not only closed but need full replacement and double-paning. At least we think that's what he decided. For the first time in his eight-plus years in charge, he might not actually be in charge.]]></summary>

They might as well have erected a ginormous flag and one of those balloon men that flop around, because the South Lawn is a car dealership now. Maybe they could have unfurled a sign that read "Deals Deals Deals!"
Except there were no deals. Instead, there was a line of five Teslas looking like shiny garbage. The reason behind this is simple: Elon Musk is now the president's big boy best friend, and Elon Musk has four jobs (Twitter, SpaceX, destroying the government illegally, and Tesla). His fourth job, Tesla, is the one he seems the most sensitive about, probably because it's the only one that had even a slight chance of success. Instead, Tesla stock has been dropping since mid-December, because many Americans have realized that Elon Musk is a goon.]]></summary>

This is a question I have found myself asking, more often than is good for me, about Bari Weiss's suddenly large and well-monied media company, which according to the New York Times Magazine has more than three dozen full-time employees and at least 100,000 paying subscribers. I recently went to the homepage, scanned the day's meager offering of bone-dry headlines—highlights: "How I Became A Wife" and "Things Worth Remembering: Money Can Ruin Your Life"—and there was the question again: Who is getting fired up to read this crap?
It's a question that has become easier to answer in recent days and weeks. Over the weekend, pro-Palestine activist and Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil was detained by the Department of Homeland Security and disappeared to a detention facility in Louisiana without being charged with a crime. As a set of facts—a campus activist was arrested by the federal government over speech acts—this is a story that should have been red meat for Weiss and The Free Press. Weiss essentially built her career by positioning herself as one of the few people brave enough to ring the alarm bell about the rise of anti-speech illiberalism on college campuses and in broader society. It's something she and her cohort never really shut up about, in fact. And yet, so far, The Free Press has published one article about Khalil's arrest, which reads as a wholly dispassionate rundown of the facts of the case and cedes its point of view to the Some people say this is good, while others say it is bad framing that was long ago perfected by The New York Times:]]></summary>

Down three points with just under four seconds to play, the Pacers used a timeout to move the ball into the front court, but then positioned the inbounder's four teammates in the backcourt, in a spread formation not unlike what you'd see before a Hail Mary pass in football.

Initially, the Big Four, discovered by Galileo, and then as optics and astronomy advanced, more and more, smaller and smaller bodies, until Big J could proudly boast of 95 moons in its orbital thrall. But Jupiter got cocky. Jupiter rested on its laurels. Jupiter, it turns out, was playing against plumbers and mailmen when it put up its record numbers. 
Saturn, meanwhile, was hungry. Saturn ate the tape and put in the hours in the gym. In 2020, astronomers discovered 20 new Saturnian moons. In 2023, they racked up 62 more. This week, the International Astronomical Union formally recognized a whopping 128 further new satellites, giving Saturn a total of 274 moons, a record that will surely never be broken (in this solar system, which as we all know is the galaxy's top-tier league). Saturn has more moons than it knows what to do with! It has more moons than the rest of the planets combined! Jupiter can attempt to dry its tears with its pathetic 95 Jovian moons, which compared to mighty Saturn might as well be no moons at all. Jupiter? More like Venus!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On April 29, 1970, Dave DeBusschere of the New York Knicks hit a jump shot from the circle with three seconds left to give his team a 102-100 lead over the Los Angeles Lakers in the third game of the NBA Finals. LA’s Wilt Chamberlain inbounded the ball immediately to guard Jerry West. His first dribble was a feint to the left. West then cut back toward the middle of the court and let fly from 60 feet, over, I think, Dick Barnett . (The video looks like it was shot underwater on Mars.) On the video of the shot, the sound in the arena almost cuts out entirely until the ball goes through the net to force overtime—at the end of which, I would point out, the Lakers lost anyway.
It is probably as iconic a basket as was ever scored in the NBA, not only because it was scored by a certifiable NBA legend, but also because the shot was … a shot. It was not a heave. It was not a “desperation toss,” as Gene Hackman warned his Hickory Huskers against in the Sectional Finals against Linton. It was not some kind of baseball pass aimed roughly at the area code in which the basket is located. There was nothing freaky about it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With just about three-quarters of the Premier League season done and dusted, there's little drama on either extreme of the table. At the bottom, barring a collapse from one of the not-quite-relegation-fodder teams, the recently promoted trio of Ipswich Town, Leicester City, and Southampton will be yo-yoing back down to the Championship. Meanwhile, at the top, Arsenal's 1-1 draw against Manchester United on Sunday means Liverpool now sits on a surely insurmountable 15-point lead in what can't even really be called a title "race" anymore.
This doesn't mean the Premier League is devoid of drama, though, and in fact there is one fight in the standings that looks certain to go to the very last round. I'm referring here to the race for the third, fourth, and fifth spots on the table, all of which should give Champions League qualification for next season. A quick explanation for why there will likely be five rather than the usual four continental places for the Prem: the Champions League's new format grants an additional entry spot to the league with the highest coefficient on an annual basis, and this year the top dogs are practically a lock to be the English.]]></summary>

Just check out these clips from midway through the game, right after the Sens broke the 0-0 tie. Linus Ullmark, a goalie who's been shaky but ultimately an asset in his first year with the club, whipped the house into a frenzy with a showcase of quick reflexes and lucky breaks. I especially love the flying fist in the crowd that breaks the camera's sight line after the second clearance. You can imagine the person it's attached to shouting "Yes! Hahaha! Yes!"]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are the obvious reasons to cheer against a Duke basketball team, but for a long time, I’ve had my own special justification: Before she took a job as head coach of a program at the bottom of the ACC, Kara Lawson was a first-rate color commentator, and I selfishly wanted her back on my TV talking hoops. A mutual parting of ways, a sudden change of heart—anything would do! The private-school elites couldn’t get away with blocking access to a public resource for their own gain. 
It turns out private-school elites can and do get away with that, a lot. The Kara Lawson For All movement suffered a blow at this past weekend’s ACC Tournament. On Sunday, as she celebrated the Duke women’s first conference championship since 2013, Lawson reflected on a long journey. The pandemic cut short her first year at Duke—the team decided to suspend the 2020-21 season after four games—and in subsequent seasons, the Blue Devils struggled in a tough conference. “Five years later,” Lawson said in her postgame interview. “We’re at the top.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sam Darnold has a reassuring habit of overperforming when expectations are nonexistent. That was a trait that came in handy for him in the role of bridge quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings in 2024, and he’ll have to bank on it again now that the Seattle Seahawks have inked him to a three-year deal in the Baker Mayfield range of pay. If you’re a fan of the Seahawks, you’re probably not all that excited by this move. In fact, you might very well be stumped, if not apoplectic. You might be like WELL FUCK A DUCK WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT?
This is somewhat understandable. Darnold crapped out as a No. 3 overall pick by the Jets before heading to Minnesota last season and waging one of the more unlikely Pro Bowl campaigns in league history, throwing for 35 TDs and more than 4,000 yards as the Vikings went a gaudy 14-3. Darnold even beat these same Seahawks, in Seattle, with a big-boy TD pass to Justin Jefferson in the waning minutes. In the rain. On a busted leg. It was enough to make you wonder if Darnold, and not rookie J.J. McCarthy, was the answer at QB that Minnesota fans had been waiting for. And if you weren’t a Vikings fan, you could at least drool over the prospect of your team landing this man in free agency. If you told a Seahawks fan after that Minnesota loss that they were getting THAT Darnold, they’d be psyched.]]></summary>

Ahead of Sunday night's third-round match, I thought that the world No. 379 Watanuki, a qualifier, would beat No. 17 Frances Tiafoe. It wasn't quite as spicy a prediction as it might appear. Watanuki had been playing well since he qualified for the tournament, and I was unconvinced by Tiafoe's shaky round-of-64 win over qualifier Damir Dzumhur. There was also one small but relevant fact: Watanuki was currently working on a trial basis with Tiafoe's former coach, Wayne Ferreira, who must have alerted his new player to his old player's soft spots. Watanuki had played mind-melting tennis in the only prior meeting between these two, at the 2023 Miami Open, which Tiafoe narrowly won. History said it was a pretty good matchup for the underdog.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One month ago, Demi Vollering held her first press conference as a rider for FDJ-Suez and insisted that her season was not about revenge. Vollering, arguably the peloton's best rider, had spent four increasingly antagonistic seasons with SD Worx, inarguably the peloton's best team, so no matter what she says, everyone involved in last year's Tour de France Femmes debacle is necessarily going to be in conflict with each other. This presents a fascinating dynamic; this past weekend, it made for some fantastic racing.
Vollering claimed her second Strade Bianche on Saturday, destroying Anna van der Breggen on the run into Siena's Piazza del Campo and winning by 18 seconds. The men's race was fun, though all it taught us is that Tadej Pogacar is truly blessed by God; the women's race showed that Vollering versus her old team is going to be fun as hell to watch all year, and that Vollering might have the upper hand. FDJ was incredible, setting the pace alongside Jumbo with such authority that not even an obviously doomed breakaway was allowed to form (maybe they learned their lesson after the disaster at Omloop). Vollering's fellow FDJ newcomer Juliette Labous was tremendous in keeping her team leader at the front of the race and eventually helping her take part in what would turn out to be the winning move. When van der Breggen attacked just ahead of a foreboding 18-percent gradient, Vollering was fresh enough to follow her countrywoman, then destroy her on the famed run-up into town.]]></summary>

At the start of a final period that saw Dallas nab a trio of goals to force Edmonton to white-knuckle a 5-4 win, the Stars' latest pickup comfortably one-timed a cross-ice feed from Matt Duchene. That play showed the kind of offensive skill that any Cup hopeful would love to add, even for a hefty bundle of picks.

Not that it's badly written—as constructed by Evan Drellich of The Athletic, it's perfectly understandable. What gives it that special feeling of traumatic brain injury is the idea that Rob Manfred, or any commissioner, would pressure any owner to do anything, ever. That's just not what commissioners do, because the first law of capitalist relationships is in force here: "Those who pay the salary give orders to those who receive it." And since the argument into which Manfred has allegedly insinuated himself involves hundreds of millions of dollars, the idea of "pressure" is essentially unfathomable. In other words, "What?"]]></summary>

Ireland took it on the chin and every other body part from France in a 42-27 loss on Saturday in Dublin. The final score doesn’t really reflect just how brutally the Irish were pounded in the second half of the match. The French players appeared to get bigger, stronger, and faster during a stretch in which they scored 34 unanswered points, crushing the hopes and dreams of the Aviva Stadium crowd and all fans of the tournament’s two-time defending champs. Ireland had a slight lead in the table heading into this much anticipated match, and was the betting favorite to beat France, which would have all but cemented another title in the world’s greatest annual international rugby competition. And what a big title that would be: The Six Nations tournament has been held among Europe’s finest squads since 1883, yet no country has ever won three consecutive outright championships in the event.]]></summary>

Hiring former Bucs executive John Spytek as official GM was an obvious indicator of that, as was Brady’s meet-cute with Matthew Stafford up at a Montana ski resort before Stafford re-upped with the Rams. Shit, Brady even convinced new head coach Pete Carroll that working for this clownshow would be more fulfilling than doing nothing at all!
But now that we’re about to enter the legal tampering period of free agency, also known as “the start of free agency,” Fancy Tom is gonna have to put together an actual roster. He got a head start on that process Friday night by acquiring Geno Smith for a third-round pick.]]></summary>

The score at that moment was 89-84. The Bucks had done this a few times already, scrambled and shoved and shoulder-charged their way to within a couple buckets of the visitors, who despite their all-timer of a win percentage are just a game up on the Oklahoma City Thunder for the NBA's top overall record. Kuzma's three, nailed with 8:55 left in regulation, seemed to keep momentum on Milwaukee's side, after they'd closed a 15-point first-half deficit to four points late in the third quarter.
The sequence to follow, ah, went poorly for the home side. A little over four minutes later, Darius Garland slipped a pass in traffic to a rolling Jarrett Allen, Allen thundered home a right-handed dunk over Brook Lopez, the crowd went absolutely silent, and the scoreboard showed the Bucks still standing flat-footed on 84 points but somehow now 18 points behind the visitors. Doc Rivers called a timeout. The game was over, but Rivers—always a few beats slower about this kind of thing—needed another 92 seconds to fully internalize it, whereupon he emptied his bench for the game's final three minutes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because of Cooper Flagg, the Duke Blue Devils faced their first tough test in a while against UNC on Saturday. Thanks to Flagg, they wound up with a 13-point win anyway.
Flagg committed an obvious offensive foul with 3:18 left in the first half of last night's game, sending him to the bench with three fouls and as many points. The Tar Heels instantly ripped off a 10-2 run, then hit a bunch of difficult shots to give themselves a quick seven-point lead early in the second half. Rather than wilt, Flagg spent the game's final 15 minutes showing why NBA GMs are so high on him. Duke started to run everything through Flagg, and he notched five assists, four blocks, and zero fouls through the rest of the game as the Blue Devils won, 82-69. With little margin for error, Flagg made the right play every time, on both ends of the court. The 18-year-old is so huge and skilled that "the right play" was often something bombastic, like rotating over and erasing a layup despite his own teammate crashing into him, or driving left around intense ball pressure and dunking it, per Flagg's mother, on everyone's "fucking head."]]></summary>

Since the trade for Luka Doncic, the Lakers have looked more formidable than they have since their conference finals run in 2023, compiling an eight-game win streak that included a convincing 23-point victory over the Denver Nuggets, who swept them out of those conference finals. But Saturday night in Boston delivered a bit of a heat check.
It'd be excessive to say that the Celtics embarrassed the Lakers. Boston only led by four at halftime. The third quarter was where it all turned: The visiting team got cold, and the C's built a 22-point lead during that frame by outshooting their opponents 29-13.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eephus, which opens theatrically in limited release beginning March 7, is “designed to break your heart.” Directed and co-written by Carson Lund in his feature debut, the film unfolds across the length of a single Sunday afternoon adult recreational baseball league between Adler’s Paint and the Riverdogs, beginning as the players get dressed in the parking lot and warm up with soft toss, continuing through nine innings of hamstring-testing hustle doubles and crushed cans of Narragansett, and ending as the October dusk fades to night. It’s the last game, and not just of the season: The field will soon be bulldozed to make way for a new elementary school.
Shot over the course of a month on a local field in Douglas, Mass., Eephus is something like the concentrated essence of baseball, packing in a season’s worth of sense memory—the saltiness of a sunflower seed shell, the weight of a batting donut, the greasiness of a streak of eye black—at the languid tempo of a second baseman holding up his index and pinkie finger for the right fielder after the second out of an inning. The banter ebbs and flows between baserunners and fielders, between teammates on either side of the dugout, alternately hotheaded and banal.]]></summary>

Her dad was in the Air Force. Two of her uncles served in the armed forces, one eventually moving to a job at NASA and the other leaving for the postal service. Her mom's father was a state senator in Maine. One of Valenti's sisters is a teacher, and the other works for a transit agency in a major American city. "I was going to work in the public sector, one way or another," Valenti said.
Valenti grew up in the Florida panhandle, where she witnessed Hurricane Katrina whip through the gulf. And she was in high school when the oil drilling rig Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico, killing 11 workers and causing the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history. During the spill, Valenti recalls seeing "no wake zone" signs everywhere to prevent boats' waves knocking tar balls ashore. Every day before school, Valenti would grab the newspaper from the front porch and see a photo of oil billowing out of a wellhead. For months, Valenti wondered if the paper would say that the well was finally capped. The spill was eventually contained after 87 days. "You're sitting there powerless, knowing that this oil is going to kill shorebirds and seabirds, that it's going to kill fish, that it's going to cause birth defects in dolphins," Valenti said.]]></summary>

In the first quarter of the year, a number of the notable new rap albums have come from older rappers, many of whom were most relevant to me when I was a teenager in the 2000s. Some of these albums are more successful than others. One of the stronger efforts comes from 2 Chainz, the Alchemist, and (the much younger) Larry June, who released the collaborative album Life Is Beautiful last month. Here, Chainz and Larry make what could be called Yacht Rap over luxurious, though a little monotonous, Alchemist beats. In this same vein, we've gotten a new Busta Rhymes album, an album from Webbie and his son Tre Savage, and a new album from Jim Jones, fresh off beefing with Cam'ron online over old Dipset drama (again).]]></summary>

But of all the episodes of the podcast that I have not relistened to, the one that we put out last November, in which Drew and the excellent sports-and-politics newsletter writer Denny Carter tried to get me pumped up for the election, is the one I have not relistened to the most. Not because it wasn't a good episode—I remember it as having a good number of laughs and an ideal 50/50 split between politics and not politics—but for reasons that are very obvious.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you watch Kings–Nuggets last night? So did Nikola Jokic. The three-time MVP had one of his worst games of the season against the mediocre and shorthanded Kings, laboring to 22 points and 15 rebounds with seven turnovers and a relatively ghastly minus-seven. Jokic has been struggling a bit by his incredible standards since the all-star break, which is mostly due to opposing coaches borrowing a hilarious stratagem rolled out by Lakers coach JJ Redick in L.A.'s impressive blowout win over Denver two weeks ago. The scheme is simple: Deny Jokic the ball, at any cost, compromising every single other part of your defense if you have to. The scheme runs counter to almost every modern maxim of defense, yet it's working.
In practice, here's what it looked like against Sacramento. Jake LaRavia's only job in the clip below is to essentially box Jokic out, while Markelle Fultz and DeMar DeRozan give like 10 feet of space to Peyton Watson and Russell Westbrook in order to be able to double Jokic the second he gets the ball. You hear maxims like "Force the rest of the team to beat you!" all the time, but rarely do you see defenses contort themselves like this. The Kings keep all five guys within a foot of the paint for the duration of the play, and Westbrook was kind enough to give them what they wanted by running into a poorly considered midrange jumper.]]></summary>

A performer of near infinite utility, able to carry a film single-handedly (Hoosiers) or loom over it with just a few minutes of screen time (No Way Out). Ask a dozen people what their favorite Hackman performance was, and they’ll give you a dozen different answers, none of them wrong. Mine was Crimson Tide. Let me tell you why.
It was 1995. I’d just finished a disastrous freshman year of college that saw me transfer from one school to another at the turn of second semester. I was lonely, disappointed, and deeply unsettled. More important, my spine was fucking killing me. What I thought was some sort of hip pointer—to this day, I don’t actually know what a hip pointer is—turned out to be a blown disc in my back. I needed surgery to fix it. At the end of the school year, a doctor in Manhattan cut into my back, removed the piece of disc lodged against my spinal cord, and then stitched me back up. From there, my mom drove me all the way back to my folks’ house in Connecticut, where a long, manic summer of convalescence awaited me.]]></summary>

Paris Saint-Germain hosted Liverpool in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16 on Wednesday, and thoroughly demolished what has been the best team in Europe this season. The stats were solidly in PSG's favor, as was the flow of the game, the kind that the phrase "one-way traffic" was invented for. In every way but one, this would indicate a dominant win for the Ligue 1 leaders. Unfortunately for the Parisiens, the one advantage they didn't enjoy is the only one that matters.

Cleveland and Oklahoma City, back to back on national television—five hours of the future, including ads. We needn't tell you that your entertainment mileage may vary. The business considerations for a league whose best teams play in those sub-optimal markets are no one’s problem but Silver's and his network overlords, but the commissioner must be shitting a pewter tea set just thinking about it, and Disney the rest of the flatware.
In a league in which LeBron James and Stephen Curry and the Boston Celtics and New York Knicks continue to dominate thanks to some not-very-deeply buried biases, Wednesday’s glimpse into the new reality was illuminating. Lord knows the NBA tried. Example: during a review on an out-of-bounds play, referee Pat Fraher described the ruling by referring to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the league newest badass di tutti badasses, as "SGA"—the hardest of sells for a new big-name player by the weirdest of salesmen.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Feb. 17, an illegal wildcat strike was initiated by corrections officers with the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS). One of their primary demands is to repeal the Humane Alternatives to Long Term Solitary Confinement (HALT) Act. Though New York State has pursued mediation to reverse this work stoppage, including offering to temporarily suspend elements of the HALT Act, the majority of striking officers have yet to return to their posts, leaving the incarcerated population, including myself, locked down and surrounded by chaos. At least seven people have died behind bars since this began. According to eyewitness testimony, at least one of these deaths—that of 22 year old Messiah Nantwi—was caused by a brutal beating at the hands of corrections officers. Other deaths are reportedly due to medical neglect. It is also worth noting that the strike was initiated only three days before the much anticipated announcement of murder charges brought against a group of corrections officers from Marcy Correctional Facility over the death of Robert Brooks. 
As its name suggests, the HALT Act  was designed to ensure incarcerated individuals were treated in more humane ways. Choosing to focus on rehabilitating prisoners rather than continuously and excessively penalizing us, this act prioritizes both the physical and mental health of incarcerated individuals by increasing the amount of time we are permitted social interaction with each other and with our families, while also retaining access to productive programming, such as education and job training.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I see it, there are a few unofficial laws of science journalism when it comes to covering new research. The first and most obvious is that outlets are more likely to cover a press release if it is accompanied by nice-looking, high-resolution photos, because these make readers more likely to click on the story. Outlets are even more likely to pick up the story if those photos are of a charismatic animal: a beloved pachyderm, a striking bird, a sweet little rodent. The second law is that well-funded companies can produce better press releases than most institutions, with galleries of photos, videos, and lists of experts who are just a call away, making these stories easier to write on a tight deadline. The third law is that many journalists are overworked and underpaid, sometimes racing to meet a quota. So when a lavishly produced press release about seemingly feel-good research drops into their lap, featuring an adorable critter as a cherry on top, it is easy to write a simple story, meaning an uncritical one.
All of these laws conspired this week after the biotechnology company Colossal Bioscience released their newly created "woolly mice," which the company describes as a mouse that has been gene-edited to have traits similar to those of woolly mammoths. I have previously written about the many logistical, ethical, and scientific problems with de-extinction, so I will only briefly say that de-extinction is a morally questionable gambit in a time when tens of thousands of species are threatened by extinction. I am thoroughly unconvinced by Colossal's argument that returning extinct species to modern-day habitats, which have considerably warmed since the mammoth went extinct, will make these ecosystems more resilient to climate change. Despite its colossal promises and frequent press releases announcing secondary plans to de-extinct other animals, the company appears more invested in raising capital than restoring an actual mammoth.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's Monday night, and I check my local TV listings to see what women's college basketball games are on. I make a note to catch all the big women's college gymnastics meets coming up on Friday. I dutifully add all the dates for my local NWSL team's games to my calendar. It seems and at some level just is incredibly normal to be watching women's sports at big stadiums and on TV, but I'm also old enough to know that all this progress is due not to moral clarity or some belated public awakening to how good women's sports can be, but to a pair of classic American forces: unintended consequences and bureaucracy.
Women's sports has always hung on by the thinnest of threads. They are not mentioned even once in the law that created them, and once the powers that be realized what that law had done, they went all the way up to the presidency to try and undo it. The NCAA objected to supporting women's sports, and searched for years to find a way out of that obligation. Even President Gerald R. Ford's office seemed concerned about those "women's organizations." Our country's perch atop global women's sports happened not because our leadership desired it, or even cared all that much about it, or held strong feelings about the place of women in society in general. It happened due to a collection of random factors all happening in a specific time and space.]]></summary>

He looks like he just ordered employees at the NIH to email him “five things that made you hype today.” He looks like someone an NFL player would beat the shit out of after mistaking him for Ben Solak. He looks like he believes the future of global economics lies in Queefcoin. You get the idea.
But Gladstone arrives in Jacksonville with a decent pedigree, including a nine-year stint—did he start work after graduating from middle school?—in the Rams’ front office. The Rams are a good NFL organization. They have their shit together, so it would stand to reason that Gladstone, despite the remarkable amount of Charlottesville energy he gives off, would prove surprisingly eloquent up on the podium. Sean McVay is a young guy too, you know! Not every young is hopeless! Maybe this paperboy is just what the moribund Jaguars have always needed!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I first learned to appreciate warm-ups because of Michigan hoops. The football culture at that school was intense to the point where I had multiple panic attacks in that gigantic stadium, but the basketball arena felt something like home. If you got there early enough, on the one or two times a week that the men's team would play, you could sit right behind the bench, practically on the floor. I liked it so much more than football not only because of the decreased BAC and ambient hysteria but also for the way you could see the athletes as real people—your peers, really—and not just maize and blue gladiators. With the pep band playing familiar tunes—"I Want You Back" and "You Can Call Me Al" and so on—I could get lost in their preparations: the careful stretching-out of recent injuries, the slightly forbidden thrill of attempting a showy dunk or an ultra-long-range shot, the choreography of staff members each with their own small role to play, even if it was just fetching rebounds. It was an almost meditative way to settle in before the emotional stress to come.
I still make a point of arriving early enough to catch warm-ups—especially when I'm watching hockey, where the beauty of the skate-around a half-hour before the advertised start time carries the warmth of a religious ritual. On Tuesday, as the New York Islanders hosted the Winnipeg Jets, I was one of a very few in position to enjoy this routine—the lack of fans symbolic of an uninspiring season. But the empty seats did not portend a desolate night.]]></summary>

So what does a thinking Hall of Famer do when he wants to chill, but also doesn’t mind making a few million per year on the side?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the perks of observing LeBron James's 22 NBA seasons is constantly being presented with new, concise ways to sum up the absurdity of that career. Here's one he gave us during last night's 136-115 win over the Pelicans: In a game where James went for 34-8-6 and became the first player in league history to score 50,000 combined postseason and regular-season points, his son played four minutes of garbage time and scored two points.
Give a night like that to any other NBA player navigating the downslope of his career, and it might land like a party. One last game in which the old man summons what remains of his guile and athleticism to remind people that he really used to be like that. Michael Jordan spent the last years of his career sweating out turnaround jumpers in Washington for the sake of chasing nights like these. For LeBron James, who is 40 years old, Tuesday night was just another routine game in what might be the most impressive season of this guy's career.]]></summary>

He has also been a general manager for three years in Phoenix under noted loonball Bob Sarver, worked alongside Marv Albert at ESPN, which is to say listened to Marv Albert, nearly took the Knicks job when they were embarking on a seven-year stretch of .315 basketball, voiced himself on an episode of Clone High scouting for something called "Tropical Hospital," and has worked alongside all the versions of Draymond Green for more than a decade. Hell, with all that he should look like Dick Van Dyke sticking his head out of a speeding car window, spaniel-style.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ten minutes into the first quarter of the Dallas Mavericks' Monday night blowout loss to the Sacramento Kings, Kyrie Irving maneuvered around a Kai Jones screen and into the lane, where he split two help defenders, took a bump, and landed oddly on his left foot. His knee crumpled and he immediately went to the floor, calling for the Mavs' athletic training staff. That unit is as used to this sort of thing as any in the NBA. Irving's insistence on staying in the game to shoot his free throws (he made them both) was initial cause for optimism, but ESPN's Shams Charania reported on Tuesday morning that Irving had torn his ACL. The Mavericks, who were already screwed, are now totally terminal.
The theory of the Luka Doncic-Anthony Davis trade, or at least the most coherent available rationalization, was that the Mavericks were trying to win a championship right now, this year. In L.A., Davis had begun agitating to play alongside a true center (touching; was the Boogie Cousins experiment really so formative?), and he'd finally get his wish in Dallas. The Mavs could play their new do-it-all big man alongside either Daniel Gafford or Dereck Lively II and reliably beat the crap out of opponents while Irving shouldered the majority of the shot-creation burden. One could look around at the rest of the Western Conference and credibly think this formula could win three playoff series, provided P.J.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A week into February, Kaesee Bourne was nervous about her job. Last August, she had joined the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a fish and wildlife biologist working in California and Nevada. "What should have been a stable job had started to become very unstable," she said. After Donald Trump took office, Bourne and her colleagues begun receiving a barrage of concerning emails, memorandums, and instructions—not from their supervisors, or even people who were a part of the Fish and Wildlife leadership, but from representatives of the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM). This obscure federal agency has been tasked with the campaign of mass firings of federal workers led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.
When Bourne saw an OPM email asking for a list of probationary employees at Fish and Wildlife—a status that refers to recently hired employees, or employees recently moved into a new position—she asked her supervisor about it. But Bourne's supervisor had no additional insight; they had both received the email at the same time. "I've been hearing that the goal of the new administration was to make people feel stressed out and just make them feel the chaos," Bourne said. "It definitely worked."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of fear in this country is directly caused by guns. According to the CDC, there were over 48,000 firearm-related deaths in the U.S. in 2022, and the specific way in which a gun can kill you—without warning, painfully, at any age, in basically any place—only multiplies the dread. I grew up inundated with stories of mass murder: Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Sandy Hook. The worst nightmares come when it hits home—when the people shot are from your community (Pulse), your roots (Oxford, Michigan), or a critical part of your everyday life (the NYC subway). But gun violence is no less devastating when it doesn't make national news: a child shot on the street in your neighborhood, a friend's older brother's suicide, domestic violence taken to lethal extremes. The capacity to destroy bestowed by a gun on whoever holds it—a cop, a kid, a hunter—is a power that should be regarded with horror.
Over the past several months, another fear has increased in prevalence among trans people in particular: the fear of a government that is not just ignorant or apathetic about our existence but is actively working to eradicate us from public life. It is the position of the Trump administration that trans people do not exist, and therefore do not have rights. Confronted with the inconvenient fact of our ongoing lives, the President, Elon Musk, and their cronies are fighting to block our access to healthcare, fire us from our jobs, threaten our safety, and limit our ability to leave the country.]]></summary>

Because in the heat of battle during the ninth round of a shockingly fabulous and dramatic WBA lightweight title fight Saturday night, against underdog challenger Lamont Roach in Brooklyn, Davis did just that. And he got away with it. Then again, this fight was full of the unexpected, not least of which was the majority draw the judges gave the fight after 12 fascinating rounds. The Barclays Center crowd, which was very pro-Davis at the beginning of the night, booed loudly when the decision was announced, knowing the champ had been saved by the referee and feeling Roach was robbed on the scorecards.]]></summary>

Should Democrats attend Donald Trump's address to the joint session of Congress Tuesday night? The party can't decide what to do. Some Democratic senators and representatives want to boycott the event, to deny Trump's frenetic and lawless program of misrule any of the ceremonial trappings of the presidency. Others want to show up and participate as a rebuke to Trump—including the party's leaders in both chambers, Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, who, Axios wrote, "want members to attend and bring special guests who have been negatively affected by the administration."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might feel somewhat discordant, given that JD Vance's most prominent physical feature is a golf-ball head that makes his body look like a tee, but the administration he's part of is one that understands the value of performance. How else are you supposed to read Vance aligning himself with a broccoli-cut racist and against his own children? Or Vance joining Marco Rubio and Donald Trump to stage an ambush on Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy this past Friday? That they invited him to the Oval Office to call him an ungrateful broke boy is itself pretty nasty and evil, though the most striking aspect of the airing of grievances was its staging. It was less a forum for diplomacy and more a show for the public, captured by several cameras and conducted in front of a jeering press corps. The point was not just to humiliate a soon-to-be former ally, but to be seen humiliating him by a public who is being told that this counts as action.
That sort of geopolitical kabuki feels maddening and somewhat abstract, and while the nature of Vance's arrangement with political power and capital is such that he is largely insulated from consequences, the good news is that Vance still can be told to fuck off when he deigns to be among the people. That is not the same as meaningfully fucking off, but it must have felt so good to be among the gathered Vermonters who protested Vance's planned ski getaway this past weekend. Vance and his family went up to Sugarbush Resort in Vermont's Mad River Valley—if you ever find yourself there, check out Canteen Creemee—and instead of the peaceful vacation they imagined for themselves, they got screamed at. Around 1,000 people lined the streets of Waitsfield, and several people skiing alongside Vance on the mountain brought signs and yelled at him when they got the chance. Enough people were annoying or troublesome enough that the Vance family moved their planned stay from a resort to a private residence and eventually cut short their planned four-day trip.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Academy Awards are goofy. Always have been. A combination of theater-kid pageantry overload and an earnest celebration of Hollywood, or maybe just of the people working in Hollywood. The show has never had its finger on the pulse of the art form, settling instead on keeping its foot on the sternum, and the movies that lose usually say more about the state of the medium than the movies that win.
This year's slate of nominees featured very few truly great movies, but also very few truly bad ones. So a lukewarm Oscars telecast is exactly what everyone should've expected. A few laughs, a couple surprises, and no one walks away feeling particularly good or bad about any of it in totality. Good work!]]></summary>

For what, we're not sure, and with jurisdiction he does not have, he has decided that Rose needs to be reintegrated into America's good graces in the way Rose expressly said he didn't want it: posthumously.
But as the master of the grand and clumsy gesture, the Snickers-bar-in-chief said he was going to pardon him anyway, claiming with syntactical shoes-on-the-wrong-feet grace that Rose "never betted against himself, or the other team. He had the most hits, by far, in baseball history, and won more games than anyone in history." How Rose's betting slips or his Baseball Reference page covers his conviction for tax evasion is hard to parse, as is the claim that he "never betted against himself or the other team" unless he was trying to middle every bet he ever made by betting both ways.]]></summary>
