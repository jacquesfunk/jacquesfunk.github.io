        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a general rule, you do not want to know what sportswriters are eating. Assume that it's happening at strange times and in strange ways. Some of this is due to the specific pressures of the job; some of it is just because sportswriters are strange. Sportswriters, on balance, are probably not as strange about food as the people that talk about sports on TV—Jim Nantz orders his toast briquette style; Ian Eagle claims that he has never "ingested" a condiment; Michael Kay once said he had never tried coffee or soup, and didn't eat an egg until he was 62 years old—but sportswriters do not get paid as much, either. Just know that there are a lot of finicky habits in this industry. (Not me, though. I am normal.)
In one sense, the strangest thing about the grocery run that New York Post baseball columnist Jon Heyman posted on Twitter on Thursday is that the order itself is not very strange at all. It's the sort of stuff that a sportswriter might enjoy while writing about sports: a big container of blueberries, popcorn (unpopped), Diet Coke, and cashews. Surely Heyman has peers whose last grocery receipts are far more unsettling. But think about the items above, and how much you would pay for them at the store. Would it be nearly $50? Would you be so upset about how close it is to $50 that you post about it online?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a pleasing symmetry to the Mission: Impossible brand cycle: 30 years between the 1966 debut of the original CBS television series created by Bruce Geller to the 1996 cinematic reboot starring Tom Cruise, and again between that first film and what would appear to be the final installment of the franchise this summer with Mission: Impossible–The Final Reckoning. A childhood favorite of Cruise’s, the original show is, for anyone tempted to look back, a portal to an era of American television that was willing to be goofy. Still, Mission: Impossible was always a heist series at heart. Inspired by the 1964 film Topkapi, which features a team of thieves attempting to steal from the titular palace of Sultan Mahmud I, Mission: Impossible the show melded the heist plot with obligatory espionage elements at a time when James Bond and Get Smart followed similar trends. 
By now, almost no one thinks of the television series, so wholly has the film franchise and its zealous lead actor taken over the past three decades, weathering seachange after seachange in the already turbulent, risky landscape of Hollywood. Behind it all, of course, is Cruise himself, who began Mission: Impossible as the first project for the now-defunct Cruise/Wagner Productions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On April 7, the New Yorker and Time ran nearly identical stories that might be better described as press releases for the de-extinction company Colossal Biosciences. The two stories differed slightly: the New Yorker's headline proclaimed "The Dire Wolf Is Back," whereas Time's announced "The Return of the Dire Wolf." While the New Yorker led with a photo of a cub, Time led with a photo of a fully grown wolf. But the effect of these stories was the same, both creating the impression that the dire wolf is indeed back after 10,000 years of extinction.
What these stories seemed less interested in was the fact that the dire wolf was, in fact, not at all back, nor will it return anytime soon. Colossal is a company that runs on PR stunts, and the latest hoopla instigated a wave of criticism from scientists seeking to set the record straight: The "dire wolf" on the cover of these glossy magazines was not a dire wolf, meaning an individual of the extinct canine species Aenocyon dirus. Instead, the "dire wolf" was a modern wolf with 20 genetic edits, none of which involved the splicing of actual dire wolf DNA. "It’s not a dire wolf. It’s misleading to call it that," Vincent Lynch, an evolutionary biologist at the University at Buffalo, told Chemical and Engineering News. “I can't explain how pissed off it made me, because they're still saying this stuff, and they know it to not be true.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It can be hard to tell when it is safe to officially declare a bad baseball team a historically bad one. You usually kind of know it when you see it, but passing certain mile markers allows you to affirmatively point the finger and declare: These men belong in the piss pot of history.
One such signpost arrives when words like "worst" and "since" start popping up alongside years that start with 18. The Colorado Rockies hit that point on Thursday night, after losing 2-0 to the Philadelphia Phillies to push their season record to 8-42. The Rockies are now sole owners of the worst 50-game start in baseball's modern era. You have to go all the way back to the 1895 Louisville Colonels, who started 7-43, to find a team that performed worse through its first 50 games. This team is squarely on the path trodden by the 2024 White Sox, who spent a good chunk of that campaign threatening to break the 1899 Cleveland Spiders' record for most losses in a season (134), but ultimately had to settle for the modern-era record (121). The Rockies are currently on pace to blow past the White Sox and pip the Spiders with 136 losses.]]></summary>

Whatever. It does not matter that the Eagles have won two Super Bowls in eight seasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Paul Maurice was hired out of retirement to heal the Florida Panthers' multitude of competitive leprosies, he was called in some corners "the enemy of fun." This happened because of the way he likes to play—simple, direct, minimizing open-ice flair, and emphasizing all things heavy. He is not a brutish tactician, but he recognized, without ever having the CV to prove it, that winning in April, May, and June requires a devotion to power, persistence, and crowd control in front of the net that hockey’s regular season dilettantes never seem to fully grasp.
But, and we're being fair here, Paul Maurice is indeed also the enemy of fun. We can say this because the Panthers' Eastern Conference Final series against the Carolina Hurricanes is already deeply and profoundly un-fun, in the classic only-one-team-is-getting-its-way way. Beating the 'Canes on Thursday night by the frankly rude score of 5-0 was lopsided enough, but other than an offside call that negated Carolina's only real chance of the night, that score was actually a kindness. Put another way, through the first 40 minutes, the only two differences between the 'Canes and Angel Reese were a) there were 17 more of them than her, and b) she got off more shots.]]></summary>

This week, we were joined by Jason Steinhauer, the historian behind the History Club newsletter and the bestseller History, Disrupted, to discuss those questions, and the historical and cultural forces that created them, and to start working toward some answers.

They will feel sadness and pain and disappointment many times during their years on Earth, just like you and I, but unlike you and I they will maintain access to all the blessings that money and talent and beauty bring them. For the most part, we only ever get to see them in the latter state, and it's easy to conclude that all that good stuff they have makes their lives invariably better than ours on a day-to-day basis.
Sports can be an equalizer in this regard. Think about how bad the days after your worst moments as a sports fan felt. Every time my favorite team gets eliminated from the playoffs, I end up going through the next day in a sickly daze, feeling much like I did the morning after the 2016 election. This is not rational, but it is what being a sports fan does to my brain. Now imagine how much more intense that awful feeling is hitting Knicks fans today, hours after they witnessed their team cough up a playoff game in unthinkable fashion.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know what I expected from a European final between the 16th- and 17th-placed teams in the Premier League, but it wasn't that. Maybe I was fooled by the stature of Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United as two of the biggest clubs in England, or maybe I figured that a final would bring out the best of two sides just crawling through a doomed domestic season in hopes that summer cures all ills. Instead, the 2025 Europa League final was ass. Butt. Garbage. Nevertheless, at the end of 90 painful minutes, there was a light at the end of this sewage pipe of a match: For the first time since 2008, Tottenham won a trophy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Colorado Rockies are 8-41. Wednesday night’s 9-5 loss to the Phillies was their fourth in a row. Their .163 winning percentage is the worst in baseball. They have scored 164 runs and allowed 321. No one on the team’s hitting over .288; Ryan Feltner is the only starter with an ERA under 5.00. They are really bad.
This naturally makes it hard for in-house media to find anything positive to say about the team. By going out there every day and Being The Rockies, the worst team in the sport seems to have broken the brains of its PR team.

Not long before, he complains to the narrator about readers: “People talking about a book as if it were just another thing, like a dish, or a product like an electronic device or a pair of shoes, to be rated for customer satisfaction—that was just the goddamn trouble.” Students submit papers that say, “I hate Joyce, he’s so full of himself.” Online reviewers imply, “if a book didn’t affirm what the reader already felt—what they could identify with, what they could relate to—the author had no business writing the book at all.” The famous author quits teaching, quits writing. The state of the novel, its place in the world, is too depressing.
“But hasn’t it always been this way?” asks the narrator.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made a fateful decision ahead of the Eastern Conference Finals. I think it was Sunday. The night before, the New York Knicks had finished off the defending champion Boston Celtics. The Indiana Pacers were already waiting around, having thrashed the East's top seed in five games. It took me into Sunday to go huh, Pacers-Knicks. Do I care about that? I considered this deeply, the way one might ponder a puppy in a pet-shop window. Am I prepared to give my heart to this stupid thing? I decided, yes, I would buy the puppy. I activated the button inside my brain that allows for a feeling of cheesedness to adhere to a matchup between these two specific franchises, in a conference final, in 2025.
You see, I am old enough to remember a little thing we used to call the 1990s. The Knicks and Pacers were good teams then, back when making the playoffs used to mean something. There was a stretch, starting in 1993, when these two teams eliminated each other six times in eight years. Do not look up how many titles they combined to win over this period! The point is that a great deal of animosity built up between them, and many goofy narratives blossomed from the rivalry, and the whole era kicked ass. These teams played to Game 7s in 1994 and 1995 (and again last year), and met in consecutive conference finals in 1999 and 2000. Reggie Miller became a folk hero; guys like Dale Davis, Charles Smith, and Travis Best were pressed temporarily but firmly into mainstream basketball discourse. John Starks brushed perilously close to bozodom. Yes, I am now openly pandering to readers of my generation, but such is my prerogative. Basketball was aesthetically better in 1997! No one can stop me! Ha ha!]]></summary>

Buehler was put on the IL with a shoulder injury on May 2; the inflammation cleared up fast enough that he was activated Tuesday morning without any rehab assignment. Cora’s absence was even briefer: To the ire of one Boston talk radio guy, Cora missed Monday’s game to attend his daughter’s college graduation.
“It’s not like they need him there to make the pitching change or lay down the bunt. It’s the leadership and optics of the whole thing,” 98.5 The Sports Hub host Michael Felger said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ten NFL teams voted against banning the Tush Push today, leaving the Philadelphia Eagles free to convert short-yardage plays at will. Somewhere inside of a Tilted Kilt, a freshly extended Nick Sirianni busts out his finest shit-eating grin in exultation.
As befitting the play itself, the Eagles had to grind this one out. The Tush Push was in grave danger of being outlawed two months ago when the Green Bay Packers had seemingly amassed a quorum of votes (24 were needed) to get their No Butt Stuff proposal approved at the NFL owners meetings. At the time, Packers coach Matt LaFleur derided the Tush Push as being too “rugby”-ish to belong in football (American football has its origins in rugby). The organization also considered the play a safety risk (competition committee chairman Rich McKay said there was no statistical evidence that the play is more dangerous than any other) and caused “pace of play” issues (uh, OK). No sane person bought any of those arguments. Whether the Packers were acting on their own behalf or at the nudging of commissioner Roger Goodell, who is rumored to abhor the Tush Push, the intent was always transparent: We can’t keep letting the Eagles get away with this. Given what I know about the Eagles and their fans, that’s normally a sentiment I’m down with. But not this time.]]></summary>

With this in mind, we can again say one of the best-loved and certainly most frequently repeated sentences in contemporary baseball: Rich Hill is BACK!
His generic name aside, Rich Hill has been eased out of more throwing-related major league jobs than anyone this side of Josh Johnson, though in fairness this is Hill’s 24th year in professional baseball, and he is 45 years old. But when he signed a minor league deal with the injury-ravaged Kansas City Royals, it just felt right. When he pitched his first game for the Royals' Arizona Complex League team yesterday against the Chicago Cubs' representatives, it went swimmingly—four innings, 12 hitters, 12 outs, seven strikeouts. There is more work to be done, but go ahead and say it: Rich Hill is totally BACK!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The saddest stories in local news are the ones where the body has been left to sit for a while. I worked in local news for the first decade of my journalism career, and that often meant writing about people who died. Sometimes people died after a long and glorious life; all too often, they died far too young, and in easily avoidable tragedies. But every now and then a news release would come across my desk from local law enforcement asking for help identifying a body that they had found, and along with it a slew of horrible questions: How long had this person been dead? Did anyone notice they were gone? Death comes for all of us, but not all deaths are equal. Some are more cruel than others.
I remembered that feeling Tuesday, when news broke that the Chicago Sun-Times and The Philadelphia Inquirer had both published a special section—HEAT INDEX Your Best of Summer Guide—whose recommended summer reading list included a bunch of made-up books by real authors, the names and titles thrown together seemingly at random. It got worse from there. When reporters from 404 Media and later The Atlantic contacted the person who wrote the summer book list, he explained that he wrote it—or, anyway, put it together—using ChatGPT, and then had just forgotten to double check the work before submitting it to the company that had commissioned it, King Features, a division of newspaper publisher Hearst. The words, seemingly still unread by anyone who'd notice or care that they were mostly nonsense, then got shoveled along. Hearst packaged the words, then licensed the section to various newspapers, which duly printed it out and included it in their Sunday editions. If anyone did notice the many mistakes along the way, they sure didn't stop them. No surprise, a lot of writers and readers got very mad about this online.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spike Lee didn't invent the floating dolly shot, but he did make it his signature move. It's not just in his repeated use of the technique, but rather in his understanding of its storytelling potential. In Mo' Better Blues, the dolly shot captured Bleek's obsession with his trumpet and how it mirrored the devotion he brought to sex with his two girlfriends. In Clockers, the dolly showed how Strike's lifestyle of selling drugs, running from the cops, and being accused of a murder was destroying him both physically and mentally. In 25th Hour, the dolly captured both Mary's drunken euphoria as a young woman at a party as well as Jacob's out-of-body experience after abdicating responsibility for a moment. Spike uses the dolly to help him imbue his characters with depth, psychology, and conflict without uttering a word. In other hands, the dolly is often deployed at significant moments, or sometimes at seemingly mundane ones just to add some visual flair. Rarely does a Spike joint use the dolly as the definitive moment of his work. In fact, as far as I can remember there is only one Spike Lee movie in which the entirety of the film builds up to one particular dolly shot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a sequence in the first quarter of Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals where the Oklahoma City Thunder used a drive-and-kick and a swing pass to get the ball to versatile young noodleman Chet Holmgren, who'd floated to a whiteboard-perfect shooting position out above the break. Naz Reid of the visiting Timberwolves hastened to close out on Holmgren, who is a danger from deep. Holmgren showed a decent enough pump-fake to cause Reid to overcommit, and then darted to his right for a straight-line drive to the cup. Chasing a ball-handler from 27 feet is a tall ask for a big man, and here Reid was cleanly beaten. Holmgren's handles are certainly adequate to this task, and anyway all he needs is one dribble to get from the arc to a controlled one-foot gather. The last man back was Donte DiVincenzo, and DiVincenzo was late. This looked like a dunk.
Reid is quicker than Holmgren, and his movement patterns are more recognizably humanoid, so he was never far from the play. As Holmgren gathered for take-off, Reid sprinted on an intercepting path and used his chest to deflect Holmgren off of the runway. The impact slowed Holmgren's momentum—Holmgren still has the physique of someone who needs to speed-eat 100,000 beef sandwiches—which allowed Reid to make a reasonably controlled contest of what became a stalled, off-balance layup. The ball rimmed out, the Timberwolves gathered the defensive rebound, and the action flowed the other way.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Mets are in a chumpy way at the moment. They have scored 10 runs in their last six games and have just one home run over that stretch. If you look at this from the perspective of wanting the Mets to score runs, that is annoying, but it is also probably not very important. Even very good teams will phase in and out of chump mode over the course of a long season, because that is the nature of the baseball season and also the nature of baseball. This doesn't make it less annoying when it happens to a team you care about, and sometimes teams that are expected to be good really do turn out not to be. But because this sort of thing is so inextricably a part of baseball, there's nothing to do but figure out how to discern what's noise and what isn't, and then get to work ignoring everything that deserves to be ignored.
For instance: the Los Angeles Dodgers have allowed 32 runs in their last 36 innings, which covers a four-game losing streak during which they were swept in a three-game series at Dodger Stadium, by the Angels; in a loss on Monday night, they swung at 42 of Diamondbacks starter Brandon Pfaadt's 93 pitches, didn't miss any of them, and had a .000 batting average on balls in play. They have 29 wins, a .604 winning percentage, and are in first place in the National League West. They have real problems—a number of starting pitchers with a number of variously severe or worryingly vague injuries, most notably—but they are not bad. It would be reasonable for a fan to get mad, watching this highly credentialed team blast one Brandon Pfaadt pitch after another directly at a waiting Diamondback fielder. Anything more than that would be ... well, no one gets into being a fan of a baseball team to be reasonable. But it would be excessive.]]></summary>

We 80ennials were taught to fear many things: strangers with candy, masked serial killers, drugs, drug dealers, and hot sex. Anything in the cultural firmament that wasn’t a rerun of Happy Days could corrupt your innocence permanently.
Popular music wasn’t immune to this cultural puritanism. The Tipper Gores of the country were barnstorming the media throughout that whole decade, warning American families that Ozzy Osbourne was biting the heads off of bats, that Judas Priest was encouraging kids to commit suicide, and that Madonna was dry humping award show stages. These artists were poisoning young minds, and something had to be done to prevent it. Perhaps a very small warning label on every album cover would do the trick.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tottenham Hotspur has lost 21 times this season and sits 17th in the Premier League table—unimaginable for a club of its size and resources. While attempting to play the progressive attacking game mandated by their second-season manager Ange Postecoglou—an enigmatic style known as Angeball—Spurs’ players have often looked like they have forgotten, and possibly never knew, how to pass at all. Against Chelsea in April, Tottenham's own fans chanted "you don't know what you're doing" at the manager. For months, the pundits have screeched a common refrain: "Why hasn’t Ange been fired already?"
And on Wednesday, when Tottenham plays Manchester United in the Europa League final, Ange has a chance to salvage it all. A win would be the club’s first trophy in 17 years, its first European trophy since 1984, and would spell a return to the Champions League. It’s a ridiculous situation made even more so by the manager’s early-season reference to his track record: at every team he’s ever managed for multiple years—Australian clubs South Melbourne and Brisbane Roar, the Australian national team, Japan’s Yokohama F. Marinos, and Scotland’s Celtic—he’s won something in his second year. To the last few hardcore Angeball defenders still out there among Spurs fandom, myself among them, it would be sweet redemption.]]></summary>

Would the veteran-laden squads who'd done it before triumph again, or would the new generation put their elders out to pasture? The second round was a clear referendum in favor of the zoomer uprising, with the last three champions—the Boston Celtics, Denver Nuggets, and Golden State Warriors—getting eliminated. 
When the confetti falls a month from now, the seventh different champion in as many years will hoist the trophy. The four remaining teams have won one title between them—two if you feel that the 1979 Seattle SuperSonics title travels (the Oklahoma City Thunder themselves don't wear the gold patch)—and that one was over 50 years ago.

She was immediately tended to by medical staff, who performed chest compressions. Once she was stable, she was carted off the field and transported to a hospital by ambulance. Other players appeared emotional during the stoppage of play. Ten minutes after King collapsed, the match continued. 
After the game finally ended, players hugged and cried. Utah player Alex Loera, who was teammates with King last year at Bay FC, led the teams in a prayer circle. Shortly after that, Christen Press was interviewed on the broadcast. She had scored her first goal of the season—it was a signature Press how’d you make that ball move like that? shot—just a few minutes before King collapsed. But her focus wasn’t on the win at all. “I think this game has been very emotional, very tough. All of us are praying for Savy, our teammate. … She is on our hearts and minds and that’s really all I can think about right now,” Press said. “It was a really, really emotional game.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[METRO DETROIT — It’s early Sunday evening on the last weekend of April, and I’m perched beside a currently-out-of-use lane in a dimly lit section of Thunderbowl Lanes in Allen Park, Mich. On this particular weekend, Thunderbowl was the site of the Professional Bowlers Association’s Battle of the Brands, and after a raucous finale, the hubbub has subsided. The crew members are switching off the bright lights that illuminated the lanes for TV. Pro bowlers quietly weave in and out of the event zone to collect their ball bags. Most of the adoring fans who packed the stands have headed home. A few remain, eagerly waiting along the edge of barricaded lanes with signs and jerseys, hoping for a parting memory with their bowling heroes. Then there is my mother, sunken into the bleachers, heart heavy with history as she takes in the scene. But we’ll get back to that.
My gaze wanders across the massive bowling center—in modern-day bowling parlance, bowling alley is out, and bowling center is in. Thunderbowl Lanes is a curious convergence of future and past. The laneside computers are up-to-date, the screens work, the place is clean and more than equipped to host events like Battle of the Brands. But the carpet has a busy retro pattern, the bartop tables whisper echoes of the 70s, and the lettering out front eschews modern minimalism for a nostalgic chunky design.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tony Mansolino has been put in a tough position. It is his job today to engineer a turnaround for the most disappointing team in baseball. The Baltimore Orioles fired manager Brandon Hyde Saturday morning, after the team played sloppily and stranded a billion baserunners in a loss Friday night, their fourth in a row and 10th in 12 games. No one on earth could credibly claim that Hyde is bad at managing a baseball team: He took over in Baltimore when they were hopeless garbage, stuck it out through years of deliberate organizational ass-shitting, and then notched a dominant 100-win season the very first time he was handed a genuinely professional-grade roster. Along the way Hyde earned some managerial accolades and helped the O's to just their second first-place finish of this millennium. There is no question that Hyde can lead a very good baseball team.
The Orioles of 2025 stink real bad. They're 10th-worst in the majors by team OPS, and are second-worst in the majors by team ERA. Hunt around in the cool math if you must—Orioles hitters are generally underperforming their perfectly respectable expected numbers, per Statcast—but the very basic formula there is pretty straightforward: Baltimore's pitching staff allows too many runs, and their vaunted lineup is not doing anywhere near enough slugging to make up the difference. This team was talked-up as a World Series contender. With their eerily homogenized core of ultra-hyped position players, 2025 should be safely inside the early part of a long championship-or-bust era. Instead they are a last-place team, 11.5 games back of the Yankees and with a run differential that is second-worst in the majors, ahead of only the Colorado Rockies, who are a blight on the sport.]]></summary>

Germany and France both wrapped up their 34-match leagues this past weekend, crowning familiar champions in Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain with plenty of time left over. Liverpool clinched the Premier League title at the end of April, and Barcelona claimed its trophy last Thursday.
While there are still some battles to be had over Champions League qualification in England—where five teams vie for three spots—and a relegation struggle between Espanyol and Leganés in Spain, there's not much action at the top of European soccer heading into the final weekend of the season, save for in Italy, where there's a title race, a fight for the Champions League places, and a five-team brawl to escape relegation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Carlos Alcaraz’s shotmaking style is of the gonzo variety: He’ll opt for the unlikely winner attempt whenever possible, even when safe options are available. As a consequence, Alcaraz at his best is among the most viscerally thrilling spectacles in sports. At his worst, he could play against a potted plant and enable convincing arguments that the plant has better court sense. Through six points of his first-set tiebreak with No. 1-ranked Jannik Sinner in the Italian Open final on Sunday, Alcaraz had seemingly heeded his critics and pursued reliable patterns. He opened up a 4-2 lead with a backhand pass just good enough to force an error, then a few big serves sprinkled on top. Very effective, nothing that made the highlight reel. 
Then the players switched ends of the court, and Alcaraz couldn’t help reverting to type. He double faulted. He mashed an errant forehand down the line instead of hitting the appropriate, neutral ball crosscourt. But on set point, Alcaraz conjured a masterpiece. He took immediate control of the point despite Sinner landing a first serve, slashing heavy forehands deep into the court that forced Sinner back. He fired a backhand down the line, stretching Sinner out just a bit, then pranced to the net. While running to his right, Alcaraz chopped his volley short and gentle to his left, working against all his forward momentum. Airborne on the follow-through, his right foot flew up almost to head-height. Nothing about it looked right. It worked perfectly. Alcaraz won the tiebreak with that on-brand brilliance, then tore through the second set, 6-1, to win his first Italian Open title.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everything you need to know about the last decade of Maple Leafs hockey can be found in the Panthers' third and backbreaking goal of Florida's Game 7 shitkicking. Toronto was getting outskated, and under fire in a barrage unequaled by any team all year. They had held, until they hadn't: two goals four minutes apart had stunned the building into a queasy silence. The next one felt like the decider for this game—and this series, this season, this era. A Leafs goal would put them right back in it; a Cats tally the bursting of floodgates. The deluge did not let up, Florida's relentless forecheck making it an ordeal to simply exit one's own zone.
John Tavares, who was the expensive but inevitable "final piece" seven long years ago, handed off the "C" before this season, and is now officially back on the market, was harassed by a pair of Panthers as he tried to bring the puck out. A sloppy and precarious pass along the boards was swiped by a hustling Seth Jones, who cleverly avoided triggering an offside call until Jonah Gadjovich touched up. Then, doing a U-turn to get back on defense, Morgan Rielly, the blueline representative of Toronto's homegrown core four, just ... fell down? For no reason?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The lure of a Game 7 is typically so much more appealing than its actual delivery. Hockey manages this better than basketball, to be sure (the seventh games in the NBA Playoffs this decade have an average final score of 113-95), but it still has the Toronto Maple Leafs and their self-administered crises of confidence with which to contend. With all due respect to the Washington Wizards, Miami Marlins, and New York Jets, nobody does fatalism like the Leafs, because nobody fails the big moments like the Leafs.
That said, Sunday night's 6-1 loss to the blatantly superior Florida Panthers came as a blow to even the most easily disillusioned Leaf supporters. Even if those fans were skeptical at best about their heroes' chances going into the arena, they still crashlanded midway through the second period into the standard Torontonian response to games gone bad and hopes turned sad—19,000 people sitting in pouty silence, at least until the end of the game when their silence turned to boos.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It took the Oklahoma City Thunder about four minutes to kill the Denver Nuggets dead. With just over three minutes left to play in the second quarter of Sunday's Game 7, the Thunder were leading, 42-41. By the time there was 10:59 left to play in the third quarter, they were up 66-46 and the game was undeniably over.
The Thunder do this a lot. A team will start out fairly well against them, maybe even keep the game close all the way into the fourth quarter, but then OKC will turn on what Patrick Redford calls the steals-and-dunks machine, which does exactly what it says on the box. The Thunder will pick a moment in the game to raise their always-high defensive intensity to another level, and before the other team can really understand what's happening, they have been buried under an avalanche of turnovers and transition buckets. The Thunder turned Denver over five times during that four-minute stretch of Game 7, shot 9-of-10 from the field, and outscored them 24-5. It just kept going like that for the rest of the game, until the Nuggets emptied the bench and voluntarily initiated garbage time with 9:36 left to play.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My life has always included cats. Even before owning a cat, I played with all the cats at the pet store inside the local mall and relentlessly begged my parents for one, who finally gave in somewhere in the early 1990s and let me adopt an orange tabby. As a young woman in my early 20s, I stumbled into owning not one but two cats and didn't adopt any more mostly because one of them, the fierce gray tabby Katharine Graham, made it clear my apartment actually was her queendom and, outside of her adopted sister, Lilly, she would not share. Katharine passed in 2020, and Lilly in 2024, putting me in a position I had not been in for about two decades—catless woman. 
It had its perks. Mr. Diana and I never had to worry about finding a cat sitter when we traveled. We didn't have to obsess over making sure no food fell on the floor. If we wanted to sleep in, we did. But at some point after the Los Angeles wildfires, I decided it was time to let cats back into our lives. Rescue groups all over the region were getting flooded with new volunteers offering to foster animals after the fires burned more than 40,000 acres, destroyed more than 12,000 buildings, forced about 200,000 people to be evacuated, and killed 30. It seemed the least we could do as people who were fortunate enough to still have a home was open it up to new cats.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Irish sporting authorities are now having a serious debate about one of the most anachronistic and misogynistic (though not necessarily in that order) rules in all of athletics. Later this week, a dumbass mandate that camogie players must play in a skirt might finally be tossed. And just in time, give or take a century! 
The no-shorts rule (skorts are permitted) has long been on the books of the Camogie Association, one of the primary sanctioning bodies of the Irish sport, which is essentially hurling played by women. There are slight variations in the playing rules between the two games–more contact is allowed in hurling, for example—but none of the differences are as glaring as the disparate dress codes. Hell, the fact that the sports have different names seems as much a symptom of the Irish sporting realm’s gender-based dysfunction as any.]]></summary>

There was Spike Lee, as effusive as ever, along with Bad Bunny, Lenny Kravitz, Ice Spice, and Ben Stiller. But no other celebrity there Friday night quite holds our current zeitgeist, at least among the average reader of this website, quite like Timothée Chalamet, and that's before you factor in he's dating a member of the Kardashian family.
A born-and-bred New Yorker, Chalamet's Knicks fandom makes perfect sense. If anything, he is living every New Yorker's dream, hamming it up with Lee afterward on the court, then getting caught on video leaning out of a black car, high-fiving, screaming, and losing his mind with his fellow Knicks fans—until he almost gets pulled out. The video ends with another person in the vehicle makes a move to bring the 29-year-old actor back in.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A second Bill Belichick interview has hit the morning-show circuit. On Friday's episode of ABC's Good Morning America, the North Carolina football coach returned to demonstrate that his disastrous CBS interview last month was an anomaly, and that he does know how to display emotion of a mildly jovial nature. The encore wasn't nearly as bad as his sitdown with Tony Dokoupil—this time, he wore a hole-free suit—but the results were still mixed.
On this occasion, NFL Hall of Famer Michael Strahan was asking the questions, which made for a more football-friendly environment. Once again the bulk of the conversation focused on Belichick's new book, but it was very funny to watch Strahan clearly signal to his guest that he would eventually address the 24-year-old girlfriend in the room. A couple of times in the nine-minute interview, Strahan references Belichick's "personal life."]]></summary>

Picture a parent holding a screaming toddler on a crowded bus, looking that toddler in the eye, and calmly asking that yowling little booger to explain himself. A tantrum is a tantrum, and it is the nature of things like that to be both unreasonable and unreasoning; in this case, the noisy and furious protagonist of the tantrum is, depending upon your perspective, either the single worst and dumbest member of one generation or the single richest person on earth. 
None of this is what you want, but it also just is what it is: incomplete and unreasonable people demonstrating the limits of their capacity to self-regulate in a way that makes everything worse for everyone else, without really offering the tantrum-author much beyond the satisfaction of turning all that un-understood inner chaos outward. You can't give a child melting down like that what they want, because they do not know what that is. And so thinking about it at all means that you are already thinking about it more than the person thrashing around at the center of it.]]></summary>

Some are very good, many are mediocre, and some are memorably strange. 
This year’s contest has been relatively free of controversy, especially compared to last year’s contest, where fan favorite “Europapa” by Joost (The Netherlands) was unexpectedly disqualified after the semifinals, and crowds of people outside the arena protested Israel’s participation in the contest. We’ll get to the countries, the songs, and the controversies soon, but first I wanted to ask all of the experts on this panel, what is your relationship to the Eurovision Song Contest?

Griffin-Accurso's grave sin is that she wants Israel to stop starving and killing Palestinian children in Gaza. For this, she has become the target of a pro-Israel contingent so committed to suppressing any support for Palestine that they have abandoned basic human dignity. Griffin-Accurso has spoken out on the crisis for a while on her Instagram page, and in the past week, she posted a number of statements that promote organizations which aid children suffering from violence and hunger, including malnutrition in Gaza and famine in Sudan.]]></summary>

Late in the second quarter, Julius Randle nailed a three from the top of the key to give his team the double-digit lead they would hold onto until the game was well in hand. Randle sashayed back on defense with the ease of a man who is assured of his good fortune, hands flapping, beyond comfortable. The broadcast then cut to a shot of Steph Curry, who appeared in a daze, staring unfocused through the court with his lips parted, shaking his head in disbelief.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pimlico Race Course, the second-oldest racetrack in the country, will close after Saturday’s 150th running of the Preakness Stakes. Last week, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore signed off on a plan to demolish the Baltimore track beginning this spring. That's the first step in what’s being billed as a two-year, $400 million publicly funded project to rebuild the historic but decayed racing compound.
I worked at Pimlico for several years in the late 1990s while covering Maryland racing. The track has been hosting thoroughbreds and taking wagers since 1870 (only Saratoga has been around longer), and its allegedly imminent demise was an evergreen story the whole time I worked there, and ever since. The place was a dump with charm in my day. Now, it’s just a dump. A couple days after Gov. Moore signed the demolition order, I went to opening day of Pimlico’s 2025 spring meet and saw the plight first-hand. The main elevator in the clubhouse broke a few years ago and never got fixed. The track operators put up a rickety looking construction lift in the back parking lot at some point, but that was out of commission, also. The only way to get to the press box, my old hangout located on top of the grandstand, was to walk up several flights of stairs in a decrepit stairwell, where the floors at every level were severely water damaged.]]></summary>

In films like Merantau, Apostle, and The Raid diptych, people get chopped by machetes, whacked with broom handles, tossed through floors, kicked into toilets, cracked across concrete tables, and fried on open griddles. His fights are geographic, tracking large numbers of combatants as they fight up, across, and through confined spaces, taking care to note landmarks—windows, doorframes, loose hangnails, and glass-fronted cabinets—before working them into the flow of violence. At his best, his fight scenes marry the chaos of a street brawl with the control of a martial arts tournament match, cranking up the energy without ever losing clarity.
Havoc, his latest Netflix release, has two spectacular brawls: the first in a crowded nightclub, the second in a remote lakeshore cabin. Spanning much of the film’s second half, these fights find Walker (Tom Hardy) fending off corrupt cops and huge crowds of Triad goons—he must leave at least a hundred people dead, wasted by shotgun blasts, hatchet blows, and, in one particularly nasty kill, pierced through the neck by a spear gun. It’s spectacular stuff, visceral and inventive, and infinitely more exciting than any of the John Wick clones that Havoc superficially resembles.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“When Mitchell finally reaches the tube,” Boston Globe movie critic Kevin Kelly wrote in his review of the 1975 film, “you can alleviate its unending boredom by looking forward to the commercials.” Kelly was right that the movie needed an upgrade, and that TV would provide it. But it turns out there was a better way to alleviate the unending boredom of Mitchell.
The movie, in which Baker plays the slobbish cop who gives the film its name, is shown in one of the funniest episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000. In Joel Hodgson’s last episode, he and the bots absolutely ravage Mitchell star Joe Don Baker. They mock his weight. They howl in disgust at a sex scene. “He looks like a middle-aged Chucky.” Tom Servo says. The phrase “chubby blue line” is spoken.]]></summary>

Not all of them are substantive in a classically Substantive way: Last week's episode was about online and offline media, but about a quarter of it was about a truly horrifying regional sandwich; the NBA playoffs and NFL draft episodes were about the NBA playoffs and the NFL draft, but were about those things in a more focused and informed way than some of our previous installments. This week, in welcoming Culture Editor Brandy Jensen to the podcast, we managed to keep the quality streak going while also bringing back the dumb stuff.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is nothing I find more annoying than the fact that exercise makes your brain feel better. Every time I am grumpy and miserable and depressed but still drag my ass off the couch and to the gym, I am filled with annoyance after I'm done. Why does picking up a few heavy things and setting them back down make me feel so much better? Why can't I be rewarded for simply lying down on my couch and watching television? Why do brains work like this? What is the point in having a body?
These questions haunt me, so I was thrilled to read Casey Johnston's new book A Physical Education: How I Escaped Diet Culture and Gained the Power of Lifting. Johnston is a beloved writer for the swole community. She has written about lifting weights for almost a decade, founded a program for people trying to learn how to lift, and now has written the book on why it all matters. She encouraged me almost five years ago to begin lifting, and it quickly became the only form of exercise that did not make me so miserable I wanted to quit it immediately.]]></summary>

We can give ourselves a break, I think: This is less a matter of gross ignorance than it is a simple epistemological deal. Namely, we can't really know that there's a white genocide happening in South Africa, because there isn't one. A person certainly could, however, think or believe that there's a white genocide happening in South Africa. Elon Musk's chatbot spent much of Wednesday working to accomplish that, with all the uncanny ineptitude implied by the terms "Elon Musk" and "chatbot" and "Elon Musk's chatbot."]]></summary>

James Woods, who starred in Videodrome as a man who was sent hallucinations by a CIA cutout, claimed a photo of a crowd gathered to see Kamala Harris was AI generated because one man had a very long neck. While none of these things have appeared in David Cronenberg’s films, they’re all reminiscent of the darkly comic, clinical, technoskeptic essence of his work. Cronenberg never set out to predict the future, but here we are, 26 years after eXistenZ—a film that clocked the immersiveness of video games and the fanaticism of gamer culture—living through the inevitable perils of the technological extension of the human mind and body.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the first 20 or so minutes of The Picture Of Dorian Gray, the Broadway adaptation of the Oscar Wilde novel as a one-woman show starring Sarah Snook, the production asks a genuinely disturbing question: "What if you were watching TV, instead?" At the top of the hour, Snook enters the stage without fanfare, surrounded by crew members—really, they should be considered performers, too—who will spend the next two hours filming her with compact cameras. She takes a seat behind the gigantic vertical screen in the middle of the stage, looks into a lens, and speaks to the audience two-dimensionally.
What follows is a by-heart reading of the start of the book—I'm pretty sure, at least, because I've never read it. Snook does the narration and the dialogue, and then the scope expands, but only sort of. Soon, Snook is costumed as Dorian—one of many characters she plays—and moves around the stage giving, basically, just that performance, as the young man poses for and then desperately admires a painting of himself. Filling out the show is prerecorded work: other Snook performances superimposed on screen or piped in as audio. In a dinner party sequence, for example, she performs live as Lord Henry while portraying the guests—all with their own elaborate costumes and ways of speaking—on the Broadway Jumbotron. In an adaptation of a story about vanity, the actress is playing with nobody but larger-than-life versions of herself.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Would you be into watching a 100-minute I Think You Should Leave sketch? Because that’s basically what Friendship is—a Tim Robinson sketch stretched out way past its welcome. Robinson stars as Craig Waterman, that familiar everyman that Robinson is so good at portraying, a middle-of-the-road dude in literal beige who basically becomes undone by his own squareness. The guest star in this one is Paul Rudd, as hammy as ever as Austin Carmichael, the cheesy-unless-you-don't-know-what's-cheesy weatherman with the hidden hairpiece, the loud band, and the cowboy-kerchief attitude. The premise? Craig seems incapable of making friends while everyone around him—from the jerks at work who can't stop talking about the new Marvel movie he hasn't seen yet, to his wife (straight woman Kate Mara) and son …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am, as a general rule, resistant to blaming a losing team for some sort of moral failing: bowing under pressure or not caring enough or whatever. Largely this is because it ignores the performance of the winning team, and most of the time sports really are as simple as one team playing better than the other. So it is with the skeptic's eye (but still the hater's temptation) that I find myself loath to credit the Maple Leafs' ongoing collapse, from up 2-0 on the Panthers to down 3-2 after a 6-1 shellacking Wednesday night, to some sort of inherent Leafiness. Do I really believe that the tension is too much for successful pro athletes like Auston Matthews, still goalless in the series? Is the second round that much more stressful than the first, in which they seemed fine? Would the most competitive people on Earth really lay a Game 5 stinker because they just happened to not feel like giving full effort that day?
That is for Canadian sports media to discuss all summer, and they will, and it will get very stupid. But I do find my stony resolve cracking a bit when I see what the Leafs themselves had to say about a game in which they allowed six unanswered. "We all need to be better, me included," head coach Craig Berube said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo is real good at getting ejected from a baseball game. A fellow ought to get his dang money's worth; there are too many managers out there—sleepy, retiring types, or the constitutionally frail—who do not or cannot make a truly cinematic moment out of an argument. Fans and players alike appreciate a manager who kicks huge ass. At least one Washington National, for example, is reportedly chafing at the recent passivity of the team's cardiovascularly challenged head guy. Lovullo will not leave his men wanting: When he marches out there, odds are someone is going to take a reaming for the ages. 
And Lovullo, God bless him, doesn't need much of an invitation. Only seven active managers have been tossed more; Lovullo, in his ninth season as a manager, is already in the top-100 all-time, with 22 career ejections. By way of comparison, it took Hall-of-Famer Hughie Jennings 16 seasons to get to 24. Lovullo may not have Bobby Cox's prodigious, historic pace—a fantastic 162 career ejections in 30 seasons—but then this is a different era. As broken down in a 2019 New York Times story, the manager meltdown is considered somewhat déclassé in the modern game. "I tell [today's umpires], 'You guys are lucky you weren’t around 20, 30 years ago," says Reds manager Terry Francona, who has been run just 51 times in 23-plus major-league seasons. Giving a volcanic helping of The Business to those antagonists in the blue shirts was, in earlier times, considered an important part of the job, not just to address umpire performance but to inspire one's own team out of mid-summer ennui.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Natalie Nakase is many things: a 5-foot-2 former walk-on who became the starting point guard for UCLA, a WNBA champion as an assistant coach with the Las Vegas Aces, and “a unifier,” as Golden State Valkyries general manager Ohemaa Nyanin put it in an introductory presser last October. When the Valkyries play their season opener in San Francisco this Friday, Nakase will add to that list, becoming the first head coach of the franchise, and the first Asian-American head coach in WNBA history. She is a third-generation Japanese American from Southern California, raised by a basketball-loving father who kept his daughters in the gym the way some parents bring their children to church.
Basketball has been an integral part of Japanese-American communities on the West Coast since the early 1900s. Shaped by forcible internment during World War II, Japanese-American basketball leagues (colloquially known as the “JA leagues”) flourished for decades as a way to cultivate second- and third-generation talent, and still operate to this day. The use of digital archives dating back to the 1940s, as well as interviews with relatives and members of the JA league community, can demonstrate how the story of Natalie Nakase is the story of Japanese-American basketball. Go through her family history, and you’ll find competition and resilience that transcends the sport itself.]]></summary>
