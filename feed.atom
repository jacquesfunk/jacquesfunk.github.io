        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Greg Gumbel was named host of the CBS NFL pregame show in 1990, he was viewed as a departure for the network. Brent Musberger had been host of The NFL Today for the past 15 years, and a lot of people were tired of his shtick. He dominated the show, and much of the network's sports coverage. Reporters wondered whether Gumbel, who had previously called NFL games and hosted NCAA men’s basketball tournament coverage for CBS, would be another preempting pregame personality.
He wasn’t, instead guiding the show in a lower key. Gumbel hosted in the studio with Terry Bradshaw, while Lesley Visser and Pat O’Brien handled features. The new host wanted to be the conductor, not the star. “If Terry stars on that show,” Gumbel told the AP right before starting, “then I’ll have done my job.”]]></summary>

He said he changed beforehand, putting on a blazer over a button-front shirt. He changed his shoes, too. Crucially, he didn’t change out of the jeans he was wearing.
Carlsen told the Chess YouTube show Take Take Take that he was in a rush to make it to the tournament. He got there in time, but his pants got him into trouble: Jeans are not allowed, per the International Chess Federation's dress code. FIDE said in a statement later that jeans are “explicitly prohibited under long-standing regulations for this event,” adding that the rules are “designed to ensure professionalism and fairness for all participants.”]]></summary>

There is plenty of evidence to suggest that it may also have been the last meaningful basketball game they play in the years to come.
As franchise-breaking losses go, this one was at least a bang, not a whimper. The Kings hosted a hot Pistons team in the midst of an undefeated West Coast road trip, and despite their lone functional big man Domantas Sabonis missing the game with an illness, they built a double-digit lead early in the second quarter and steadily managed it for two quarters. This is what theoretically superior teams do at home against theoretically inferior ones, a dynamic which De'Aaron Fox's poor first half underscored. Down 10 with 3:36 left, Detroit began to mount a fierce resistance, which was enough for the Kings to totally clam up and stop playing anything resembling team basketball.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When F.C. Barcelona acquired Dani Olmo from RB Leipzig back in August, it did so despite clearly not being anywhere close to able to afford Olmo's salary under La Liga's Financial Fair Play rules, which regulate each club's spending relative to its earnings and debts each season, and which Barcelona has been wrestling with for years as a result of years upon years of hideous mismanagement. Olmo wound up missing Barça's first couple of 2024 La Liga matches because the club couldn't register his salary with the league.
Good—or anyway, "good"—fortune came in the form of an Achilles tendon injury to trusty center back Andreas Christensen: In the event of an injury that will keep a given player out for four months or longer, La Liga rules permit a team to spend (and register) up to 80 percent of that player's salary for the purpose of filling the hole in the squad. With Christensen out, Barça got the space it needed to register Olmo, plus young attacker Pau Víctor—but only through the end of December. The club would have until then to benefit from Olmo's and Víctor's services; if by then it hadn't drummed up the additional income or savings it would need in order to extend their registrations through the end of the season, the registrations would expire on Jan. 1, rendering the two players unable to participate in La Liga matches and giving the club until the end of the January transfer window to get them re-registered.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By the time Bram Stoker died in 1912, Dracula remained his most successful and lucrative creation, a crude way of looking at a writer’s corpus but, in this case, informative of what financial circumstances his widow, Florence, was left in and how the property of Dracula was handled. As executor of Stoker’s estate, Florence had sole authorization over Dracula’s usage in any medium, whether stage plays or nascent motion pictures. In 1921, F. W. Murnau and Prana Films, cofounded by producer Albin Grau, had completed a complicated shoot of a German film titled Nosferatu (the production could only utilize one camera, which meant there was only a single negative to work with), a dramatically stark reinterpretation of Dracula released to little fanfare.
Neither Murnau nor Prana sought permission to use elements from Stoker’s most famous novel from Florence, a concern made less straightforward by the regional differences in copyright law but one that Stoker’s widow nonetheless viewed as flagrant plagiarism. Florence, along with the British Society of Authors, soon launched a legal campaign to sue Prana Films for damages. Ultimately, Prana filed for bankruptcy and, in lieu of being able to pay restitution to Florence, relinquished Nosferatu’s rights and all copies of the film to the Stoker estate. The fiasco took about three years and by 1925, Nosferatu’s market value had fallen so steeply that Florence set about trying to destroy as many existing prints of the film as possible. Five years later, Universal bought the rights to Dracula from Florence and reportedly also bought an existing American print of Nosferatu that they then studied for the 1931 adaptation of the novel starring Bela Lugosi. Of course, extant copies of Nosferatu survived in other countries, prominently in France and the U.S., these and other copies shown in revivals and eventually restored throughout the years.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though neither of us were alive during Jimmy Carter’s presidency, when the weather gets cold, my partner and I love to recite to each other in cartoonish voices, “Do what I do: wear a sweater!” I’m not actually sure if Carter ever said these exact words (I’m not finding it in the transcript of his 1977 sweater speech), but they are a potent reminder: In the cold months, your clothes are meant to keep you warm. 
Last year, a piece by Amanda Mull set off weeks of discourse about why sweaters are such poor quality these days. For most of my life, I wore garbage sweaters that barely kept me warm. I’m sure you know this experience, too. The affordable, accessible options are generally so terrible that it’s possible that the majority of sweaters many of us have worn in our lives have been acrylic or some other synthetic material. It's likely many people don’t know how nice and warm it feels to wear a sweater made from materials that aren't garbage.]]></summary>

There are new rules and systems to figure out, a new overall cadence and a bunch of new people, and some number of other, stranger, newer things specific to that workplace that you can't really know about going in. When I was hired at the old site back in 2017, I had been through a couple of previous staff writing jobs and a great many recurrent freelance jobs and more get-me-over bullshit office gigs than I care to remember, and while I believed that would prepare me somewhat for the new job—and it did, sort of—I knew there would be stuff that I did not know how to do. 
That was years ago, now, and I remember worrying at the time that I was too old for it. I don't know that I have ever felt it more acutely than I did during my first appearance on the old podcast, where I joined Drew and Tim Marchman for a spirited round of The Price Is Right: Williams-Sonoma Edition. All those jobs I'd had and lost, the content management systems and corporate cultures I'd sort of figured out, the various flavors of shitty media ownership I'd endured—none of that was any help to me when I was tasked with guessing the price of a champagne saber from that year's catalog. I don't remember how wrong I was with my guess, but I do remember that I have seldom been more wrong about anything.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basketball fans and league officials who were wringing their hands about the NFL encroaching on Christmas woke up on Wednesday to quite the treat. Knicks-Spurs was an incredible opener to an altogether great showcase day of hoops, largely because Victor Wembanyama played one of his best games as an NBA player. In his second game in Madison Square Garden (his first was only his eighth game as a Spur), Wemby went for 42 points, 18 rebounds, six made three-pointers, and four assists. He also had four blocks, though there's no point in emphasizing those, as he's averaging four per game anyway and he had a 10-block game and a seven-block half in his two previous games.
My favorite thing about a Wembanyama highlight is picking out where he is when there's a cut in the video, as it's usually much further out or in a more compromising position than anyone ever is in a clip where they will soon be highlighted. There he is, two players away out near the perimeter as OG Anunoby winds up for a doomed layup attempt, only for him to scythe over and erase it; there he is, lurking near the logo as Tre Jones pulls a three, only to zip in and dunk back the rebound.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Draymond Green…we'll wait a moment while you readjust your underwear…is the last living pre-modern basketball player, a time-traveler from the era when "everyone is just collateral damage to the greater goal" was the predominant philosophy who has arrived in our moment to do the absolute most. Which is why his little tribute to the 1970s, and to a handful of defunct WWE finishing moves, hit the Christmas basketball crowd so intensely. In executing and selling his inspired and illegal double-takedown of two Los Angeles Lakers, Green managed to commit four callable fouls on the same play. It was remarkable, but also just part of a full evening's work on a full day of quality basketball. And he still managed to fit in his normal output—no discernible offense, 10 rebounds, and a technical foul for complaining to referees—in that purely Greenian way of his.
The “four callable fouls” thing is particularly instructive where Green’s eye to the past is concerned. You can almost see Dalton Knecht and Rui Hachimura sensing that something is about to go very amiss for both of them. They both can see that Green is between them, but their main attention is on the rebound they seek. You can definitely see Scott Foster, the referee you love to hate mostly because he's probably the only referee whose name you know, already putting his whistle in his mouth; he's seen this general dynamic since Green became a pro and has the requisite Pavlovian response. None of this really snuck up on anyone, and yet it arrived as a surprise all the same.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Philadelphia 76ers began the season in the toilet, but appear now to have slithered out of the bowl. They have the best record in the NBA since Thanksgiving, in a tie with three teams whose bonafides are for the most part pretty well established. All it took was a run of schedule heavy on the league's bozos—the 76ers have played (and beaten) the Charlotte Hornets three times in 18 days—and a little bit of musculoskeletal good fortune, and today the 76ers find themselves just a game out of the Eastern Conference play-in. The cruddiness of the East makes this not too much of an accomplishment, but the 76ers still hope to make something of this season, and a grip on the back of a breathtakingly sad playoff pack at least gives them reason to keep struggling upward.
Wednesday's 118-114 road win over the festively clad Boston Celtics was a good one. This was just the sixth time all season that Philadelphia has had all of Joel Embiid, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey in the lineup at the same time, and the 76ers are now a respectable 4–2 with their core intact. This is not yet the world-destroying Big Three anyone might've imagined, in part because George and Embiid are still working their way into rhythm and shape, but in 107 minutes of shared court-time the trio has eked out a narrow positive net rating, by holding opposing teams to a suffocated 99.6 points per 100 possessions. Eventually one or more of these very good basketball players will remember how to shoot, and then Philadelphia's important lineups will also thrive, or at least stink a lot less, on the offensive end. For now it's enough to tread water with hellacious defense.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix viewer statistics are notorious lies. Not just in the Nielsen "we're doing a lot of extrapolating" sense, nor even generous but plausible exaggerations. The data is wholly private, the methods proprietary, and the numbers they do choose to leak are immediately laughed down as mathematically absurd. All streamers play fast and loose with this stuff, but Netflix is particularly egregious. They have their ways: When you watch five minutes of a movie and turn it off because it's ass, Netflix multiplies that five minutes by whatever it needs to achieve the total runtime, then by the 16 people who no doubt live in your household, and that's how we end up with things like Red Notice being the most-watched movie on Earth, ever.
The NFL likes to brag about its ratings. This is understandable, because live sports are the only thing that gets decent broadcast ratings anymore, and the NFL is a juggernaut even in that rare air. So when NFL games made their Netflix debut on Christmas Day with a pair of boring blowouts, you knew the bragging would reach new heights. And because there's no third party actually tracking or verifying the numbers, they could just make up some shit. That is presumably what they did, when NFL Media shared some impressive metrics not long after Chiefs-Steelers ended, but they flew a little too close to the sun.]]></summary>

About a year ago now, I decided I wanted to bake bread.
I certainly did not grow up a baker, or even a cook at all: my skills in the kitchen stayed at the young bachelor-standard Kraft Mac/frozen pizza capacity into my early 20s. While my younger sisters were pressed into service at a young age, churning out cookies and brownies and birthday cakes with my mother, I was never called to duty. I was a boy, my sisters were girls. I could try to turn this into a moment of Injustice, yet another example of Young Victoria having a girlhood she didn’t know she wanted preemptively withheld from her; in reality, I was extremely fucking lazy. If I had been invited to participate, I would’ve said “no” and retreated to my room to play Madden.]]></summary>
