        <updated>2025-08-13T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[P.F. Chang's welcomes its new "Freakier Flavors" menu inspired by Disney's recently released Freakier Friday movie. Interestingly enough, the original Freaky Friday included a fictional House of Chiang restaurant (which sounds similar to P.F. Chang's), which the new menu pays tribute to.

P.F. Chang's new Freakier Friday-themed menu includes:


House of Chang's Spicy Chicken Dinner Special - Chang's Spicy Chicken served with white rice and an egg roll.
Mix It Up Mongolian Beef Dinner Special - Mongolian Beef served with white rice or lo mein and a house salad.
Switcheroo Refresher - Mango-orange lemonade that changes color and shimmers.
Crystal Ball Refresher - A mix of desert pear, lemonade, Sprite, and club soda that changes color and shimmers.
Pink Slip Ube Cheesecake - Vanilla cheesecake base topped with a creamy, nutty ube layer, made from purple sweet potato (ube), and topped with edible pink glitter.


The Freakier Flavors menu is available now for a limited time at most P.F. Chang's locations nationwide through September 2, 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Little Caesars is offering a limited-time, online-only deal where you can get a large, two-topping Crazy Crust Pizza for $6.99.

The deal can be redeemed by using the promo code "JUSTCRUSTUS" when ordering through the Little Caesars website or mobile app at participating locations nationwide (except Alaska and Hawaii).
Little Caesars' Crazy Crust is the chain's regular crust brushed at the edge with a buttery-flavored garlic spread and sprinkled with Parmesan (in the same manner as the chain's Crazy Bread).
A large, two-topping Crazy Crust Pizza is normally $11.99 at my local Little Caesars restaurant in Los Angeles.
