        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On June 6, a baby-faced TikTok user named Louis, who adorns his username with two Reichskreuze—the Imperial Cross that’s often used as a neo-Nazi symbol—commented “Saxony Anhalt votes blue,” followed by a blue heart emoji, under politician Alice Weidel’s video urging people to vote AfD, the far-right Alternative for Germany party, for the 2024 EU parliamentary elections. A quick scroll down Louis’s page immediately shows two racist memes, one about Muslims and another about Black people. AfD in Saxony-Anhalt has been officially classified as an extremist group. 
Weidel’s video features an anime-style cartoon of a young man excitedly voting for the AfD. A German flag flashes before the boy’s eyes, making him quiver with joy. The entire comments section is filled with blue hearts, the color of the AfD. The video ends with the hashtag “blue instead of colorful,” referring to a rejection of the “woke madness” that embraces diversity. The youthfulness and playful animation of the video may stand in stark contrast with its deeply hateful message, but its makers know exactly who they’re targeting.]]></summary>

Months ago, Ryan Routh left a letter with a friend in case his assassination attempt failed.
That letter is now in prosecutors' hands, and court filings have made some of its contents public.
What's been released so far makes Routh's political motives clear -- he saw Trump as dangerously unfit for the presidency and a threat to peace.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Washington Nationals made a sudden and alarming roster move on Friday, optioning 23-year-old all-star shortstop C.J. Abrams to their Triple-A team in Rochester. If the Nationals were good—if they were overstocked with primo young hitting talent, like, say, the Baltimore Orioles—it would be possible to slide this move by as an unfortunate consequence of roster crunch. And, indeed, the Orioles also optioned a talented youngster on the same day, sending hulking 22-year-old infielder and reigning organizational Minor League Player of the Year Coby Mayo back to Norfolk, effectively ending his season. Good teams can have reasons for making painful late-season roster moves that are, if not entirely wholesome, at least coherent within the context of a competitive enterprise. This is not that.
The Nationals are not good, and there's no one anywhere in the organization to slide all that comfortably into Abrams's spot in the field or in the lineup. Abrams's demotion is a disciplinary measure: As first reported by Cody Delmendo of CHGO Sports and later confirmed by Jesse Rogers of ESPN, Abrams was seen living it up at a Chicago casino until 8:00 a.m. Friday morning, and then had to suit up for a 2:00 p.m. game against the Cubs that same afternoon. After the game—Abrams went 0-for-3 with a walk in the leadoff spot, in a 3–1 loss—Nationals coach Davey Martinez pulled Abrams into a long and emotional meeting and informed him that his season was over. The Nationals haven't exactly ratted Abrams out, but everything in their tone and demeanor confirms the scoop.]]></summary>

Antonio Pierce was advertised as the franchise’s latest savior, the coach that this historically listless roster would respond to after enduring The Josh McDaniels Experience; with Pierce setting the example, the team would vibrate with joyful devotion to the greater cause. So trusting. So naive. But these are the Raiders, who have talked it while steadfastly refusing to walk it for two full decades and change now. This is an organization that goes from "Hey, who's the new guy?" to "Hey, when are we getting a new guy?" with uncommon swiftness. It's why, since they lost Super Bowl The 37th back in 'Ought Two, Raiders coaches have averaged 26 games between hiring and firing. That's barely a season and a half.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the things that has always been captivating to me about the TV show Alone is how it illustrates our endless capacity for invention in the absolute worst of times. It's a reality show about survival, but really what that means is adaptability. When you lose a supply of arrows, can you fashion more from branches and scavenged parts? Do you know how to use sphagnum moss to treat a wound after an unfortunate ax misadventure? If a crafty vole has raided your stores of fish, will you be able to find more food or resort to gnarly bark-based teas and intermittent fasting as the frost sets in?
It's a manufactured danger. But part of the appeal is that there's no one coming to the rescue. Ultimately you survive and win, or wind up another sucker ferried back to civilization after an intense flirtation with giardia. Either way, these people have to figure out a new way to live every day.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the Premier League's marquee showdown of the weekend, last year's number one and number two faced off in an early clash of titans that already had title implications. Arsenal retooled this summer in order to better pursue Manchester City for a third straight season, bringing in defender Riccardo Calafiori, midfielder Mikel Merino, and forward Raheem Sterling. Sunday was Arsenal's first crack at City this season, and though the visiting side gave up a goal to—who else—Erling Haaland in the ninth minute, the Gunners took control of the match with goals from two defenders: Calafiori tied it up in the 22nd with an incredible rocket from outside the box, and then Gabriel gave Arsenal the lead in the first minute of first half stoppage time with a rising header off a corner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There were some recognizable elements of the Singapore Grand Prix this year: a night race with hot weather, heavy humidity, a dew point no doubt off the charts. Correspondingly, there was tired, occasionally frustrated driving on a street circuit not built for overtakes, though this year they tried to rectify this issue by increasing the total number of DRS zones to four. Four! The saving grace for Singapore has also been its most defining characteristic: its propensity for safety cars. But this year, with some luck and a lot of engine reliability, there was nothing. 
This year's race was won or lost in discrete moments. Ferrari lost it after a horrific qualifying; you can't recover from P9 and P10 on the grid on a track like Singapore. Lewis Hamilton lost it after a call to put him on old soft tires to start the race; he failed to grab the all-important track position on the opening lap, and didn't have the tires to last him to the end. And Lando Norris won it by finally converting pole position to a lap-one lead for the first time so far this season, putting to bed—or, at least, a nap—one of the most persistent criticisms levied at his driving this year.]]></summary>

Nearly as prevalent in my feeds are the de-influencing videos. While influencers work to persuade their audience to buy products they may or may not need in the hopes of getting a few cents of commission, de-influencers remind people why they don’t need to spend their money. De-influencing material ranges from explaining why individual viral products aren't worth buying to entire accounts built to remind audiences that hauls aren't normal and call out undisclosed ads or partnerships with brands. De-influencing is part of a larger populist turn I've noticed in response to the omnipresent commercialization of the social internet, but it also exemplifies one of the internet's signal conundrums: Is it possible to create anticapitalist work on social media?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["No loss is good," said Chicago White Sox interim manager Grady Sizemore, a statement which, rather than defusing the potency of Sunday's milestone loss, merely diffuses it across a season: If no loss is good, then each loss is bad, which means 120 losses are a death march unseen in the days of widespread color TV. That's 120 days of feeling bad at the ballpark; 120 unsatisfied nights, wishing for a better tomorrow that rarely comes. Thirty-six chances for the South Side to stand up, weighed against 120 blunt remonstrances to remain seated.
The 43-119 Detroit Tigers of 2003 are now in the rearview mirror, still notable for possessing the last 20-game loser in Mike Maroth but no longer for owning the AL's worst record of the modern era. The 40-120-1 New York Mets of 1962 are next up. One of the first expansion teams, before MLB had balanced its expansion rules to avoid putting out true stinkers, those Mets were wretched but charmingly pitiable, like an Instagram chihuahua. They made their own manager ask, "Can't anybody here play this game?" They were and are baseball's touchstone for terrible. And they were a better team than the 2024 Chicago White Sox.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the end of the first quarter of their opening playoff game against the Las Vegas Aces, the Seattle Storm couldn't have found themselves in a much better position. They were leading 18-9, having held the Aces to just 11 percent shooting from the field. Unanimous MVP A'ja Wilson, who had just received her trophy in a pregame ceremony, was 1-of-8. The Storm were cooking.
If a blueprint exists for Seattle getting past Vegas in this best-of-three first-round matchup, it looks a lot like what happened in that first quarter. The Storm, always a defense-first unit, were playing with an intensity and speed that totally discombobulated the Aces' offense. Even without defensive anchor Ezi Magbegor, Seattle's collection of defensive hawks were switching and sliding and blitzing fast enough to make Wilson and the Aces look slow and ponderous. Every shot at the rim was contested, and Seattle's traps and rotations fired so quickly that they looked less like a basketball team scrambling to cover the court than a well-drilled soccer team executing a perfect counter-press.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Through the better part of three quarters of football on Sunday afternoon, the Philadelphia Eagles and New Orleans Saints were locked in a world's ugliest dog contest. Just one week earlier the Saints were rolling over the haunted remains of the Cowboys and everyone got a piece of the action; Alvin Kamara got four touchdowns, quarterback Derek Carr threw for 243 yards and two touchdowns and even got in on a QB sneak on the way to a 44-19 win. 
On Sunday they led 3-0 thanks to an early field goal and Eagles coach Nick Sirianni's commitment to salvaging genius from ineptitude. The birds had three blown fourth downs early in the game: a blocked punt, a Jalen Hurts sack after a too many men on the field penalty, and a busted run play at the end of the first half in place of an easy field goal.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fifty-three points. That's how much Sun Belt juggernaut James Madison University had at halftime against the University of North Carolina on the way to a 70-50 blowout. But that final score does no justice to the absolute ass beating that the Dukes conveyed in Saturday's matchup.
That 53 points scored in a half is the most points James Madison has ever scored in one half and the most points North Carolina has ever allowed in a half. It's also the most points a power conference team has given up to a Group of 5 team since 2012. James Madison forced four turnovers, including a pick-six and a blocked punt return for a touchdown in just the first half. The Dukes notched five turnovers in total and for added measure—or humiliation—recovered their own surprise onside kick. James Madison quarterback Alonza Barnett III finished the game with seven total touchdowns, breaking the record for most touchdowns by a Dukes quarterback in a single game, going 22-for-34 and 388 total yards, adding two touchdowns off 64 yards on the ground.]]></summary>

This isn't atypical for me, particularly this season, but what is unusual is how many others seemed to be watching alongside me based on social media. That's the thing about the Colorado Buffaloes, despite how average they are, people can't stop watching. We're all waiting for something: an implosion, an explosion on the field, a rapper on the sideline, two of the best players in college football, or the Deion reaction cam and postgame presser bait. Most importantly, we're watching to see if they win or if they lose.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It wasn’t long ago that the Liberty were down bad. In 2017, owner James Dolan kicked the Liberty out of Madison Square Garden and sent them to the Knicks’ G-League arena in White Plains, New York, where they played in front of crowds that you would expect at a rural high school basketball game. The roster fell apart and between 2018 and 2022 they won 47 of 158 games.  
What a difference a change in ownership makes. In 2019, Dolan sold the team to Joseph and Clara Wu Tsai, who moved the Liberty to Brooklyn in 2021. They immediately got to work turning New York into a WNBA super team, plucking MVP winners Breanna Stewart and Jonquel Jones out of free agency, teaming them up with 2020 No. 1 overall pick Sabrina Ionescu and champion point guard Courtney Vandersloot. The results in 2023 were everything they could have expected in the regular season. The Liberty’s quad-star lineup went 32-8 and they outscored opponents by an average of 8.6 points per game.]]></summary>

Many of the reasons are obvious: Biles is the greatest gymnast of all time, she comes off as cool as hell in interviews, she threw an Instagram funeral for her history-making vault, and she has stood up against both athlete abuse and also her haters. But now add this to the list: She's the reason video evidence exists that might be key to Jordan Chiles getting her bronze Olympic medal restored. 
A little refresher: Chiles competed in the floor competition in Paris this summer, and her preliminary score put her in fifth. Afterward, one of her coaches, Cecile Landi, challenged her score. It worked; after reviewing one element of Chiles's routine, a Gogean, the judges bumped up Chiles's difficulty score by 0.1, which put Chiles in third place and pushed Romanian athlete Ana Barbosu down to fourth.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Media reporter Oliver Darcy broke the astonishing news late Thursday night that star New York political correspondent Olivia Nuzzi had been suspended by the magazine after she disclosed to the magazine that she'd engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a subject of her reporting. That subject, according to several reports, is none other than failed presidential candidate and notable animal corpse defiler Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was the subject of a November 2023 Nuzzi profile.
Per a statement from New York's comms department, Nuzzi has been placed on leave while the magazine conducts a third-party review. Nuzzi told Darcy after his story broke that "earlier this year, the nature of some communication" between herself and a subject "turned personal." She said the relationship was "never physical but should have been disclosed to prevent the appearance of a conflict." In a note to New York staff, editor David Haskell said Nuzzi, 31, claimed not to have used Kennedy, 70, as a source during their relationship, which started in December 2023 and ended in August. Kennedy's people denied the existence of such a relationship and merely told Darcy, "Mr. Kennedy only met Olivia Nuzzi once in his life for an interview she requested, which yielded a hit piece."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The National Football League rarely displays a sense of humor on any topic, largely because the people who run the sport are 74 years old going on 103. People that old and rich are rarely amused, and even more infrequently amusing. Any attempt by this cohort to understand what people less comfortable and death-adjacent consider funny would, ironically enough, be pretty amusing.
Thus the news-to-be that Derek Carr, the FDA's most effective over-the-counter antidote to cool, is going to be fined $14,000 for a) celebrating the New Orleans Saints' pivotal fifth touchdown in a 44-19 thrashing of the Dallas Cowboys, and b) using a vintage Michael Jackson dance move to do it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sunset Rubdown was a shooting star. The band began as a solo project for Spencer Krug's bedroom recordings, and expanded into one of the weirdest, densest, most essential bands of the late 2000s. As one of Wolf Parade's vocalists and creative forces, Krug was already building some buzz for himself as a vital voice in the burgeoning indie rock moment, but he had too many ideas for even that once-prolific band. That's where Sunset Rubdown came in.
Following the project's solo and lo-fi debut album, 2005's Snake's Got A Leg, the band released as strong a trilogy of albums as any act to come out of the music-blog era. Shut Up I Am Dreaming, from 2006, was the breakout, landing on year-end best-of lists, thanks to its simultaneously glittering, brooding, and claustrophobic sound, and its expansive instrument collages. As an aside, this is where I hopped aboard the Sunset Rubdown train, having heard the album shortly into my first semester of college a year after its release. For someone only just starting to broaden his musical horizons, Shut Up I Am Dreaming was a sledgehammer to the brain. (I mean that as a compliment.)]]></summary>

In Worcester, where I grew up, St. John’s and St. Peter’s played each other at the end of every football season for almost a century. It was the longest-running Catholic high-school rivalry in the country. They played every Thanksgiving morning at Fitton Field, the home ground of the Holy Cross Crusaders, about whom more anon.
The two schools had stood as monuments to the massive Irish diaspora to Worcester of which my family was a part. I went to St. Peter’s for elementary school and to St. John’s for high school. St. John’s moved to the suburbs in 1959, which turned out to be a fateful move for both schools and fatal for their rivalry. St. Peter’s stayed in Worcester, but it merged with a girls’ high school and became St. Peter-Marian. St. John’s gradually grew beyond St. Peter’s in every way, including in its football program. The two schools ended the rivalry with their 95th meeting in 2019. St. John’s won, 35-12.]]></summary>

He is Bill Brasky in spikes. This year, a one-way year as he recovers from Tommy John surgery, he just up and decided to double his previous stolen base high, because I guess he was bored not pitching. Sure, why not. Next year he might play goal for the Kings. It feels just as realistic. He makes baseball seem like a matter of willpower. If you can dream it, he might do it, and he might do the undreamt too. The 50/50 club—50 home runs, 50 stolen bases—was not a thing. No one was in it. Those are two very different skills, and guys who hit for power don't tend to run well, and vice versa. Whatever. Ohtani did it. I think he can do anything.
Except be patient, perhaps. When he joined the 40/40 club last month, 21 games faster than anyone had ever done so, he said he felt relief, as all the pending pomp was getting in the way of the thing he really wants to do: step into the box and hit the dang ball. “It was something I wanted to get over as soon as possible because the balls were being exchanged every time I was up to bat," he said.]]></summary>

Harris, with an eye on polls showing young voters not as pro-Democratic as in the past, has been talking about providing $25,000 for down payments to first-time homebuyers. With an eye on young families and single parents, she has also called for restoring part of the refundable child tax credit that was part of what...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump have not clarified the Democratic position on whether that Republican represents an existential threat to democracy. The White House still calls him a threat. Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, has mostly discarded that talking point.
Trump wants it to stop either way. At least, when directed towards him.
"It is time to stop the lies, stop the hoaxes, stop the smears, stop the lawfare or the fake lawsuits against me, and stop claiming your opponents will turn America into a dictatorship. Give me a break," the Republican...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Aug. 2012, a left-wing MSNBC afficionado named Floyd Lee Corkins armed himself with a handgun and extra magazines. He drove to the Washington, D.C., headquarters of the socially conservative Family Research Council, planning to shoot it up. Corkins, who later cited the Southern Poverty Law Center for the proposition that the FRC is an "anti-gay" organization, was also carrying 15 Chick-fil-A sandwiches, which he hoped to stuff in his dead victims' mouths. Corkins, who served as a volunteer at a local LGBT community center, was stopped by an unarmed security guard.

After two assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump, security is tight near the Vance home in Del Ray, the upscale, family-friendly neighborhood that leans very much to the left.
There are security barriers and men and women in uniforms. Neighbors who have talked to the press understand. The Secret Service "is doing what they need to do," Del Ray resident Erica Toler told ALXnow. "We look forward to getting our park back in a few months."

The other day on CNN, Democrat strategist Elliot Williams defended Democrat claims that Donald Trump is a "threat to democracy" because of Trump's refusal to accept election results. Hillary Clinton, Stacey Abrams and every Democrat who thinks George W. Bush stole the 2000 election from Al Gore get a pass. But Trump is a threat to democracy. Democrats get to lie, and the media blesses their lies as truth.

Once Trump wrapped up his rant, Linsey Davis, one of the ABC News moderators, "fact-checked" the former president, helpfully noting that "there is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born."
If Trump had been better prepared, he could have pointed out that a senator named Kamala Harris, while running for president in 2020, opposed legislation that would have...]]></summary>

Harris seems unwilling or unable to answer any impromptu question that she has not been previously prepped for. Her answers at the debate were memorized and canned. They never addressed the questions asked.
Her single, 11-minute post-debate Philadelphia interview was a shipwreck of dodging and dissimulating -- even though the host was sympathetically left-wing.
