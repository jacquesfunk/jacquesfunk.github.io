But there was no laughter. Not from her, Travis (her boyfriend of two-ish years), or Jason (her boyfriend of two-ish years’ older brother). This was in fact her first appearance on a podcast. And over its 104-minute runtime, I was begrudgingly in its grim, peculiar thrall, watching both a version of Swift I was prepared to see—the ruthless, narrative-driven capitalist—and one that repeatedly surprised me: a funny, frequently dull late-thirties girlie who woul…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always struggled with the idea of a "guilty pleasure." Truly innocent pleasure shouldn't come with a side of shame. Most guilty pleasures are purposely private, indulged alone or among the friends who are safe enough to confide in. There are adults who skip social obligations to play video games in their underwear all day. People devote weeks of their lives to hilariously deranged dating shows—The Ultimatum, Love Is Blind, Married at First Sight, and Love Island—but engage in cultural discourse only when it's around something more acceptably "meaningful," like books or politics. There are those who obsess over their frenemies' social media, but love to declare at parties, "I don't really use Instagram anymore."
A guilty pleasure is something you genuinely enjoy but might die before admitting to, simply because it doesn't align with the image of "good taste" you've imagined—or spent time curating—for yourself. The guilt isn't moral—it's not wrong to enjoy the thing—but it's socially contextual. It's not that you shouldn't enjoy it; it's that someone you've deemed cooler, wiser, or more informed might judge you for doing so.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On a breezy spring night in 2023, the Georgia Room at the Freehand Hotel was humid with sweat. Queers of various genders wore cowboy hats and bedazzled denim, camouflage and American flag bikinis. The lights were low and clubby. A New York Times reporter milled around with a notepad. This was Stud Country, a queer line dancing night that began in Los Angeles but had begun migrating, every month or two, to New York. The hosts, Sean Monaghan and Bailey Salisbury, began the night by teaching a line dance to “Texas Time” by Keith Urban, an Australian man singing about his need to be in the Lone Star State, at least energetically: “New York girls, they can be so pretty / But I get cold living in the city.” This campy geographical incongruity felt fitting for an event hosted in a chain boutique hotel in Manhattan. 
When a friend floated the ticket link in the group chat, it sounded right up my alley: I’m an insufferable Brooklyn bisexual who took 12 years of ballet and spent every Sunday of my childhood performing onstage. I went to a Southern state school for college, so country radio imprinted itself on me before my brain was fully formed. Eight counts in, I was hooked. Gay line dancing is nothing new, but it’s a thrilling community to dive into. It was exciting to have a queer space that’s gender-diverse and not particularly boozy. Plus, country music isn’t so far from drag: All those big trucks, cold beers, boat parties, and jilted lovers wear the patina of cliché with a wink.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once upon a time, in a different life, I was tasked with running a blog vertical devoted entirely to help men, who read a sports site, become slightly better at life. Not exceptional. Not great. Not even very good. Just—adequate. We gave advice on anything and everything—cooking, grooming, relationships. We weighed in on matters surrounding identity, etiquette, culture, and taste. People who love to give advice usually don’t find it very difficult to deliver. The real trick, however, was stretching it into the “ideal” 500-750 words—enough to satisfy search engine algorithms, and to justify giving the advice in the first place.
Most of the time it was worthwhile—often nuanced and sometimes even emotionally taxing. We tackled the real, complicated stuff: grief, dating, sex, parenting, workplace politics, even the art of perfecting a family recipe. Other times, it was completely absurd—a way for people who love to talk to keep talking, whether about their mustaches or favorite tomatoes or whatever else.
Now that blog is dead, and the search engines have been rendered useless by AI. So, in tribute, I asked some friends from back then—friends of Defector, too—to share a little unwarranted advice of their own. Nothing overwrought, I told them. No long tirades. Just give me a tip.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I listen to new music, one of the biggest influences I hear—both in the sound and the choices of samples—is video games. Specifically, the games and sounds I remember hearing constantly while I was growing up. There's Pi’erre Bourne’s skittering, glitchy "power up"-style instrumentals and sound effects, and Pinkpantheress’ unmistakable Sonic Adventure 2 vibe. Playboi Carti's outer-space pocket, flickering rhymes, and ad-libs make him feel like a walking arcade game soundtrack. Listen closely and you'll notice that gamer culture is all over the best music being made today.
Sometimes, that influence is direct and obvious—full of digital cartoon effects and bright electro-pop that sounds straight out of Dance Dance Revolution. Other times, it's more subtle, capturing the emotional residue of growing up playing these games. The nostalgia is channeled through ethereal textures—sounds that evoke Sega Dreamcast, the old PlayStation loading screen, or blur into something that feels like a half-remembered dream. Alex G and Mk.gee have a gift for this kind of sonic memory—their songs can feel like a lost afternoon on the N64 as you wait for your crush to get on AOL Instant Messenger.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At some point in the thick of the pandemic, I became briefly obsessed with a silly-seeming online controversy over what is known as the double-beat theory. The argument concerns classical music, which normally would’ve been enough for me to move along, prestissimo, but those were not normal times. By the third or fourth video I watched, I was fully invested in an argument I barely understood about a kind of music I rarely consumed. 
The stakes couldn’t have been lower. The double-beat discourse, such as it was, unfolded in the nested replies of comments sections, one side sneering at the “single-beaters,” the other invoking flat-earthers, each lamenting the other’s tendency toward ad hominem attacks, and on and on and on. Polemics were delivered via YouTube—monologue after self-shot monologue that seemed to borrow its mise en scène and cast from an old VHS dating service, the men drifting in and out of focus on their farty ergonomic chairs, all the accents of the Western Europe professoriat on hand, each finding its own exciting path through words like “ludicrous" and “contemptible.”]]></summary>

And so, for the 48th time, his devoutest followers are gathering in Memphis for a week of concerts and various other events commemorating the King—who'd be 90 years old were he still alive. Cleary there’s still some juice to squeeze out of the King’s carcass: tickets for Monday’s tour of Elvis’s big house—hosted by one of his last girlfriends, Linda Thompson—sold out at $7,000 per set of four.
I’ve been among the memorializers. Of the many rock and roll pilgrimages I’ve taken through the years, none combined irreverent and reverent quite like my 1990 trip to what was then commonly called “Death Week” before Elvis Presley Enterprises rebranded the tribute with the far less metal moniker, "Elvis Week."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2018, Mitski released her fifth album, Be the Cowboy. She had been putting out music that was as critically acclaimed as anything in the American indie world, and promoting it in the only way that still seemed to work: by going on tour. But with Be the Cowboy, the buzz reached a fever pitch. Tours sold out mid-size venues across the country, and her career reached a new peak, prompting reflection about where it might go next. Was there still room to grow, or would the next album cycle mean diminishing returns? Was she destined for back-to-back tours for the rest of her life?
The record’s standout was “Nobody,” a succinct, disco-inflected tune that was primed to be a crossover hit—catchy and danceable but still possessing what the kids are calling "aura," like "Lovefool" by The Cardigans did back in the '90s. This was late in the 2010s, and Mitski was far from the first artist on an independent label to take a swing at making a crossover single with mass appeal. Sadly, radio did not take notice. A 2019 New York Times interview with the program director for ALT 92.3, described as "New York City's only contemporary rock station," helped to explain Mitski's predicament. Alternative stations that, theoretically, might have been playing "Nobody" were chasing an audience that skewed male, and program directors were so worried about alienating that audience that they weren't even playing major label stars like Billie Eilish amid the typical runs of songs by Bastille or Walk the Moon. What hope did an independent artist like Mitski have?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blackpink is the biggest global group in K-pop. With BTS on hiatus and NewJeans in the midst of a prolonged contract dispute, they don't have much competition, so long as they stay active themselves. Yet their current world tour carries a title that suggests an endpoint: Deadline. Two years after renewing their contracts as a group, they have released a new single, "Jump," in their signature style but with a heavier beat, and embarked on what may be their final arena-sized project together. The tour, which runs from July through January, includes 31 stadium shows over 16 cities, with even four stops in Europe, often neglected by K-pop acts. One month in, and they have had no issues selling out stadiums, sometimes doing so twice, and have even catered to local sports fans, launching merchandise collaborations with Mitchell & Ness and Paris Saint-German.
It is commonly understood that individual success jeopardizes the longevity of a group. Justin Timberlake became the breakaway star of NSYNC; it's possible younger fans of Beyoncé don't know more than one Destiny's Child song; One Direction—the biggest boy band in the world—made a multi-hyphenate pop idol out of Harry Styles. In K-pop, individual success is just one threat to a band's sustainability. Few groups survive past the industry's standard (and dreaded) seven-year initial contract term, and those who do often see new releases, referred to in K-pop as "comebacks" more as fan service endeavors than a meaningful return. Members may be lost to mandatory military service or, historically, Chinese members leaving, and scheduling is catered around solo ventures that are more popular or simply less grueling for the individuals.]]></summary>

Early on, a wall carries a list of the laws that made up the apartheid system: 148 different measures spanning 22 years, a constant process of repression and escalation. 
A little further on, there's a series of personal passbooks on display, turned to various pages. The particular one that brought me up short was opened to the spaces where the passbook holder was required to get their employer's signature every month.

No, what I had was clinical depression's cuter, more manageable cousin: seasonal affective disorder. I bought one of those lamps that is too bright for the afternoon darkness but alleges to make your brain think you are standing in warm, direct sunlight. I took vitamin D pills. I whined about how it was too dark and too cold and blamed my brain's rebellion against me on both.
It was easier to confine the bad feelings to a season. I had just moved from Texas to Washington, D.C., a place with real (if mild) winter. Everyone else was struggling, too! It's much more manageable to accept that you have a seasonal setback than it is to worry about a looming lifelong struggle.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a scene in the new Superman movie that illustrates the precarious nature of music compatibility and how touchy it can get. Lois Lane (you know her, played by Rachel Brosnahan) and Clark Kent (David Corenswet), a.k.a. Superman, have a heated argument about their differences: She’s a reporter; he’s a bionic being from another planet. It all unfolded through the lens of rock, and the scene became viral for a reason.
In the middle of their conflict, Lois mocks Clark’s taste, calling herself just a “punk-rock kid from Bakerline.” He insists he’s punk rock too, citing the fictional pop-punk band Mighty Crabjoys and the real nu-metal band P.O.D. She shuts him down: “Those are pop radio bands. They’re not punk rock. The Mighty Crabjoys suck.” Clark replies, mildly wounded: “Well, a lot of people love ’em.” I couldn’t help but wonder … is this just banter, or foreshadowing for this mismatched couple’s inevitable breakup? (You’ll have to watch the movie. It’s great.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is easy enough to read about the climate crisis through the dozens of devastating stories that run each week, warning us of the people who will be displaced or otherwise harmed by the planet's rapidly rising temperatures. It is also easy to feel the climate crisis, through escalating summer heatwaves and the choking smog of wildfire smoke, and to see it in photos of emaciated polar bears and other species at risk of going extinct. But can we hear the climate crisis?
The most obvious answer to this question, I think, is less about what we hear than what we no longer hear. In North America, 389 species of birds face an increased risk of extinction from rising temperatures. Around the world, 40 percent of all insect species have declined dramatically and may go extinct in the next few decades. Amphibians are the most threatened vertebrates, and two percent of the world's amphibians are already being pushed past their physiological limits of heat. Fewer birds mean more muted mornings, fewer insects mean quieter choruses of crickets and cicadas, and fewer amphibians muffle the evening bellows of mating frogs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I finally get Midnights. I don’t just mean, “Oh, I thought this album was whatever when I first heard it, and now I really love it,” though I do mean that a little bit. I mean I get it get it. Like, I get how Taylor Swift concert tickets are as pricey as diamond rings. I get why people freak out about her every single move. I understand the compulsion to puzzle through complicated interpretations of each public missive. I get it because my relationship to this specific kind of average-white-girl pop music has fundamentally changed—not just with Taylor, but with Sabrina Carpenter, Gracie Abrams, Tate McRae, and the other women who appear on algorithmic playlists with titles like “Summer Hits” and “Mood Booster.” My embrace of this music helps to explain how I’m living through what is simultaneously the happiest and the scariest time of my life to date. I’m still figuring out what to do about it.
Earlier this year, I met a man and fell in love for the first time in my life. As I saw friends—primarily cishet friends—share that most human of feelings, I felt anxious about if it would ever happen for me, as if I was too cold or closed-off or broken to deserve someone who would hold my hand on the train home, or whatever. I think all trans women are subliminally told that there has to be something wrong with anyone who’s into them. Even though I’d spent the last several years carving out valuable friendships and a fulfilling day-to-day life, I don’t think I’d ever had a sexual encounter with a guy where I came away feeling like he even respected me. My experiences had made me really question—for the first time since I was about 14—if I even liked men at all.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That’s right. It’s Puja Week and I’m Puja—everyone has to do what I say, or else. Don’t worry, this isn’t my first rodeo. A decade ago, I was a culture editor at the Gawker Media version of Deadspin and worked with many of the writers and editors who make up Defector today. Back then, my remit was “anything but sports,” which meant navigating what I liked to call “a wide variety of balls” in pursuit of more entertaining and earnest fare. My time with those people—and with my colleagues across our sister sites—was one of the most ridiculously fun and journalistically bold stretches of my career. It shaped me as an editor and reporter, and it’s where I met some of my closest friends and favorite bloggers. It feels good to be here with some of them again. 
If I sound nostalgic, it’s because I’m writing this in August. While “Puja Week” is meant to be synonymous with “Music Week”—I left Deadspin to run Spin, and more recently helmed Pitchfork—it’s equally a tribute to the hangover of the year, that liminal period where the last drops of summer freedom are wrung out in anxious, existential anticipation of the coming seasonal chill. August is a month of spiritual and climatic dissonance. Over the next few days, you’ll see writing to match—reflective, feelings-forward, sentimental, brooding, occasionally needling at past, present, and future. Expect essays (and playlists) about life’s transitional periods—exploring love, identity, family, and emotional regulation—lists that wrestle with liking and hating something at once, and surveys of the shifting pockets of the music industry and their current cultural cachet.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many who have loved and left New York City, I dearly miss the transportation setup there. The walkability, the trains, the buses—there's not another town in the U.S. where you can do so much (and get so far) easily and without needing a car of your own. Though my 16-year-old self would have scarcely believed it, those years on the subway convinced me of the superiority of life without a car. Even though I look back fondly at my days as a straphanger, my return to the driver's world has reminded me of an undeniable truth: Riding around in the car while blaring music you love is the absolute shit.
Few pleasures in life can match the joy I feel when I plop into the driver's seat, queue up an album, pull out of the driveway, and embark on a medium-length drive while shouting lyrics and mangling melodies. The bliss of bobbing my head and contorting my face, throwing around my hands and popping my shoulders, lets me attain that uninhibited state otherwise reserved for when I'm  certain nobody is watching... or when I'm too inebriated to care. I don't think it's a coincidence that I’ve been listening to way more music since leaving NYC. There, podcasts seemed like a more fitting soundtrack to my daily commute, due to the sonic inferiority of my cheap earbud headphones and my self-conscious refusal to come off like an especially terrible Showtime act if I grooved to my music there the same way I do in private. I can't say that my rekindled passion for listening to new music in the car is an even trade for walking or riding the subway instead of driving. But it does come pretty damn close.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elena Rybakina must have figured she had the match won. She’d just battered 18-year-old Victoria Mboko in a 25-shot rally late in their Montreal semifinal, sending her sprinting from corner to corner until Mboko’s desperate lob drifted long. Mboko hunched over in exhaustion afterwards, her racket pressed hard into the ground as a crutch. Losing a miserable point like this, reminiscent of the godforsaken PACER test, typically comes with a hangover. The fatigued player often pulls the cord early in the rally in a desperate bid to get their breath back and misses by a mile, or produces a meatball drop shot. The score here was tied—4-all in the do-or-die third-set tiebreak—but Rybakina had all the momentum and a seemingly significant fitness advantage. 
So I thought. At 4-all, Mboko clobbered four forehands, but coherently rather than desperately. The last one tagged the sideline for a winner. Mboko grabbed the next two points as well to win the match, leaving my tennis logic in tatters. Rybakina’s epic rally just a minute earlier had somehow worked against her, proving the last point she would win rather than the boon I’d expected. That wasn’t Mboko’s only miracle act of the match: She’d saved a match point half an hour earlier. This proved too much for my Tennis Channel stream, which promptly buckled under the tension and crashed. Mboko broke serve to prolong the match twice, outlasting both Rybakina and TC’s notorious technical difficulties.]]></summary>

It is so rare that anything is happening on the phone. About 99 percent of the time, the other person says "nothing," and puts their phone down. I see this in people in every generation.

Because they are cut in two by our ad break, it is easy enough to mentally divide them; because they all begin with Drew's signature skronking vocal overture, they all have a shape. But what does it mean, really, to say that something like half of a podcast is given over to soda-related discourse, and that the other component parts are about going to a Marlins game, the demi-crisis in WNBA officiating, and also a frank discussion about the frustration of duffing the preparation of a familiar recipe? You can put all that together and reach 100 percent of a podcast and 63 minutes, but also those things do not, on their face, fit together at all. I realize that. And yet:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Josh Naylor is slow. Not slow in the way that catchers are considered slow by default, or how some tall lanky guys seemingly can't get their legs moving, or even slow in the way that Kyle Schwarber is. Josh Naylor is third-percentile sprint speed slow. Josh Naylor is the 16th-slowest guy in baseball, and the third-slowest first baseman—he'll beat Triston Casas and Rowdy Tellez in a footrace, but if you put him against a fast shortstop like Trea Turner, he's never winning.
But if you're only counting stolen bases, it's a different story. Turner currently has 25 stolen bases this year, on pace for a very respectable 35-steal season. He has been caught stealing six times, for a roughly 80 percent success rate, which satisfies the heuristic—though it is only a heuristic—of the 70 percent breakeven point. Not shabby at all! Bobby Witt Jr. has 30 stolen bases on the season and has been caught stealing seven times, for a roughly 81 percent success rate. Again, that's about what you'd expect. Meanwhile, Naylor has 21 stolen bases on the season and has been caught stealing only twice, for an absurd 91 percent success rate. Those are Oneil Cruz numbers, with the caveat that Cruz has attempted to steal 15 more times than Naylor.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tom Brady may be incredibly famous, obscenely successful, and (formerly?) outrageously handsome, but he has never been cool. This is a plain fact, one that Patriots fans like myself overlooked during his tenure there and one that Patriots haters loved to mock him for. Since his retirement, Brady has lost the magnetic appeal of his abilities with the ball in his hands, which has made stark his absent coolness. His commentary stint has been mediocre at best and awful at worst, and his unwavering but erroneous belief in his own charm is fully insufferable without the touchdowns and wins to mask it. In place of any kind of recognizably human personality, there is nothing but coach speak and corporate speak and brand consciousness, which makes it close to impossible for him to forge any kind of connection with an audience when he's not wearing pads. That hasn't stopped him from trying, which brings us to soccer.
Built in Birmingham: Brady & The Blues is the latest attempt to humanize and propagandize Brady, and in a perverse way it succeeds at painting what feels like a true portrait of the former quarterback-turned-commentator-and-owner. This is not to say that the show succeeds in making Brady a compelling figure, or even a sympathetic one. Instead, the show—which is terrible for a variety of reasons, almost all Brady-related—proves what has been obvious for years: post-football Tom Brady is nothing but a platitude-spouting Robotron incapable of self-awareness.]]></summary>

Like the Grand Slams of tennis, the Grand Smashes sit atop WTT’s tournament hierarchy, and with $1.55 million in prizes and main draws of 64 top players, the Smash was the largest international table tennis event to take place in the United States.
Vegas is no stranger to big table tennis tournaments. The city often plays host to the U.S. Open, which is run by USA Table Tennis and features a handful of pros competing side by side with hundreds of amateurs. American players who have been to previous U.S. Opens arrived at the Grand Smash already familiar with the little hells that a tournament in Vegas can produce: blast-furnace heat and slot machine-choked hotels on the way to a convention center floor, undergirded by concrete so slick that players pour out drinking water to wet their soles between points.]]></summary>

Well, you don't throw him your 103.9-mph fastball; you dissolve him with your slider. That's how Mason Miller was able to begin his ninth-inning save on Wednesday night.
The Padres' big deadline add from not-Oakland was in the news for the wrong reason after Tuesday's game, when Diamondbacks DH Lourdes Gurriel Jr. tied the score in the eighth by making Miller's flameball the fastest pitch ever homered on (probably ever, but at least since they started keeping track of those things in 2008). San Diego recovered to win in extra innings, but it was hard to forget the fact that Miller's searing heat had been made to look so vincible.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone who ever met Wavy Dave and lived to tell the tale—which is, in point of fact, everyone who has ever met Wavy Dave—would tell you about his claw. It was big, that's for certain, but this was not unusual for male fiddler crabs, which wield one enormous front claw, much larger than its counterpart. This is what gets the the female fiddlers going: a large claw that can wave back and forth quickly; the kind of claw that sends a message. These major claws can comprise more than 30 percent of a male's total body mass, which is a big burden on such a little crab. But if a female likes the size and motion of a male's claw, she may enter his burrow and let him fertilize her eggs.
But Wavy Dave's large claw, according to those who've seen it, kept growing larger. On the first day he scuttled into town, his claw was nearly two inches from base to tip. But the next time he came 'round these parts, his claw was even bigger. If you'd had gotten close enough to measure it, you'd find it had grown to a whopping 2.7 inches, making it the largest major claw on record for the species Afruca tangeri. You might think twice before crossing Wavy Dave.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is perhaps unfair to the rest of humanity to slot Alan Dershowitz in as a specific type of guy. He fits into a number of variously rancid cohorts: Inner Circle Jeffrey Epstein Associates; Celebrity Attorneys (Derogatory); People With "Harvard" As Their Personality; People With "Actually I Have Voted Democratic" As Their Personality; Podcaster. But the category into which he fits the most cleanly is more abstruse, and has less to do with anything Dershowitz has done or the (many) scary monsters and super-creeps that he has represented, than the way that Dershowitz himself is, and the uniquely grating hazard he represents.
So while it is true that Alan Dershowitz is quite literally someone who got into a huffy argument with a pierogi vendor at a farmer's market on Martha's Vineyard, was escorted from the premises by police, and subsequently threatened a lawsuit, it is also and more significantly true that Alan Dershowitz is exactly the sort of person who would do all those things, to the point where my first reaction upon hearing this news was trying to remember whether this was the first time he'd done it. And while I can now confirm that this was Dershowitz's first pierogi-specific Martha's Vineyard contretemps—as I was writing this, there was a second—there have been enough other things like it that it was a reasonable enough thing to be confused about. Give or take going on TV whenever anyone asks and writing books with titles like The Price Of Principle: Why Integrity Is Worth The Consequences, Guilt By Association: The Challenge Of Proving Innocence In The Age Of #MeToo, and Palestinianism: The Newest Attack On Peace And Human Rights And Democracy, this is just how Dershowitz spends his time—getting into weird public disputes and treating himself to outlandish takings of umbrage re: his seemingly very unhappy experience on Martha's Vineyard, where he has vacationed for 50 years, and then threatening lawsuits and recording emergency episodes of his delightfully named podcast, The Dershow, about it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh yeah, Cameron Brink! The Los Angeles Sparks’ No. 2 pick in 2024 last played in the WNBA over a year ago, when she tore her ACL in the first quarter of a game against the Sun. There's not really a convenient time for a torn ACL, but the timing of this one was rough: The injury happened just weeks before she was set to go to the Paris Olympics as a member of the U.S. 3x3 basketball team, an opportunity that once delighted her to the point of tears. It also cut short a promising rookie season in which she’d looked like she’d soon be among the best defensive players in the league. 
In the final days of July, some thrilling news popped up on the Sparks' injury report: Brink was upgraded from “out” to “doubtful” before a road game against the Liberty. The next game, against the Aces, she was “in.” She returned to play this month to fill a Defensive Player of the Year-sized hole on a talented but incomplete Sparks roster. On the very outside of the playoff picture with a 13-15 record, Los Angeles has heated up but could very much use some help from their young franchise star.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are more intricate ways to measure a pitcher's talent and effectiveness than the digits on a radar gun, but none quite so visceral. The Padres acquired Mason Miller from the California Athletics because of the fact that he strikes out an absurd number of hitters on his fastball/slider combo. That fastball, however, is thrilling just on its own terms, because Miller throws it an average of 101 miles per hour. When you see a pitcher with that kind of cannon, watching the radar readings becomes its own sort of sport: Can he top 102? Can he do it again? Since every fan has traveled in a car with a speedometer at some point in their life, that data is far more comprehensible than, say, inches of break. And when you see a number like "104," there's not much more that needs to be said beyond "Whoa."
Miller's first outing at a Padre, last Friday, saw him start by allowing two hits but quickly clean them up with a K and a double play. Returning to the mound in the eighth inning on Tuesday against the Diamondbacks, with his team leading 5-3, his stuff was just as eye-popping. But the results were a little rockier. Miller got a line-out to right on his first pitch, and he used his slider four out of five pitches to get a strikeout on Ketel Marte. But then he struggled to tame his own strength as he walked Geraldo Perdomo on exclusively fastballs that went by in a blink. That brought Lourdes Gurriel Jr. to the plate, with the chance to tie the game.]]></summary>

I am of course speaking of the Fly Over slide at the Duinrell amusement park in the Netherlands, the first and logically only waterslide that was entirely filled with water, forcing riders to hold their breath for the duration of the ride. Unlike boring, standard, "safe" waterslides, the water was not merely a lubricant to help riders go faster have "fun," but filled the tube to the brim and completely submerged anyone brave enough to ride it, and generated tangible anxiety in anyone who even heard about it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harrison Butker, an NFL placekicker best known for his wide-right worldview, hoped to parlay clutch kicks into political clout. His plan is not working out. 
A report released yesterday by the investigative team at Open Secrets shows Butker’s fledgling political action committee, known as Upright, is having trouble getting any lift. The PAC’s recent filing with the Federal Election Commission oozed lots of malaise and showed little money. Through the end of June 2025, Butker’s PAC had taken in only $4,023 in contributions this year and had just $1,786.43 left in its coffers. And, according to Open Secrets, of the $7,400 Upright has spent, “none of it benefitted Republican political candidates, either through direct donations to candidate committees or via advertisements that boost Republicans or criticize Democrats.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ESPN's position on the NFL is not unlike that of every other network with a significant sports presence, which is to say it scrubs where Roger Goodell says there's a stain. The football thing is the only provably and relentlessly bankable thing in the entire play-for-play diaspora, so ESPN is handing a 10 percent equity stake over to the league in exchange for the NFL Network, the RedZone channel, and other NFL media assets.
The long-awaited deal that subsumed ESPN's journalistic integrity, re: the NFL, is done. Alarm bells about diminished independence and the damage to journalistic integrity are ringing quite loudly, but in a diminishing number of circles. And besides, the days when anyone in ESPN's executive class are expected to care about any of that are long gone. ESPN is the cymbal-playing windup toy in the NFL's media orchestra, and that's just how ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro likes it. This, to appropriate a quote from prototypical owner-without-a-team Hyman Roth, is the business they've chosen, and being bed-partners is simply the logical extension of the way it works now.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An estate sale gives you a chance to look inside a person’s life. Did they own nice silverware? Were they a hoarder of worthless little tchotchkes? Did they have a creepy doll collection? A normal and not that creepy doll collection? At the higher end, this can offer a window into a public figure’s private life. Maybe you realize an athlete needs money. Maybe you learn some movie star was actually a big dork and heavily into comics. Or maybe you find out that Larry King had a corporate-desk ornament hologram of Larry King.
King, the longtime infomercial pitchman and cable news presence, died in 2021. His heirs are finally getting rid of all his crap. The Larry King Collection is now at Julien’s Auctions, and there’s a lot there. Before he flogged loans on TV, King hosted a live talk show on CNN for 25 years on a set that looked suspiciously like the one he’d later use to sell fish oil pills. Larry King Live landed big interviews on non-Omega 3 topics with celebrities, politicians, and other newsmakers. The Larry King Cardiac Foundation’s website now directs to the spam URL clockwork-game.com, but he also did some charity work. He had public speaking engagements. He went to thousands of Dodgers games. People gave him lots of stuff. There really is a ton of crap to get rid of.]]></summary>
