        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First, the apologetics. Barbecue sauce is not a necessity—not even and maybe especially not even to the making of good barbecue, but also just in general: You do not really ever need barbecue sauce, except perhaps where you expect the meat clad in it to come out otherwise dry or bland or underwhelming, and you can and should expect more of your barbecue efforts than to assume their products will need this help.
Now let's drive back in the other direction a little bit. Barbecue sauce is fine! It tastes good and it's fun, and making it is easy, and even excellent barbecue certainly isn't harmed by the option of drizzling or brushing it with something tart and sweet and hot and sticky. If barbecue sauce is not a need-to-have type of thing, then it is for sure a nice-to-have type of thing.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If last year was any indication, two races is far too early to bang the gavel on Championship domination—but for structure's sake, let's save McLaren for last anyway. The Chinese Grand Prix is one of six sprint race weekends on the calendar this year, and in typical fashion, the sprint spoiled the contours of the feature race, if not the final results—a newly repaved tarmac that grinds through medium compound tires, combined with a track that makes for difficult passing without significant tire advantage. Then, Lewis Hamilton demonstrated some much-needed dominance for Ferrari, converting a sprint-qualifying pole into a tire-management masterclass until the end; there was even a vintage tire complaint over the radio before he pulled away from the rest of the field.
In typical Ferrari fashion, the good signs did not last very long. Whatever setup tweaks were made between the sprint race and qualifying proved a disaster. The race itself provided a laundry list of misfortunes. Neither Hamilton nor Charles Leclerc impressed in qualifying, while Oscar Piastri took his first pole in Formula 1. On the first lap of the race, Hamilton and Leclerc made contact as both cars passed Max Verstappen's Red Bull, damaging Leclerc's front wing. (One lucky break: The damaged wing barely affected Leclerc's pace.) Later, Hamilton, unable to find the pace in the car, suggested a driver swap to his race engineer.]]></summary>

To start, "Debut Song" is not actually a debut song; it is a "pre-release single," or additional promotional material that happens to come in the form of a song, as part of a prolonged rollout before the group's official launch. KiiiKiii—that’s three i's, twice—started promotions on February 24 and will only officially debut a month later on March 24. Both "Debut Song" and its music video aren't meant to be taken very seriously. It's a referential satire on the industry; it's all in good fun.

The Luka Doncic trade, which only gets more shocking and stupid as time goes on, is the biggest piece of evidence in support of such a conclusion, but so is the fact that the entire organization has subsequently become snakebitten and overcome by an oafish spirit. Nothing good happens to this team anymore, and it can do nothing right.
Even the in-arena entertainment is suffering. Fans who attended Sunday's game against the 76ers—a 130-125 loss in which Quentin Grimes, the other guy the Mavs traded away at the deadline, led the Sixers with 28 points—were treated to a pregame hype video that can only be described as nightmarish.

He was quickly surrounded by three McNeese State defenders, but moved the ball around his body, spun toward the basket, and threw up a layup. It bounced around before falling through. With that, the fifth-seeded Clemson Tigers trailed 12th-seeded McNeese State by four. It was halfway through the first half, and the Tigers would be trailing by a lot more by the time they hit another shot.
When Chauncey Wiggins hit a three about five minutes later, it cut the Cowboys’ lead to 12. Things did not get much better from there. Clemson managed just one more field goal in the first half, and had only four at halftime. After shooting 37.2 percent on threes during the season, Clemson proceeded to go 1-for-13 from distance in the first half. McNeese led 31-13 at the break, not merely doubling up Clemson but Going Palindromic on them. Per Kenpom, Clemson had the 24th-best offensive efficiency in the country coming into the tournament.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first thing to know about Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s latest book, Dream Count, is that it is about women. Four women, to be precise. (Why is it always that women are grouped into fours?) This is Adichie’s first book in 12 years, after she conquered the New York Times bestseller list with her novel Americanah, which secured her place in the canon as a supreme chronicler of the immigrant experience. But even though Dream Count is set in the Covid era, it’s as if no time since Americanah has passed at all. Adichie is hopelessly nostalgic for a feminism of yore. It may be best read in a pantsuit.
The novel features the loosely connected stories of Chiamaka, a winsome travel writer; Zikora, a lawyer whose boyfriend abandoned her while pregnant; Kadiatou, a hotel maid and Chiamaka’s housekeeper; and Omelegor, a scheming yet wayward businesswoman in Nigeria. Adichie’s understanding of what it means to be a woman is that when you’re not being abused by your own body, you are being let down or terrorized by men. Chiamaka, who goes through a string of truly reprehensible boyfriends, has fibroids that cause her to bleed through her pants. Zikora undergoes an excruciating birth and struggles to breastfeed after her baby after the father of her child ghosts her. Kadiatou is forced into having a clitorectomy as a child. And then there is the episode where Omelegor’s boob is slapped during sex, which inspires her to move to America to study pornography (she’s against it).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consider the sugar beet, a sweet and tapered tuber. Unlike tropical sugarcane, sugar beets grow in temperate zones, enabling colder regions of the United States to farm their own sugar instead of relying on imports. From the late 19th century through the late 1970s, Utah abounded with sugar beet farms, and the crop's presence influenced the state's food culture. To Kate Wheeler, who until recently worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service, the sugar beet is a perfect portal into the Farm to School movement. Students can learn about Utah's history with the beet in social studies class. They can plant the beets in school gardens. And they can sample beets from nearby farms in the school cafeteria. Ideally, they're doing all three.
This is the spirit of Farm to School, which is not a government program but a tool that makes those programs more effective, Wheeler explained. Farm to School can involve local procurement of food, nutritional education, and school gardens. But Wheeler believes the tool becomes stronger when all three of these wings are combined in classrooms, cafeterias, and the community. Students are learning about food and nutrition, they are being nourished during the school day, and local farmers are building connections to schools. "This is a movement to change the way all of these other programs are interacting with the food system," she said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weeks after the Boston Celtics won the 2023–24 NBA championship, owner Wyc Grousbeck announced that the team was up for sale. Grousbeck was clearly selling as high as he possibly could, on the heels of a new owner-friendly CBA and a title and ahead of whatever massive economic turmoil the second Donald Trump administration is about to throw the country into. While the Celtics were going to fetch more than the then-record $4 billion Mat Ishbia paid for the Phoenix Suns in 2022, I was still surprised to see the eventual purchase price, announced Thursday morning: A group led by Bill Chisholm agreed to pay Grousbeck $6.1 billion, and will take over after the 2027–28 season.
That sum represents a seventeenfold increase on the price that Grousbeck and his co-owners paid in 2002, an exospheric leap that makes one wonder who exactly can afford to pay roughly the GDP of Sierra Leone for ownership of a sports team. Chisholm runs Symphony Technology Group, which is a private equity firm dedicated to hoovering up and degrading tech companies. In this sense, he's the perfect owner for a sports team based in Boston, a hub for private equity firms both competent and incompetent, and he epitomizes the new ownership class that will gradually take over from an extant crop of owners who may soon look to sell into such a frothy market.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detroit basketball fans have a new chant. In addition to the "DE-TROIT BASKETBALL" thing—more of a shout, really, but you take my meaning—they now chant "M-V-P" for young Cade Cunningham, who in his fourth NBA season has made The Leap. Cunningham is posting career highs in points, assists, defensive rebounds, blocks, usage, and scoring efficiency, and is the best player for a bonafide playoff team otherwise made up of well-meaning guys, plus Ausar Thompson (hell yeah) and Tobias Harris (gulp). Cunningham isn't really a serious MVP contender—basically no one is in a league that contains both Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Nikola Jokic—but he's earned this adoration. Anyway, he's got about as good a case as anyone else in his shit-ass conference. Let them chant, I say.
The Pistons beat the Miami Heat Wednesday night, in a contest that was maybe a little bit closer than it should've been. The Heat stink. Shipping off Jimmy Butler may have removed a distraction but it left the roster with just one player, in Bam Adebayo, who is capable of making regular contributions at both ends in a rotation gig. The Pistons maybe aren't exactly a powerhouse, but they're supposed to handle this lousy Heat outfit. "We just couldn't find that momentum to put us ahead," said head coach J.B Bickerstaff, after the game. "Every time it seemed like we were making a run, you'd look up and we were down by three." Cunningham mostly had an off night, shooting-wise, the Pistons struggled to produce clean three-pointers, and Erik Spoelstra's lean 7.5-man rotation made headway against Detroit's otherwise respectable bench units. It's just like that sometimes, especially for teams that have only recently arrived at conditions of general competence.]]></summary>

Simply trying to clear the zone on a penalty kill, Simon Benoit—he of do-a-cool-punch-then-get-punched fame—put the puck around the boards. Referee Kelly Sutherland, preparing to get out of the way, tripped over his own skates, fell down, and stopped the puck with his prone body in perfect position for Steven Lorentz to skate in and score the shorty. It would prove the winner in a 2-1 Toronto win over Colorado.

You can find glowing features on each of those septuagenarian coaching legends from the past few days at various media outlets. They don’t need me to carry water for them; the two have won a combined 1400 games, three national titles, and 15 Final Fours. There is no denying they are great basketball coaches. This week, though, they have a chance to make a different kind of history. They can do it by overcoming a curse that has haunted the tournament since it expanded to 64 teams back in 1985.
My favorite fun fact related to the tournament is that no team with a one- or two-seed that was unranked in the preseason AP poll has made a Final Four during the 64-team era. Those teams are not the rare occurrence you might expect, either. There have been 39 cases of this over the past 39 tournaments. For 39 teams seeded among the field’s top eight teams to collectively whiff on a Final Four appearance is pretty staggering, and enough to make this fact not just fun, but actually meaningful.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Tuesday night, ESPN MLB writer Jeff Passan shared that an innocuous article on the Department of Defense website honoring MLB legend Jackie Robinson's sporting and military career had been removed. Trying to access the old page redirected to a new, inoperative page with a URL that had "DEI" jammed into it. The Robinson article was part of a series called "Sports Heroes Who Served." Other such articles, like the one for fellow MLB Hall of Famer Bob Feller, remained live and un-DEI-ified. Now what could possibly explain the difference between Robinson and Feller?
The removal of the Robinson article followed an internal memo from Feb. 27, calling for a "digital content refresh" to "remove and archive DOD news articles, photos, and videos promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion." When asked about the removal of the page, DoD press secretary John Ullyot sent ESPN a statement, which is worth quoting in full for its self-satisfied derangement:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This morning I received what appeared to be blessed confirmation from NFL insider Tom Pelissero that the Minnesota Vikings were officially out of the Aaron Rodgers (snickering) sweepstakes. I had waited far, FAR too long for this news to drop. The Rodgers-Vikings connection only made sense to media members carrying water for a desperate, jobless Rodgers, and to casual observers who remembered Brett Favre joining the team in 2009. To everyone else, nearly all Vikings fans included, any suggestions that the team might be interested in Rodgers was as nonsensical as it was enraging. So I was grateful to Pelissero for putting the kibosh on all of that speculation and allowing me, at last, to bask in what has been a remarkable offseason for my team.
But Rodgers, like herpes, is a virus that refuses to die once inside your system. So here came Dianna Russini of The Athletic, vehemently attempting to keep the story alive by reporting that Minnesota was “simply not making a decision at this time.” That report, I could write off with ease, but then Vikings beat reporter Kevin Seifert of ESPN filed this report, buttressed by sources in Eagan, that officially kept the door 0.00000000000001 inches ajar.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Novak Djokovic's players union has mounted its most significant challenge to the governing superstructure of tennis. On Tuesday, the Professional Tennis Players Association, along with one dozen named professional tennis players, filed a sweeping lawsuit in U.S., U.K., and E.U. courts against the four most powerful agencies in global tennis: the International Tennis Federation, which oversees the administration of the Grand Slams and is the closest thing tennis has to an international governing body; the International Tennis Integrity Agency, which runs anti-doping; and the ATP and WTA tours. 
You can deduce a good deal about the strange, diffuse ways tennis is run through both the identity and quantity of both plaintiffs and defendants. This legal battle is, at heart, a conflict between labor and management over the latter's control of the former's production, though the PTPA is not technically a union of salaried employees and management is less a cohesive unit than an assemblage of interconnected bodies. The ATP, for its part, is partially constituted of the players themselves. Djokovic is not one of the named players in the suit, though the 585th-best WTA player and 1,099th-best ATP player in the world are.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe you forgot about the Los Angeles Clippers. It's cool. It happens to me all the time. I think I did not remember them even once between Christmas and, uh, Sunday. If you'd asked me Tuesday afternoon to place the Clippers in the Western Conference standings without looking, I would've said, "Anywhere between third and ninth," and you would've asked me to be more specific, and I would've said, "Hmm, probably somewhere between fourth and eighth, but also maybe tenth." The West is like this, yes, but my brain has been conditioned over decades to mark all active knowledge of the Clippers as a waste product and to scrub it from short-term memory. It's not even that I expect them to be bad. I expect them just not to matter very much.
With Tuesday's performance, the Clippers made a compelling case for closer attention. They fell behind early at home to the buzzsaw Cleveland Cavaliers, scrambled back, and then spent the second half beating the hell out of one of the NBA's very best teams. The extremely convincing win puts the Clippers a season-best nine games over .500, and keeps them within a game of the rising Golden State Warriors, who currently occupy the conference's sixth seed, clear of the play-in. Lots can happen between now and the end of the regular season. The top eight teams in the West are really good. The seven teams below Oklahoma City in the standings are separated by just five games; a proud homestand here, a swoon there, and anyone in there might conceivably snatch the second seed. Ask the Rockets, who held the second seed for 29 straight days then plummeted to fifth, and now find themselves back in second. Or the Grizzlies, who rose to second in February and were there as recently as last week, and woke up this morning in fifth, with the Warriors, Clippers, and seventh-place Minnesota Timberwolves all fogging up their sideview mirrors. It'll be a desperate sprint from here.]]></summary>

It’s a very deep gorge, and its contents are so potentially dangerous that all of the world’s superpowers have deemed it necessary to entrust 24-hour surveillance of the gorge to … two people. Who are stationed on opposite sides of the gorge. One of those guards is professional idiot Miles Teller. The other is living Vermeer painting Anya Taylor-Joy.

However, thanks to tactical binoculars and a truly fantastical ability to write legible signs, our gorge-crossed lovers meet-cute at a distance and, in keeping with the spirit of tired romantic comedy, even manage to dance to the Ramones together before they both fall into the gorge. Once stuck down there, they must spend the rest of the movie killing knockoff Last of Us zombies while trapped in a knockoff Upside Down from Stranger Things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On March 8, pro-Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil was arrested in his apartment building in New York by agents from the Department of Homeland Security. Khalil, a green card holder who is married to a U.S. citizen, has been held in a detention facility in Jena, La. since his arrest despite not being charged with a crime. The White House has been brazenly honest about the fact that Khalil is not accused of breaking any laws, instead arguing that the administration has a right to deport Khalil because he "led activities aligned to Hamas."
Tuesday night, Khalil's attorney released a letter from Khalil that had been dictated from inside the Louisiana detention facility. Here is that letter:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Saturday, U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg tried and failed to block an agreement between the Trump administration and El Salvador that would pay the Central American country $6 million to imprison hundreds of people who were living in America. To make the deal happen, the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, used most notoriously to justify the mass internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. The act, in theory, can only be deployed in the context of war, but the Trump administration is using it as a weapon for a peacetime immigration clampdown. By claiming that Venezuelan "gang members" are invading the U.S., the Trump administration is attempting to bypass standard legal protections to quickly deport any immigrant whom they decide to say is associated with a gang.
Boasberg's ruling came after the ACLU sued on behalf of five people facing imminent threat of deportation. Already, however, the administration was sending hundreds of people on a pair of flights to Central America. While Boasberg verbally ordered the planes to be turned around so those on them could have a chance to be heard in court, the Trump administration refused, and instead took the opportunity to gloat about defying the order.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always liked Quentin Grimes. He's athletic and smart, and when he broke out as the fifth starter for the cool-as-hell 2022–23 Knicks, he did so by defending the point of attack with ragged intensity and taking advantage of the opportunities created for him by Jalen Brunson and Julius Randle. Like a plant thriving in low-light conditions, he was a master of fitting into the Knicks' scheme without ever disrupting things.
The bummer of Grimes's career is that his modularity and scant caloric demands, the very traits that made him fit in so well with New York, also made him fit in everywhere else. He has played for four teams in his four professional seasons: The Clippers traded him for Keon Johnson on draft night, the Knicks traded him to for Bojan Bogdanovic at the deadline last year, the Pistons traded him for Tim Hardaway Jr. last offseason, and the Mavericks just traded him to Philadelphia for Caleb Martin a few weeks ago. Grimes is a restricted free agent after this season, so it's easy to imagine him wearing his fifth NBA uniform next fall. Every step of the way, Grimes has played the same role, starting about one third of the time and playing about 25 minutes per game, because every previous team he's been on had either a Luka Doncic knockoff or the man himself to run things.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2006, by the time the scientist Sarah Cooley finished graduate school in marine science, oyster larvae in the Pacific Northwest had already begun dying mysteriously and dramatically—unable to form shells. By 2008, the largest oyster hatchery on the West Coast suffered losses of 80 percent. Hatcheries spent thousands of dollars stamping out any possible pathogens. But scientists eventually realized the killer was not bacterial, but chemical. The seawater had become acidic, the result of the ocean absorbing some of the surplus of carbon dioxide in the air. In 2010, researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, determined this corrosive water was killing the baby oysters.
The pH of the ocean is generally stable. But when carbon dioxide dissolves in water, a series of chemical reactions occur to create carbonic acid, lowering the pH of seawater and altering the chemistry of the ocean. In the past two centuries, the ocean has become 30 percent more acidic, a shift that has happened faster than any known change in ocean chemistry in the last 50 million years. This process, called ocean acidification, has profound effects for the many lives, human and non-human, that depend upon the ocean—dissolving the homes of shelled animals like oysters and the skeletons of coral, as well as destabilizing food webs and ecosystems.]]></summary>

What have we gained from this wacky, woo-woo experiment in nurturing our inner artist? Maybe it was a journaling habit. Maybe it's a greater sensitivity to the coincidences that pop up in our everyday lives. Maybe it's a deep resentment toward Julia Cameron and a confirmation of our disdain for the self-help genre. As we round out the last two weeks of this project, a few of us are re-committing to the process in the hopes of ending strong, and others are counting down the days. If you've been following along with us, congratulations on making it this far. Which camp have you landed in?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having the regular season start before Opening Day is a prospect as indulgent as it is unreal—once you're up early to watch the Los Angeles Dodgers play the Chicago Cubs at 6 a.m. ET, you may as well buy in, even if the game had a nasty spring training hangover. No pitcher was fully stretched out. The Hanshin Tigers shut out the Dodgers and Cubs in back-to-back exhibition games just two days ago; Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman were out with ailment and injury for this morning's lower bracket match-up. There wasn't much, as far as glimpses into how each team would look throughout the rest of the regular season go.
This is not a complaint. The only thing better than one Opening Day is two, and the soft power exchange of MLB with Pokémon meant that no fewer than six Pikachus dressed in baseball jerseys were placidly bobbling about the diamond for the teams' on-field introductions. Novelty value aside, Joe Davis gave a brief history of Japanese baseball as cultural exchange; Japanese baseball legend Sadaharu Oh was present for the game. If it didn't quite feel like regular season baseball, well—that was hardly the most important part. Last year's Seoul Series, for all its splendor, was overshadowed by the news of Ippei Mizuhara's gambling scandal. This year, there was just baseball and Cool Japan, and the fans in the stadium got a little bit of everything.]]></summary>

Washington started its quest to return to the title game with a victory. And the Orlando Pride raised its championship banners, followed by a decisive 6-0 win over the Chicago Stars. After the match, Pride midfielder Haley McCutcheon talked about the club’s plans for defending its title: "We don’t like to talk about outside noise, but there’s been a lot of talk about 'Who's gonna win the shield? Who's gonna win the championship?' and we’ve not really been in the conversation, which is hilarious to us." 
The season openers also followed an offseason that saw the league bouncing from one report of abuse to another. The latest is this: the San Francisco Chronicle reported earlier this month that two formal complaints have been filed against Bay FC head coach Albertin Montoya, who's been with the club for about a year and a half. Players called his coaching methods "toxic" and said team management knew about their concerns. One complaint was cleared by a third-party investigation initiated by the team. The second complaint was made through the league’s anonymous tip line but, per the Chronicle, its status remains unknown. From that same report:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After defeating Clara Tauson in February to win the first Masters 1000 title of the season, 17-year-old phenom Mirra Andreeva became a top-10 player for the first time in her young career. She joked in her on-court interview that doing so meant she'd already accomplished her primary goal for the season. In the moment, that felt like a sensible benchmark, impressively achieved. Three weeks later, having completed a stunning run through the best players in the world to win in Indian Wells, Andreeva looks to have been selling herself short.
Andreeva's run to her second title of the year was phenomenal. She dropped six total games against Tauson and Elena Rybakina over the third and fourth rounds, and dispatched the red-hot Elina Svitolina to set up a foreboding summit push: a semifinal against Iga Swiatek and a potential final against Aryna Sabalenka. Neither had dropped a set until facing Andreeva. Ripping through the rest of the WTA elite is one thing, but the world's best two players stand head and shoulders above the field, especially with Coco Gauff still struggling with her serve. Swiatek and Sabalenka each present distinct problems for opponents to solve, and each is capable of bullying opponents off the court with relative ease. Last year's U.S. Open final made clear how wide the gap between one and four is.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It wouldn't be a Playboi Carti album rollout if you didn't have to sweat for it. Music, which comes five years after Whole Lotta Red, and which we thought we would get sometime last year, finally arrived Friday morning, though even that included a multiple-hour delay from its original 12 a.m. Pacific time slot. With its daunting 30-song track list, you can see that Carti tried to make up for the wait.
Music (or I Am Music, if you prefer) is a hard album to review because of how little it resembles an album in any classic sense, and I'm not just referring to the DJ Swamp Izzo tags throughout the project. It's more reminiscent of mixtapes by Gucci Mane, Waka Flocka Flame, or, more specifically, Lil Wayne's Drought and Dedication series. It's a collection of 30 songs that don't always jell together, and (sorry, old man here) aren't exactly sequenced well. But no one would ever argue that Gucci's Chicken Talk or Wilt Chamberlain tapes were cohesive, perfect projects, as mixtapes of that ilk tended to be a mixed bag. What made the classic ones classic was a combination of time and place, the good songs being especially good, and the creative freedom that comes from not being pressured to make some big artistic statement. Music maintains this spirit, flooding you with music and letting you make of it what you want. The highs are high enough to forgive the lows.]]></summary>

Well, mostly we know. Gallo is in some ways the prototypical no-average/high-power lug of his era, and for a while was a player who could convince teams to take the 40-homer seasons and defensive benefits (he’s a two-time Gold Glover) alongside the 200 strikeouts and sub-.200 averages that came with them. It might be that the more apt tense on that verb in fact is now "was." Gallo put up a .161/.277/.336 slash line in 76 games with the Nationals last year, and was released by the talent-destitute Chicago White Sox last Friday after going 2-for-21 with 11 strikeouts in spring training.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somewhere among the crudités, preserves, and edible flowers in With Love, Meghan, you may notice a tragedy: The Duchess of Sussex would have made an excellent working royal. Is this not their whole thing? Using the soft power of images to hide how little they have to say? Perfecting party tricks because they need no other skills? The eight-episode Netflix cooking show claims our lives can be “elevated” with just a tiny bit of plotting. (Serving a basket of croissants with strawberry preserves and a couple fresh strawberries, for example, can tell “a strawberry story.”) Meghan wraps gifts, works peonies into wild floral arrangements, speaks enough Argentinian Spanish to get by, and prints menus for brunch parties in her own chic calligraphy.
The whole thing is soothing and perfectly forgettable—except for these lines, which I plan to incorporate into my own story, to the confusion and alarm of my friends. (All are spoken by the Duchess herself, unless otherwise noted in parentheses.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chuck Schumer was always going to come out of the budget showdown a loser. The only question was which of the two available forms of losing he would end up with: an organized legislative surrender to Donald Trump and Elon Musk, which was the outcome he was trying to lead the Democrats toward, or a personal public rejection by his own party. 
In the end, the Senate minority leader got both. He scraped up eight more Senate Democrats to join him and John Fetterman in breaking his own party's filibuster, allowing the continuing resolution written by the House Republicans to advance and sparing Donald Trump from presiding over a government shutdown. He pulled the deal together—allowing Democrats to offer amendments that would fail to pass, to show they'd tried—over the enraged objections of the united House minority, from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ("To see Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk, I think is a huge slap in the face") to Nancy Pelosi ("This false choice that some are buying instead of fighting is unacceptable").]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Up until Saturday night, the athletic legacy of the University of California San Diego centered on its national championship-level surfing team. Yeah, surfing—it’s a sport, and you SEC-centric troglodytes will have to deal with it. You don't like it? Go take it up with your fussy Airbnb host/god, Nick Saban.
And surfing is very much the sort of sport that a school like UCSD would be good at. UCSD is mostly known as a Public Ivy—long on brain, mostly indifferent to brawn. It tried football for one year a long time ago, went 0-7, and determined that high-speed human collisions weren't for them, as smart folks might. The athletic department has done good work in other areas, but surfing is the calling card. If only there were raftloads of NIL money that came with it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What a week for Liverpool, and I mean that in the most derogatory way possible. In retrospect, going down 1-0 to bottom-dwelling Southampton last Saturday should have been a warning sign, even if the Reds came back to win 3-1. The two matches since that mildly annoying Premier League showdown have cost Liverpool chances at two trophies—and even more concerningly, they've raised real doubts about the club's ability to hang on to first place and earn the one that's most important.
It started with the Champions League, a competition that Liverpool had romped through in the league stage. Its only loss was a 3-2 defeat to PSV Eindhoven in a match that didn't seem to matter at the time. However, that loss made it so Liverpool would face the winner of Brest against Paris Saint-Germain, which was (unsurprisingly) PSG. The reward for its dominant first stage was to meet the second-hardest possible opponent in the round of 16.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are two kinds of sports: movement sports and anticipation sports. In movement sports, the pleasure of watching comes from lengthy stretches of action that absorb your attention with a smooth rhythm and beautiful motion. In anticipation sports, the excitement is build-and-release—you have a good sense of when, exactly, you need to focus closely on what's happening, and the rest of the time you spend gaming out scenarios for what might go down. Soccer, hockey, and cycling are among the movement sports. Baseball, football, and tennis are among the anticipation sports. I'm not saying one type is better than the other, just that each has its own particular style.
But what happens when you try to force a movement sport to go against its DNA and become an anticipation sport? You get something flawed and unnatural, annoying and unpleasant. You get the final minute of a basketball game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I saw Blanche DuBois, she was just words on a page. I was a teenager with somewhat sophisticated reading tastes, and so I'd bought a skinny paperback copy of the Tennessee Williams play A Streetcar Named Desire. I moved through it quickly and at least partially recognized its greatness, but I was almost entirely focused on the character of Stanley Kowalski. Someone just reading the script of a play has to create a "performance" almost entirely with their mind, but Stanley helps you out plenty. He's blunt, harsh, dominant. In contrast with Blanche, whose inefficient dialogue hovers around the edges of what she means, Stanley creates a forceful impression.
STANLEY:
What does it cost for a string of fur-pieces like that?
BLANCHE:
Why, those were a tribute from an admirer of mine!
STANLEY:
He must have had a lot of—admiration!
BLANCHE:
Oh, in my youth I excited some admiration. But look at me now!
[She smiles at him radiantly]
Would you think it possible that I was once considered to be—attractive?
STANLEY:
Your looks are okay.
BLANCHE:
I was fishing for a compliment, Stanley.
STANLEY:
I don't go in for that stuff.
BLANCHE:
What—stuff?
STANLEY:
Compliments to women about their looks. I never met a woman that didn't know if she was good-looking or not without being told, and some of them give themselves credit for more than they've got. I once went out with a doll who said to me, "I am the glamorous type, I am the glamorous type!" I said, "So what?"
BLANCHE:
And what did she say then?
STANLEY:
She didn't say nothing. That shut her up like a clam.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I wrote about the 2023 Australian Grand Prix, I figured it would be the most chaotic Melbourne race I'd ever recap. In fairness to the me of two years ago, it's hard to top three red flag stoppages—something that hadn't happened before and hasn't happened since. However, the 2025 edition of the Melbourne race, this time the season opener, might have had it beat. It's all thanks to one of the few elements of Formula 1 racing that the meticulous teams can't control: rain.
After a dry weekend of practice sessions and qualifying—where McLaren continued their dominance from last season by putting both Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri on the front row—the forecast for Sunday's race called for rain, and the rain obliged. The Formula 2 race scheduled for the hours before the main event was cancelled, and even though the precipitation had mostly quieted down by the time the F1 cars got to the grid, the track was still sopping wet. It didn't take long for things to get messy. On the formation lap before the start of the race, rookie VCARB driver Isack Hadjar lost control of his car and banged into the wall. It was a devastating debut for the 20-year-old (one so painful that it even got Anthony Hamilton, father of Lewis Hamilton, to walk over and console the rook) and a sign of things to come.]]></summary>
