        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although far from the European front lines, the then-British colony of Sierra Leone was important to the war effort in both world wars. In World War I, the Royal West African Frontier Force served in operations against German forces in then-Togoland. In World War II, the strategic location of the port of Freetown meant it was fortified and became a critical base for protecting sea routes to the Middle East, India, and Australasia.

The vast majority of these forces were native Africans, many of them Sierra Leonean. Sierra Leoneans served as soldiers in the Frontier Force, and an even larger number served in the Carrier Corps. Combat in the African interior relied on vast quantities of materiel, but a lack of roads and mechanization meant that often the only effective method of transport was on the heads of the Carrier Corps.

Sierra Leonean forces saw combat from East Africa to Italy, and faced a grim death toll. Besides death in combat, many hundreds died of sicknesses including dysentery, tuberculosis, and especially malaria. The Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery honors soldiers who died during service in World War II. The cemetery contains the graves of 70 West African and four British soldiers.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://crosswordracing.com/crosswords/2024-12-16-19-0-42d9-frontpage.html"/>
        <updated>2024-12-16T19:05:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN, I’ve been working on this multiplayer crossword for a while now. There’s still so much more on my todo list for it, but I think it’s time to launch and get some feedback with what I have.
Every hour, a new crossword (13×13 or 15×15) is generated at https://crosswordracing.com If you prefer smaller/faster, every ten minutes, a new mini crossword (7×7 or 11×11) is generated at https://crosswordracing.com/mini
You’re playing each crossword at the same time as everyone else, racing to complete it first. You can’t see what you’ve got right, until you correctly complete the entire grid. But you get some fun feedback on what other players are doing: a cell turns green if one other player has correctly solved it, orange if two other players have, and red if three or more other players have entered the correct letter in that cell.
Chat is emoji-only for the first half of the game (i.e. 30 minutes for the front-page, 5 minutes for the mini). After that, it unlocks and you can chat freely.
If you’re not done when the next crossword is generated, you can just stay on the current page for as long as you like and keep working to solve it.
I didn’t manage to get user accounts done before my arbitrarily-imposed launch date, so everyone is anonymous for now. I definitely want to build accounts, streaks, trophies, etc. The other big thing I’m excited to build is a “team mode”. You should be able to play on a team, where you can chat freely with your team-mates, and the cell colors indicate what the other team has (collaboratively) got correct. I think that would be a lot of fun.
Thanks for reading, checking it out, and for any feedback. Feel free to ask me anything, of course.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I honestly hate freelancing because it often feels unclear and stressful when starting new jobs, especially when employers aren’t sure what they want.
For the past few years, I’ve focused on specific projects like mobile chat apps using Flutter. With my existing codebase and experience, these jobs are easier and less stressful. I usually sell my codebase and move on.
However, finding these types of jobs is challenging. I tried many Upwork alert apps, but they either don’t work well or have over 95% false positives.
That’s why I created UpHunt. With UpHunt, you can create multiple profiles, and AI will match your profiles with Upwork jobs. You’ll receive instant notifications and can be the first to apply.
It's still a completely free project. I just need to hear your thoughts and feedback!

        <link href="https://decodeinvesting.com/chat?agents=lima"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We created autonomous AI Agents that monitor the stock market for you while you go about your day.
How it works:
Tell our AI Assistant what you want to monitor, and it creates a project for our team of autonomous AI Agents. You'll get notifications (email + app) when significant events matching your criteria are detected. For short-term projects, you'll be notified when your analysis is ready.
Behind the scenes:
When you give the AI Assistant a request to monitor an entity (like a stock or group of stocks), an AI Project Manager plans the project and breaks the project down into manageable tasks. These tasks run asynchronously - some recurring (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly), others one-time.
Example prompts you can try:
Long-term monitoring:
- "Monitor Apple stock and notify me of any important events and red flags"
- "Monitor Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta stock. Notify me if any of them start trending toward being undervalued"
Short-term analysis:
- "Create a project to analyze the last 30 earnings calls for Tesla, spot trends, and how the business has evolved over time"
You can track the progress of all tasks as the AI Agents work in the background.
Try it here: https://decodeinvesting.com/chat
This is still an early version - we're actively improving it based on feedback. Would love to hear what you think and what features you'd want to see next!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN,
We’re excited to share PySpur, an open-source tool that provides a graph-based interface for building, debugging, and evaluating LLM workflows.
Why we built this:
Before this, we built several LLM-powered applications that collectively served thousands of users. The biggest challenge we faced was ensuring reliability: making sure the workflows were robust enough to handle edge cases and deliver consistent results.
In practice, achieving this reliability meant repeatedly:
1. Breaking down complex goals into simpler steps: Composing prompts, tool calls, parsing steps, and branching logic.  
2. Debugging failures: Identifying which part of the workflow broke and why.  
3. Measuring performance: Assessing changes against real metrics to confirm actual improvement.
We tried some existing observability tools or agent frameworks and they fell short on at least one of these three dimensions. We wanted something that allowed us to iterate quickly and stay focused on improvement rather than wrestling with multiple disconnected tools or code scripts.
We eventually arrived at three principles upon which we built PySpur :
1. Graph-based interface: We can lay out an LLM workflow as a node graph. A node can be an LLM call, a function call, a parsing step, or any logic component. The visual structure provides an instant overview, making complex workflows more intuitive.  
2. Integrated debugging: When something fails, we can pinpoint the problematic node, tweak it, and re-run it on some test cases right in the UI.   
3. Evaluate at the node level: We can assess how node changes affect performance downstream.
We hope it's useful for other LLM developers out there, enjoy!

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42433683</id>

        <updated>2024-12-16T18:19:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been on the job hunt for the past few months and after going through numerous reddit threads and Linkedin posts I saw that customized resumes make a huge difference in getting callbacks. But every tool I tried was either bloated with 50+ features I didn’t need or way too expensive (some were charging $70/month!). These people think I'm made of money!
So I decided to build my own AI resume builder.
It’s simple and streamlined:
It takes your resume and the job post and generates  a custom resume tailored to that post. (We do not store your resume or use it to train the AI)
What used to take me 20-30 minutes now takes 30 seconds.
I’ve gotten callbacks from companies like Apple, Nvidia, Meta, and Amazon using it.
The pricing is designed to be accessible: the more jobs you apply to, the cheaper it gets — around $2 per resume.
I'd love for you to try it out and let me know what you think!

Smash burgers are a menu slam dunk. Is that a good thing?
 I can’t remember the last time I saw a burger that didn’t have a lacy edge. I know they still exist out there, half-pound bistro burgers oozing with juice, but these are not the burgers that trend, the burgers that beckon obsession on TikTok. No, the burgers I am told I want are meaty doilies, pressed nearly paper thin, ground beef fried to a crisp.
Over the past five years or so, smash burgers have grown in national popularity. But 2024 was the year they officially peaked — and maybe jumped the shark. A genuine creativity around incorporating new flavors into smash burgers has made the inevitable turn into a mandatory menu addition for every place that is trying to be the next big thing.

Orders from last week started going out over the weekend, and hundreds more are shipping today.
It’s too late now to get an order in for Christmas, no matter where you live, but it’s not too late to place an order from this batch of shirts and hoodies. But, we’ll probably close the store to new orders tomorrow (Tuesday), so don’t wait. My sincere thanks to everyone who’s bought one (or in many cases, more than one).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Malmö harbor, a cone-shaped concrete relic of World War II-era architecture rises above the former dockyard like a giant vertical cigar: the Spetsbunker, a towering 60-foot (18-meter) bomb shelter. 

The bunker’s construction around 1940 solved a significant challenge for the nearby then-bustling shipyard: the waterlogged, unstable ground made underground shelters impractical. Designed to protect up to 150 workers, the structure, however, ultimately went unused, as Sweden remained largely untouched by the war.

While relatively common in wartime Germany, this type of above-ground bunker is believed to be the only one of its kind in Sweden. Drawing on the pioneering work of engineer Leo Winkel, known for creating Winkeltürme (“Winkel Towers”) or Spitzbunker (“Pointed Bunkers”), the structure embodies both functionality and creativity. 

The air raid shelter’s tall, narrow, circular base, with a metal-reinforced pointed top, was crafted to be nearly invisible to enemy bombers and exceptionally difficult to destroy. Even a direct hit would cause the payload to glance off the surface, rather than penetrating the walls.

Overgrown with vines, the Spetsbunker remains a stoic sentinel. Though closed to the public, its weathered interior features a spiral staircase, platforms, and a central shaft with a winch. Its distinctive silhouette continues to serve as both a historical landmark and a reminder of wartime innovation.]]></summary>

 With all the chaos of the holiday season swirling, it’s not a surprise that you’re online right now trying to find a gift for someone in your life. There’s a lot going on this time of year, and a trip to the mall definitely won’t make you feel any less stressed out about getting everything checked off your to-do list.
But there is a foolproof solution that doesn’t involve making a frantic, last-minute shopping trip: just give the recipient you have in mind a really great food subscription box. It’s both an easy gift and a win-win: Your recipient gets to open a present multiple times over the course of the next year, and you’ll also save yourself several headaches by jumping online and ordering something to be shipped directly to their door instead of fight…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So it's agreed, then: The only Super Bowl that America should demand after the year we've all had is Bills-Lions. It has all the elements we think we deserve—points, absurd plays, points, easily caricatured main characters, points, long-to-the-point-of-seemingly-interminable-suffering fan bases, points, a coach who wants all his linemen to have touchdowns, more points, another coach who has been slagged repeatedly for not reaching let alone winning the big one, additional points, the MVP and the Coach Of The Year if you're into that sort of thing, further points, towns that fight the odds just by getting out of bed every day, another round of points, drunks jumping through furniture, and one final round of points.
Now comes the hard part, which is coming to grips with the likelihood that we likely won't get Bills-Lions again, and having the fortitude and dignity to refuse to watch whatever matchup the National Football League tries to pretend we'd rather have instead. In other words, if it ain't Bills-Lions, we must cancel the parties, refuse to get dressed on game day, and hate-watch the Puppy Bowl instead. If we can't get it together to do the right thing in November, we may as well give it an honest go in February.]]></summary>

The French company Penarroya initiated the mining operations in 1927. From 1928 to the 1960s, these mines yielded tens of thousands of tons of lead annually, employing hundreds of workers who extracted resources from dynamite-blasted tunnels—an industrial technique now banned in Morocco.

At about 1.5 kilometers from the entrance, the main tunnel splits into two and narrow shafts dart off in several directions, with ladders and pulleys connecting to shafts at shallower and deeper levels. There are also some larger chambers used for storing disused trolleys, mining tools, and basic amenities for the miners, including a makeshift shower.

Ever since ChatGPT came out, I've been using it to debate and learn new ideas. Having a short insightful conversation where AI coaches you can be powerful but it's hard to get right with a general purpose chat LLM because they don't propose stories, lack context and don't track progression
I'm building Socratify with the hypothesis that a product built around AI questioning humans and proposing interesting questions daily can be 100x more rewarding than book summaries and other passive content.
Inspired by Charlie Munger's concept of a latticework of models that you apply to new situation. Socratify teaches you a concept (e.g., Disruption), discusses a situation where it's applicable, (e.g., Google vs. Perplexity) and gives you feedback as well as the strongest counterargument
Checkout the first release at https://www.socratify.com/
Appreciate thoughts from the HN community and would love to learn what you would want from an AI coach that makes you better every day

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a super simple accountability counter. I built it for myself because I wanted a no-BS, non-trackable, no-external data-saving tool for tracking my personal "daily" habits.
Statistically, someone out there might find it useful since I could use something like this. Planning to add google adsense to at least pay for hosting, but keeping it super simple.
Any feedback or comments would be greatly appreciated :) This is my first SHOW on HN!

If you are looking to impress a tea friend or matcha enthusiast, this is the matcha I would suggest. It toes the line between being fancy and flavorful without having an appalling price tag. Its deep green hue is an indicator of the high-quality matcha each tin provides, but if that doesn’t convince you, the aroma — and flavor — will. This matcha is rich, floral, and subtly sweet but rounded out by mild bitterness. It’s delicious drunk straight because the matcha is already so smooth, but I also find it adds the perfect earthy bite to matcha lattes. I love to pair it with warm milk and a drizzle of vanilla bean paste for a fragrant matcha latte that is arguably better than any of the pale, $8 versions you might order at a coffee shop. One warning: Once you try this matcha, you can never go back to the cheaper stuff (nor will you want to, anyway).



No peeking! But check out what the Eater Advent Calendar has already revealed.  And check back each day for a new clutch condiment, gadget, or nibble that, yes, makes an amazing gift — but these surprises are just for you.]]></summary>

first organizational document, the Prescript of 1868, declares that the group was formed “to protect

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN,
I Introduce a library of type-safe URL builder that can be used in the Blazor project.
Blazor is a cool technology that makes it easy for anyone to write modern web in C#, but I found it lacking in features around URLs.
Similar projects already exist, but this library is
* Compatible with razor's source generator (the previous one had to explicitly turn this off with the advent of .NET6)
* Automatic generation of @page, [Parameter], and [CounterWithQuery] attributes (handwriting is very tedious, right?)
* Automatic generation of highly customizable menu structures (icons, descriptions, L10N, all possible!)
Happy hacking!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Conclave, currently playing both in theaters and on demand, is the kind of movie that will generate almost all of its long-term business from its ending. Yes, it will be nominated for, and perhaps win, a whole shitload of Oscars. And yes, DOP Stephane Fontaine’s camerawork deserves one of those Oscars. If you want two hours of sumptuous Vatican porn (and the mood strikes me more often than you’d imagine), Fontaine and director Edward Berger deliver a movie with multiple frames that are literally suitable for framing. Put those shots in a fucking museum.
But that ain’t what anyone’s gonna talk about coming out of the theater. What everyone is gonna talk about is, “Oh wow, can you believe that ending?” And if you haven’t seen it Conclave yet, you’ll be besieged by satisfied customers encouraging you to experience its endgame for yourself. We’re still in the Spoiler Zone for this film, so I can’t and won't talk more about how Conclave’s plot resolves itself. Nor do I want to, because my opinion—and it’s only mine—is that it was corny and stupid.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a kind of hush that is specific to old-growth suburbs, a quietness that is more vast and more inherent than any disturbance that kind of place can kick up. The place where I grew up is different in some ways than it was when I was growing up there, but that fundamental quiet is undisturbed. Things happen and make their various sounds—you'll hear a quick blurt of music when someone steps out of a bar to smoke or as people come and go from one of the restaurants downtown, cars go by and dogs get bossy on their walks and freight trains chug and honk over the New Jersey Transit lines when the commuter trains aren't running. People still live there, and people make noise. The part that is striking, and which is striking to me whenever I go back to see my parents in the house where I grew up, is how the totality of that suburban quiet swallows all this up. It's there and then it is gone, and there is maybe the wind in the trees or just nothing at all.
I have lived in noisy places for longer than I ever lived in all that quiet, but the appeal of it isn't lost on me. I like how dark it gets at night there, and I like walking back from the train station down those quiet sidewalks and through all the old extraneous shortcuts of my youth. The last few times I've done this I have startled some deer standing around in a parking lot, as aimless and wary as I was when I did the same thing as a teenager; they stared at me but did not run. I am aware that it is a nice place to live and it was on balance a perfectly fine place to grow up. I understand why people live there. I am also under no illusions about how quickly and how thoroughly I would go insane if I were to try to do it again.]]></summary>

Joy in Marriages with ADHD

Date night!
We all love the concept.  But I hear many complaints from non-ADHD partners that they are tired of being in charge of date night.  Their ADHD partner 'never seems to get around to planning any.'  I get the disappointment, though I also push back sometimes and suggest that those with the executive functioning skillset might be well-suited to doing that planning if they don't take the lack of involvement from the ADHD personally.
However, here is another approach that might get a bit more attention from ADHD partners - Alphabet Date Night.  I ran into this concept online and loved it immediately because it's so FUN!  It also hits on two ADHD motivational strengths - gamification and 'new'.  
The idea is that you cycle through the alphabet selecting dates that start with different letters of the alphabet to keep things fresh.  Only use any given letter once in a 26-date cycle.  Some examples:
A


apple picking
alpacas (at the zoo)
aquarium
art exhibit
B
basketball game
basket exhibit
boating/boats
biking
beach
C
car show
cycling
cat bar (where you have lunch with cats - yes, it's a thing)
cooking (together; take a class; go to a cooking shop and pick out one thing for your kitchen)
comedy (movie; club; take an improv class together)
You get the idea.  You can look up lists of alphabet dates online...or you can have the fun of making your own.  Post it online in a joint document or on a bulletin board somewhere in your house and add to it as you think of new ideas.
So much fun!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In accordance with New York Athletic Club bylaws, any defensive player who wins the Heisman must be a dual threat player: one who also takes enough snaps on offense to remind voters of the QBs and RBs those voters like to vote for, and who normally win this award. That’s how legendary Michigan CB Charles Woodson secured the Heisman in 1997 (over betting favorite Peyton Manning), and it’s how Colorado CB/WR Travis Hunter edged out Boise State RB Ashton Jeanty for the honor on Saturday night. Hunter is even more of an offensive threat than Woodson was, amassing 92 receptions and 1,152 yards on offense this season while also serving as the Buffaloes’ shutdown corner. This man is a special talent, and the NFL Draft will reward him for it.
Now let’s talk about Hunter’s coach, who’s a total asshole.]]></summary>

This is mostly because I’ve already watched Detroit Lions RT Penei Sewell be tasked this season with executing both a hook-and-lateral and an option pass (he couldn’t find an open man and had to take the sack). Those are two jobs that professional fat guys are never entrusted with, although Sewell is a talented guy who has already proven himself a capable receiver. More to the point, who doesn’t get off seeing a 300-pound man doing shit normally reserved for men 100 pounds lighter?
Navy head coach Brian Newberry knows what I’m talking about. That’s why, up 21-13 against a ranked Army team that had just cut the lead down to a single possession, Newberry had the Midshipmen run this fake punt on fourth-and-5 from his own side of the field:]]></summary>

This week, it’s Sophiestication Software promoting the return of CoverSutra — a previous hit from the “delicious” era of Mac apps that is now back and better than ever.
After over a decade, the rejuvenated (reanimated?) CoverSutra has been reimagined as a sleek, standalone music player for your Mac that lives in your menu bar, giving you seamless access to your music library. Instantly search by album, artist, or song — all without breaking your workflow. Some of what’s new:
Standalone music player: No Music app required.
Instant music search: Find tracks anytime, anywhere.
Global keyboard shortcuts: Control playback from any app.
Available now on the Mac App Store for just $4.99 — and a free upgrade for CoverSutra 3.0 customers. Five bucks, one time, and it’s yours to keep. And it’s just so polished, so simple, and so nice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After being sold out for months, the upcoming sponsorship schedule at DF is wide open at the moment — including the final two weeks of the year. I know sponsors are sometimes hesitant to book weeks around major holidays, but, well, Daring Fireball is never “closed”. And traffic to the site is remarkably consistent even during weeks like Thanksgiving and Christmas. Nerds get bored and want to read interesting stuff.
Q1 2025 weeks are wide open too, but I only just now opened those weeks on the calendar.
Weekly sponsorships have been the top source of revenue for Daring Fireball ever since I started selling them back in 2007. They’ve succeeded, I think, because they make everyone happy. They generate good money. There’s only one sponsor per week and the sponsors are always relevant to at least some sizable portion of the DF audience, so you, the reader, are never annoyed and hopefully often intrigued by them. And, from the sponsors’ perspective, they work. My favorite thing about them is how many sponsors return for subsequent weeks after seeing the results.
If you’ve got a product or service you think would be of interest to DF’s audience of people obsessed with high quality and good design, get in touch. And again, this coming week remains open, and the week after. I’m even offering those two weeks at a holiday discount.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jack in the Box's Sourdough Smashed Jack features a quarter-pound smashed beef patty, American cheese, pickles, grilled onions, and Boss Sauce (a burger sauce that's also found on the Smashed Jack) served on grilled sourdough rounds.

I paid $8.59 for one and it's basically the Smashed Jack but one grilled sourdough rather than a brioche bun. For whatever reason, they fully wrapped the burger and then placed it in a clamshell box.


The beef patty offered a robust meaty flavor. It was thick but just a tad short in width to achieve full bread coverage. The grind was a little too fine for a burger. There was a nice browned crust on the patty but none of the crunch you might get from a smashed patty. The temperature was warm rather than hot.



The sourdough rounds were not sour at all and only lightly crispy. They were mostly soft and chewy.
The American cheese was thoroughly melted and gooey.



The pickles and onions combined to provide a watery crunch. The onions were lightly sweet while the pickles added a dose of acidity. Tying it together with a combination of savory and sweet notes was the Boss Sauce.



Overall, Jack in the Box's Sourdough Smashed Jack presented a solid burger that felt pricey for what you get.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joe Rossignol, MacRumors:
Apple plans to stop selling the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and
third-generation iPhone SE in European Union countries later this
month, to comply with a regulation that will soon require
newly-sold smartphones with wired charging to be equipped with a
USB-C port in those countries, according to French blog
iGeneration. All three of these iPhone models are still
equipped with a Lightning port for wired charging.
In a paywalled report today, the website said the iPhone models
will no longer be sold through Apple’s online store and retail
stores in the European Union as of December 28, which is when the
regulation goes into force.
It was never clear to me whether this regulation only applied to new devices, or to existing ones. But I guess it applies to existing ones. Until the expected next-gen iPhone SE ships early next year, the lowest-priced new iPhone in the EU will be the iPhone 15, which starts at $700 in the U.S. and around €860 in Europe. (Apple’s prices vary slightly between EU countries.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nifty new convert-to-Markdown library from a small indie development shop named Microsoft:
The MarkItDown library is a utility tool for converting various
files to Markdown (e.g., for indexing, text analysis, etc.)
It presently supports:
PDF (.pdf)
PowerPoint (.pptx)
Word (.docx)
Excel (.xlsx)
Images (EXIF metadata, and OCR)
Audio (EXIF metadata, and speech transcription)
HTML (special handling of Wikipedia, etc.)
Various other text-based formats (csv, json, xml, etc.)
The API is simple:
from markitdown import MarkItDown

markitdown = MarkItDown()
result = markitdown.convert("test.xlsx")
print(result.text_content)

Via Stephan Ango (CEO of the excellent, popular Markdown writing and note-taking app Obsidian), who also points out that Google Docs added Markdown export a few months ago. I’ve never used Google Docs other than to read documents created by others, but MarkItDown seems like a library I might make great use of. “MarkItDown” is even a great name. What a world.
Not bad for a 20-year-old syntax.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ryan Christoffel, also at 9to5Mac:
There are two key features that are part of iOS 18.2,
but aren’t yet ready for the Mac:
Genmoji
Mail app redesign
Genmoji are an especially unfortunate omission, as they’re
available on both iPhone and iPad with iOS and iPadOS 18.2.
Meanwhile the Mail app redesign is currently iPhone-exclusive, so
it’s missing from both the Mac and iPad in these next software
updates.
The omission of Genmoji creation in MacOS 15.2, and the omission of the new AI inbox categorization features in Mail on both iPad and Mac, aren’t surprises — they weren’t in any of the betas for these .2 OS updates. But it is a weirdly glaring omission. Apple itself started promoting screenshots of the Apple Intelligence inbox categorization in Mail for Mac back in October, when the .1 OS updates shipped with the initial round of Apple Intelligence features.
I am reliably informed that the new Mail categorization features are coming soon to iPad and Mac, which I suspect means in the .3 updates. But the first .3 betas aren’t out yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since skateboarding first emerged in the 1940s and 50s, the sport has evolved a lot. The boards are more advanced and the tricks are bigger, faster, and more complex. One thing that hasn't changed much over time though, is the urge to put art on the bottom of the boards. You can see this in the collection at the Geneva Skateboard Museum, which showcases boards from different eras of skateboarding.

The museum is made and run by Jim Zbinden, who has had the dream of this museum in mind for nearly 30 years. The first iteration of the museum came in the early 2000s. Hundreds of skateboards were displayed to show the intricate and unique art that has been a part of skateboarding culture for the last seven decades. 

In the museum's current location, you'll find three floors where each inch of wall and ceiling space is covered with skateboards and skateboard paraphernalia. The collection has everything from old used boards to new display boards to boards that belonged to famous skaters like Tony Hawk. This makes the museum interesting even for those who have never touched a skateboard in their lives.]]></summary>

At the State Correctional Institution at Huntingdon, Luigi Mangione reportedly has dinner options of chicken Parmesan or pizza beans, which sounds a lot like the beloved Smitten Kitchen recipe
 CNN’s Jean Carroll seemed sort of confused. While reporting on Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old accused of killing UnitedHealth CEO Brian Thompson, she noted that in his confinement at the State Correctional Institution at Huntingdon in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, he had the choice for dinner between “chicken Parmesan and something called pizza beans.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Watch enough Hannah Hidalgo games on TV, and you’ll grow used to hearing that she plays with “joy.” Glee, I could see. Abandon, sure. But joy feels too clean and delicate a word to describe the way Hidalgo conducts herself on a basketball court: the mean mug, the wagged tongue, after a parabolic pull-up three. The screams. The screams! There is so much screaming: when she finds a teammate on the run, when she launches into someone’s shoulder at the rim, topples to the ground, and draws a foul. They convince me less of her “love for the game” than of her pure, uncut hatred for opponents.
Forget shoulder shrugs or sly smiles; Hidalgo exists on a higher plane of expression. Never has a player been so delighted to demoralize. (Perhaps I’m projecting this malevolence on account of her Instagram stories, which range from bland disavowals of same-sex marriage to the somewhat more intriguing claim that Britney Spears, Katy Perry, Beyoncé and Ariana Grande “ARE ALL WITCHES” whose music is “satanic inspired” and “designed to pull you away from the creator.” Give her credit for consistency: She’s a nut on and off the court.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most surprising signings of the summer transfer window was also one of the quietest. Coming off of three unremarkable but respectable seasons in Spain, and at a crossroad of sorts in a career nearing but not yet in its final leg, Memphis Depay went left. Rather than join any of the usual suspects in one of Europe's major leagues, the Dutch forward opted instead to go to Brazil to play for Corinthians.
It is true that it wasn't exactly clear what the next logical step for Memphis's career would be. If redemption in the eyes of the greater soccer world was what he'd been after at Barcelona and Atlético Madrid, a chance to return to the elite and avenge himself for the lasting damage his Manchester United flameout did to his reputation, he didn't get it. So where to next? His fame, pedigree, age, status with the national team, and ambitions made for a peculiar mix, narrowing his potential options.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ghost Lore Museum in Jiufen, Taiwan, explores Taiwan’s rich traditions of ghost stories, superstitions, and afterlife beliefs. Located in Jiufen—a mountain town famous for its mist-shrouded scenery, narrow alleyways, and vibrant tea houses—the museum immerses visitors in the spiritual and supernatural aspects of Taiwanese culture.

While the museum only includes a couple of rooms, it is full of items and statues that showcase the diverse types of spirits and ghosts prominent in Taiwanese and East Asian folklore. It features iconic spirits like the gui (ghosts of those who suffered an unjust or tragic death) and jiangshi (the “hopping” vampires of Chinese myth). Explanatory panels accompany life-sized models, artifacts, and illustrations, offering a glimpse into the roles these spirits play in Taiwanese belief systems and rituals. Hidden inside a cabinet, a grotesque Krasue—a Southeast Asian demon with the internal organs exposed and connected to a flying female head—welcomes the visitor by repeating what they said while opening the door.

One of the highlights is the depiction of the Hungry Ghost Festival, an important event in Taiwan and other East Asian countries, when it’s believed that the gates of the underworld open, allowing spirits to visit the living. This exhibit showcases offerings, lanterns, and other ceremonial objects used to appease wandering souls, along with life-sized models that recreate festival scenes.

The museum displays a collection of traditional talismans, amulets, and symbols that people use to ward off evil spirits or attract good luck, especially related to Taoism. Visitors can learn about the symbolism behind each item and how they’re used in rituals to protect against misfortune or mischief from vengeful spirits, including a sword made of coins used by Taoist exorcists.

The place is built as an open photo booth, where visitors can take pictures while using the items around, lying inside coffins, or joining a set of heads inside jars.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gladiator II, Ridley Scott's sequel to Ridley Scott's Gladiator, is neither a good movie nor a bad movie—instead, it is easily one of the most movies in recent memory. Overstuffed and overacted (these are not complaints, mind you), Gladiator II has so much going on that the presence of (spoilers beyond this point) frickin' sharks in the frickin' Colosseum doesn't even make its Wikipedia summary. But look beyond the excesses of the film—easier said than done, given that a gladiator riding a rhinoceros like a surfboard appears not even halfway through—and there's another story here, one about how the politics of these films changed dramatically between the 2000 original and its 2024 sequel, and what that change says about the stories that America can still believe about itself.
In Gladiator, Rome is a civilizing force (the opening battle is a victory over barbarian tribes), and is on the verge of peacefully transitioning back to a republic. This version of Rome is a fundamentally virtuous nation that is threatened when Commodus, a vain and selfish degenerate, takes the reins of power instead of Maximus, the Cincinnatus-like humble general chosen by the dying emperor to return republicanism to the empire, who is subsequently exiled. It is essentially a late–Clinton-era narrative about America: A proud state has been brought low by the peccadillos of a flagrantly libertine leader who habitually disrespects the military, and the only way to return the nation to glory is for a morally upstanding political outsider (not one of those hated "career politicians") to defeat and remove this dishonorable interloper. And when Maximus completes his task and lays dying—term limited by Commodus's dagger—he demands that power be returned to the Senate. Even in death, Maximus was an institutionalist.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While virtually every city has a tree that can claim to be the oldest, not many have a story as interesting as the one in Paris. Located in Square René Viviani within sight of the Notre Dame, an ancient black locust tree grows behind a wire fence. Surrounded by vibrant moss and saplings, its age is given away by the (somewhat poorly) camouflaged concrete struts that help support its heavier branches.

Something surprising about the oldest tree in the French capital is that it's not actually French. It was brought from Appalachia by the Parisian botanist Jean Robin, who found that many North American plants were suited to the temperate French climate. The entire genus of locust trees was later named for Robin, giving the Parisian tree the scientific name Robinia pseudoacacia. (The “pseudo” comes from the fact that while similar to acacias, the robinia is not closely related.)

The introduction of these trees to Europe has been somewhat of a mixed bag. It grows fast and strong, so it has been used to repopulate deforested areas and to provide lumber. The flowers are used in a surprising amount of foodstuffs, from teas, pancakes, and fritters to the renowned acacia honey. As they are quite shady, pollution-resistant, and long-lived, they became a popular fixture along city streets. It is this hardiness, however, that also makes it a pest.

In many parts of Europe, uncontrolled black locust growth has made it classified as an invasive species. Australia and South Africa have deemed it a weed. Even in North America, it can be considered invasive as it spreads away from the Appalachian region and converts native grasslands into forests. While there have been efforts to eliminate the spread of black locust to areas where it isn’t wanted, Paris does its best to keep its patient zero alive. The crutches that hold up its branches give the impression that the old tree might be a couple of centuries past its prime. Time will tell how long it holds its impressive title.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perched on a hillside with sweeping views over the River Derwent, Alexandra Battery offers a glimpse into Hobart’s colonial past. Built between 1880 and 1882, during a time of international anxiety, the battery was part of a network designed to protect the city’s bustling port from the threat of invasion, especially from the Russians, who had a habit of turning up unannounced, much to the locals’ alarm. Back then, two unanticipated Russian warships anchored in the Derwent, sending shockwaves through Hobart and giving the military planners an urgent push to shore up the city’s defenses.

Alexandra Battery was one of several fortifications established around the river, forming a protective triangle designed to ward off any would-be invaders. Crafted from repurposed stone salvaged from dismantled older batteries, it combined practicality with a prime position, offering uninterrupted sightlines across the river. Though the cannons never saw combat, the battery’s presence provided a sense of security in a world of shifting alliances and growing naval power.

Now a public park, Alexandra Battery is a place where visitors can explore its atmospheric tunnels and storerooms, imagining a time when artillery and ammunition filled the space.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why is Bill Belichick the new head football coach for the University of North Carolina? Reporting done by The Athletic's Jeff Howe, combined with the fact that no professional team offered Belichick a job last offseason, would indicate that Belichick was forced into a college job because the NFL no longer wants him. But sources close to the man himself would like to tell a different story, and have done so through ESPN's Seth Wickersham. No, the NFL didn't turn its back on Belichick; he turned his back on it. "This is a big fuck you to the NFL," is how one of Belichick's confidants described the decision to Wickersham.
OK, sure. It doesn't really matter if any of us believe that a guy who is just 15 victories away from breaking Don Shula's all-time wins record willingly walked away from the NFL in order to coach football at a basketball school. What matters is that Belichick, and the people around him, seem to truly believe that.]]></summary>

 Finding the time to leave the house and actually go holiday shopping might seem next to impossible. But there’s a way to make things more efficient: While you’re making the Herculean effort to pick up a take-out noodle soup or a cart full of groceries at your local Chinese, Japanese, or Korean supermarket, know that options for holiday shopping are all over the aisles. Broadly speaking, the housewares, beauty, and stationery sections at these stores are full of great gift ideas, particularly in the “stocking stuffer” category — and particularly if your recipient is really into food.
This online shopping guide obviously negates the whole point of picking up extra items while you’re buying groceries, but should serve as inspiration the next time you’re pushing a cart down the aisles. If you’re adding these to cart, though, throughout this guide we’ve suggested purchasing from AAPI-owned businesses alongside the bigger box retailers where possible, to keep the original spirit of the practice alive. — EDJ

With restaurants trying to cater to the widest possible audience, why do so many still miss the mark with vegan and vegetarian food?
 No one walks into a barbecue restaurant or a smash burger joint expecting plentiful plant-based options. But on a beautiful fall Sunday, with a group of friends of various dietary needs, I did not expect to walk into a pub in tony Brooklyn and see nary a vegan item on the menu. Not even the fries, which came with aioli instead of ketchup, and which served as the only vegetarian item on the menu. This was a pub, a style of restaurant which purports to be for every kind of person. The omission was glaring.
Vegan dining has made incredible strides since I had, I’m sorry to say, the worst cake of my life at a high school birthday party. Sad …]]></summary>

I also want to tell you about the goldfish puppet who monologued about his existence for about three times as long as I was expecting. But first I should probably explain at least the basics.
Give Me Carmelita Tropicana!, the final production for Soho Rep in its extremely intimate space on Walker Street, is a delirious supernatural caper written by Alina Troyano and Branden Jacobs-Jenkins. Troyano plays herself and Ugo Chukwu plays Jacobs-Jenkins as they chase the incorporeal title character—a real-life performance persona of Troyano's—through both New York City and a fantasy universe inhabited by Troyano's past characters. Both of the psychedelic experiences I mentioned appear before you in its intermission-free two hours (a good thing; you won't want to escape), along with so much more that can't be done justice as written words, and maybe shouldn't. The momentum and elements of surprise never falter. This is a kaleidoscopic celebration of freedom, of all you can do with craftsmanship, imagination, and an audience willing to join you on the journey.]]></summary>

Barcelona was largely absent from this legacy until 2019, when Italian former veterinarian and self-professed “super lover of cheese” Francesco Cerutti opened Pinullet. Claiming to be the only cheesemaker in Barcelona, Cerutti uses organic milk to produce as many as nine different varieties of cheese right in the city center. 

Every Monday, Cerutti receives a shipment of 1,000 liters of raw milk from a farm with three cows in Cardadeu, a village 40 kilometers northeast of Barcelona. Come Tuesday, the largely self-taught cheesemaker might turn this into a fresh cheese such as queso fresco, a couple Italian-style pasteurized cheeses such as mozzarella or ricotta, and three to four raw milk aged French-style cheeses such as a Camembert- or a Tomme-style cheese. He also produces yogurt and cheeses seasoned with ingredients ranging from truffles to chilies.

Cerutti’s so-called “cheese laboratory” spans a workroom, refrigerators for aging cheese, and a shopfront, where he also sells a few bottles of wine and other products, in addition to those cheeses. These days, he sells the bulk of what he produces to local restaurants.]]></summary>

Whether pumpkin pie or tiramisu, trifle or semifreddo, these desserts adhere to the mantra ‘store-bought is fine’
 If you’re not the best baker in the world, the idea of being asked to bring a dessert to your family’s holiday party can be totally overwhelming. You could, of course, just go to a neighborhood bakery and pick up a great pie or cake, but maybe this is the year you finally go out on a limb and try to make something on your own. 
And really, you don’t have to do it totally alone — as Ina Garten has famously repeated, getting a little store-bought help is fine. The following recipes are all the definition of “semi-homemade,” or dishes that require a little bit of work but also employ a lot of assistance from store-bought ingredients like pre-made…]]></summary>

But it’s very good for that.
With that in mind, our tale. Our niece traveled from Oregon with her son so that they could take in Thursday's Rams-49ers game in Santa Clara, a sort of family treat gone amusingly wrong. That should explain the schadenfreude thing. Sure, being at that soggy and miserable slog was awful for them, but at least we stayed dry and warm and drank for free.

His heart-stopping title match against Ding Liren came down to an inexplicable endgame blunder in the 14th and final game. The challenger had taken the match lead in Game 11 only to lose in Game 12, as Ding looked set to once again come from behind to win in a world championship match. All tied up going into final classical game, we looked inevitably headed for the simplest of draws when Ding blundered a technical endgame win. Gukesh took advantage and now stands astride the chess world, $1.35 million richer, as its new king.

In an ideal world, my perfume should become a Proustian madeleine of sorts. Luckily, Snif makes some nostalgic, slightly over-the-top fragrances for food-lovers (see: this eau de croissant of sorts), and its Naughty Nona fragrance — which is touted as a “booze-soaked, sugared, and spiked” perfume — sounds like everything I love about this time of year. Its top notes suggest everything some people love about fruitcake: ginger, orange, rum, walnuts. And I also peeped some (slightly intimidating) perfume subreddits, where one fan of the fragrance writes, “Naughty Nonna smells like walking into a small New York corner bake shop run by an eccentric old lady that uses the pink Dove soap bar. She knows your order and saves it for you off to the side.” Who wouldn’t want to spritz that on every day? 



No peeking! But check out what the Eater Advent Calendar has already revealed.  And check back each day for a new clutch condiment, gadget, or nibble that, yes, makes an amazing gift — but these surprises are just for you.]]></summary>

law. There is little about this substantive call with which I disagree. Yes,
courts need to do a better job of recognizing and remedying non-consequential
privacy harms (p. 113-114, 157). Yes, as a matter of institutional design,
privacy desperately needs civil liability (p. 89). And yes, much of the
proceduralized control, or consent, on which many privacy laws around the world
rely is steeped in fallacies about how people and markets behave (Ch. 3).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Located on the hillside near Granada’s city center, the Albaicín neighborhood features many historic buildings. In fact, the area is part of the UNESCO World Heritage site that includes the Alhambra. Businesses in this area tend to cater to tourists, but the Palacio de los Olvidados (Palace of the Forgotten) has taken a rather unique approach.

The 16th-century mansion sits in a narrow alleyway on the lower hillside of the neighborhood. The structure features four floors with a patio on the third floor that provides nice views of the Alhambra and a small fenced-in courtyard on the ground level. However, if the building did not operate as a tourism business, it would largely blend into the cityscape.

The ground floor of the Palacio de los Olvidados features a performance space named Palacio Flamenco. Granada is located in Andalucia, where flamenco originated from the intermingling of Muslim, Jewish, and Gitano cultures within the region, and these performances are quite popular.

The upper floors of the building feature a torture museum called the Museo de la Inquisición (Museum of the Inquisition). This space includes full replicas of many of the types of instruments of torture used during the medieval era but especially by the Spanish Inquisition after the Reconquista. The highlights include an iron maiden, a spiked interrogation chair, and a brazen bull (a metal statue of a bull where a person would be shut inside and then roasted alive by a fire lit below the statue). Additional special exhibitions are organized on the museum's top floors.

While the combination of these attractions may seem completely incongruous, this combination makes the Palacio de los Olvidados stand out from the crowd.]]></summary>

Benji was nearly 3 when he was diagnosed with severe autism and soon after started a specialized therapy to help him develop basic skills.

The night the EMTs carried Elizabeth Nakagawa from her home, bleeding and in pain, the tarp they’d wrapped her in reminded her of a body bag.
Nakagawa, 39, is a Coast Guard commander: stoic, methodical, an engineer by trade. But as they maneuvered her past her young daughters’ bedroom, down the narrow steps and into the ambulance, she felt a stab of fear. She might never see her girls again.
Then came a blast of anger. She’d been treated for a miscarriage before. She knew her life never should have been in danger.
Earlier that day, April 3, 2023, Nakagawa had been scheduled to have a surgical …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ev Williams, writing the backstory of, and raison d’être for, Mozi:
And here we are, 20+ years later, with address books full of
partial, duplicate, and outdated information. Perhaps the reason
for this is that social networks (or the social network) solved
this problem — for a while. When Facebook was ubiquitous it was
probably a pretty good reflection of many people’s real-life
relationships. It told you where they lived, who you knew in
common, and all kinds of other details.
Another idea that seemed obvious was that, given how deeply social
humans are, social products would dominate the internet. Ten to
fifteen years ago, this seemed inevitable.
But something else happened instead.
Social networks became “social media,” which, at first, meant
receiving content from people you chose to hear from. But in the
quest to maximize engagement, the timeline of friends and people
you picked to follow turned into a free-for-all battle for
attention. And it turns out, for most people, your friends aren’t
as entertaining as (god forbid) influencers who spend their
waking hours making “content.”
In other words, social media became … media.
To tell you the truth, I think there are positive aspects of this
evolution (perhaps I’ll get into that in another post). But we
clearly lost something.
This whole piece is so good, so clear. This distinction between social networking and social media is obvious in hindsight, but only in hindsight. Williams posted it on Medium (natch), but Mozi’s website links directly to it for their “About” page. I’m excited about this. I think they’re on to something here. It’s even a great name.

Yet for all the value cows have held for human beings past and present, Sinding says, “we still don't actually fully know where they came from.” All we know for certain is that cattle came from aurochs, their larger, fiercer, extinct wild ancestor. In a new study of ancient aurochs genomes published in Nature, Sinding and other researchers have shed light on the deep global ties that bind aurochs and domestic cattle with humankind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Knicks fans' fixation on Trae Young had become unseemly. Why were packs of feral bridge-and-tunnelers chanting the name of the Atlanta Hawks guard, unprompted, in regular-season blowouts of unrelated opponents? It had been three years since Young had humiliated their team in the postseason, and yet the phrase "Fuck Trae Young" had never left their lips. Sure, he held up his end of the bargain, telling visiting Knicks fans to "take y'all ass home" after a win in Atlanta last month, but their hatred still seemed disproportionate. Young seemed to have taken up residence in their heads without paying all that much in rent. At least the Hawks' 108-100 win over the Knicks in Wednesday's NBA Cup quarterfinal gave them something worth beefing about.
The Knicks seem to have specifically sought out that matchup, too. In the last game of the group stage, a front-to-back rout of the Orlando Magic, the specific point differential would determine their next opponent. If they won that game by at least 37 points—which they were capable of doing—the Knicks would have faced the Boston Celtics. So they sandbagged the last stretch of the game, letting the Magic outscore them by 16 points in the last six minutes, to line up a quarterfinal against the Hawks instead. The sarcasm from Knicks swingman Josh Hart indicated that the team knew what it was doing.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might be surprised to find a seafaring ship in landlocked Arizona. There indeed is not but this building could easily be mistaken for one, complete with its name, portholes, and an anchor on the hull. Former Casa Grande city councilman C.J. "Blinky" Wilson built this ironically shaped Moderne-style store in honor of his son, who served in the U.S. Navy. Even more peculiarly, it was reportedly designed by a prison inmate at the Arizona State Prison in nearby Florence. This arrangement was made by prison warden and local business owner Art Brooks.

From its construction in 1946 until 1981, the building housed Blinky's auto business, Wilson Motors. This is still evident in the auto bays located at the stern of the ship. Since then, it has been home to various other enterprises.

Although the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002, it has unfortunately lost many of its original details. There was once a mock smokestack and exterior staircase on top, as well as tires painted like life preservers on the railing. It has also been repainted from blue and white to a much less nautical beige.]]></summary>

Baron: If you read pieces about you — pieces of press, profile
stuff like that — from the ’80s and ’90s, even a little bit in the
2000s, you were often portrayed as miserable.
Letterman: (laughs uproariously) Yeah, that’s great. I love that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The New York Times:
George J. Kresge, who as the entertainer the Amazing Kreskin used
mentalist tricks to dazzle audiences as he rose to fame on
late-night television in the 1970s, died on Tuesday in Wayne, N.J.
He was 89. A close friend, Meir Yedid, said the death, at an
assisted living facility, was from complications of dementia.
Kreskin’s feats included divining details of strangers’ personal
lives and guessing at playing cards chosen randomly from a deck.
And he had a classic trick at live shows: entrusting audience
members to hide his paycheck in the auditorium, and then relying
on his instincts to find it — or else going without payment for
a night.
Somehow his first appearance with Letterman wasn’t until 1990, but after that he was a regular. Just a canonical “late night talk show guest” of that era. He was good at the mentalist tricks, but what made Kreskin great — amazing even — was that he was just such a weird, fun, and funny guy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the final NBA Cup quarterfinal, Houston hosted and beat Golden State in an objectively ugly, subjectively very fun 91-90 grindhouse win defined by incredible defense on both sides, yet another late-game Warriors meltdown, and Steve Kerr going totally ballistic after the loss. The game was a pretty illustrative example of a number of larger-order trends in the league this year, from both a gameplay level and broadcasting standpoint, especially at the end.
What happened is the Warriors blew it. They ripped off a trademark third-quarter burst, the only frame in which either team scored more than 25, and nursed a small lead throughout the fourth. The dynamic when the Warriors had the ball involved Golden State desperately running around trying to use Steph Curry's gravity to unzip something somewhere else in the airtight Houston defense before the Rockets forced a shot-clock violation, which they did an incredible eight times on the night (they also forced an eight-second violation). Golden State only so much as hit the rim once in the final three minutes. Houston's offense, by contrast, centered around giving Alperen Sengun the ball and letting him operate in the post. It was honest, physically punishing stuff, old-school principles applied against and alongside hypermodern basketball. Both teams are winning this year with defense and depth, which to me are the two big league-wide stories this season.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While cheering for the Buffalo Sabres has been the bleakest of all possible NHL fan choices over the past 13 years, the experience hasn't been without a few recent glimmers. Despite the league-leading playoff drought, the Sabres have managed to avoid the absolute dregs of the East by putting together a few scrappy hot streaks here and there, inspiring a bit of hope that they can steal an eight seed soon. With big-shot draft picks in Rasmus Dahlin and Owen Power, a strong vet acquired for a former big-shot draft pick in Alex Tuch, the breakout stardom of tall center Tage Thompson, the arrival of yet another young and talented defender in Bowen Byram, and an apparent solution in goal named Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen, there was a scenario in which the Sabres could perhaps take advantage of the Atlantic Division's aging top half and underachieving bottom half.
For the first chunk of this season, Buffalo didn't disabuse anyone of that notion. The Sabres won most of their games against worse teams and got breaks in a few others, which, combined with a slow start from the Boston Bruins, had them top-eight by points percentage in the East at Thanksgiving. But ever since they returned from a perfect West Coast trip for eight straight games in the state of New York, they have dutifully undone all that good work. The Sabres have lost every one of these N.Y. games, including seven in Buffalo, with the chilly spell culminating in a 3-2 defeat to the Rangers on Wednesday.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The state of New Jersey requires that online gambling operators notify gamblers when their lifetime deposits have crossed a certain dollar threshold. Small bets add up: A user might think they are wagering reasonably and not fully appreciate that over too short a period of time they've pumped a few paychecks or more into their account. So New Jersey regulations require that gambling operators freeze a user's gambling activity until the user has been confronted with the option "to self-impose responsible gaming limits" or close their account, has once again been reminded of the existence of a problem-gambling hotline, and has clicked their way through an acknowledgment. The threshold is $2,500, which seems reasonable enough. Certainly I would want to know if I'd deposited more than two thousand of my own dollars into a DraftKings account, so that I could immediately hurl myself off of a skyscraper.
A DraftKings user in New Jersey with the handle MDallo1990 hit the $2,500 deposit threshold on or about Feb. 1, 2020, according to attorney Matthew Litt, who represents the user's "separated spouse" and two children. MDallo had at that point been on DraftKings for about a month; though this would not have been his first encounter with the problem-gambling hotline number, this would've been the first time that the encounter came with a mandatory freeze on gambling, and a prompt. Unfortunately, MDallo did not immediately "self-impose responsible gaming limits" or close his account.]]></summary>

This fish's tale will be familiar to Wisconsin travelers who are used to oversized fish, and in particular, the origins of the giant catfish are similar to those of the nearby Sunny the Sunfish sculpture found slightly further south along the Great River Road in Onalaska. Although Trempealeau River and Bay are home to channel and flathead catfish, the presence of the fish has more to do with an annual festival that has come to symbolize the town: Catfish Days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve only ever listened to Godspeed You! Black Emperor’s recorded output, you’ve probably never heard “Hope Drone.” The song has no fixed form; instead, it is an evolving being, seemingly fated to live solely in the domain of live performance. You can find ample evidence of the track’s changing character online; fan-recorded bootlegs trace its many manifestations as the band’s opening number since 2010, when the Montreal-based collective reunited after a seven-year hiatus. Through those 15 years, with five recorded albums and countless live performances, “Hope Drone” has been, at once, the most consistent and ever-changing facet of the collective’s repertoire.
The word HOPE faded into view as a low bass hum emerged over the loudspeaker, announcing the imminent arrival of the band on stage at Chicago’s Salt Shed on the night of Nov. 8. Over the next dozen minutes, that one word flickered in and out on a piece of looping celluloid as the band began to shape the droning sound into something specific, imbuing the open concept with meaning. If hope is a discipline, as longtime abolitionist Mariame Kaba has taught us, then “Hope Drone” is a persistent exercise in renewing faith in a better world—the Sisyphean act of inching the boulder upwards, only to watch it fall into an abyss of violence that seems to expand each day.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the Spanish encountered cacao in Mexico in the early 16th century, Barcelona became an important transit point for the ingredient when it arrived in Europe. But xocolata, as processed chocolate is known in Catalan, didn’t become mainstream in the city until a couple hundred years later. 

Eventually, the ingredient came to be included in dishes both savory and sweet, and Barcelona gained a strong reputation for both its chocolate consumption and production. In particular, Carrer Petritxol, in the city’s Gothic Quarter, became home to several chocolate shops, lending the narrow lane the nickname of “Chocolate Street,” a history described via tile murals that line it.

Arguably the most famous of these is Granja Dulcinea, opened in 1941. Generations of locals have come here to drink xocolata a la tassa, Catalan-style hot chocolate, dark and rich—almost chocolate mousse-like—but milkier and less thick than elsewhere in Spain. If this isn’t enough, opt for the decadent suís, the “Swiss,” hot chocolate topped with a mountain of rich whipped cream, or you can pair your mug with the dense, sugar-dusted churros—perfect for dipping.

The interior is charmingly decked out in dark woods, there’s a fireplace and a small upper balcony, and all the servers are men. They also serve a variety of baked goods including ensaïmadas, a pastry of Sephardic Jewish origin from Mallorca that’s common in Barcelona.]]></summary>

revisit their examination of America’s racial orders, offering a deep dive into
the ideological battlegrounds defining the MAGA era and beyond. The book builds
on themes from Still

racial politics in the wake of the Obama and Trump presidencies. Smith and King
argue that America’s racial divide today is defined by two opposing institutional
and policy orders—the “Protect” and “Repair” alliances—each representing a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Books take a long time. Writing, editing, and publishing one is slow, laborious work. A book that is sold today probably won’t come out until 2027 at the earliest. So it makes sense that money-grubbing innovator boys have taken aim at book publishing, which is an industry full of words, and decided that the way to disrupt it is by using AI. The dweebiest of these operations is a company called Spines, whose marketing materials feature four men wearing high V-neck branded T-shirts, looking like they are about to ask you if you’re ready for your massage. Spines is planning to disrupt the book industry by publishing—say it with me—EIGHT THOUSAND BOOKS in 2025 using artificial intelligence. 
Their goal, they say, is to shrink the distance between a book being written and being published by using AI to "automate proofreading, cover design, metadata optimization and limited translation services." For $5,000, Spines claims it can have a manuscript published in three weeks. They have secured $16 million in series A funding. “We want to publish up to 8,000 books next year. The goal is to help a million authors publish their books,” Yehuda Niv, the CEO of Spines, told The Bookseller.]]></summary>

Elana Zeide

In his timely
and incisive book, The Privacy Fallacy, Ignacio Cofone critiques the
foundational assumptions of privacy regulation. He convincingly demonstrates
that privacy law’s persistent emphasis on individual control and procedural
compliance fails to grasp the true nature of privacy harm and overlooks the
systemic realities of our modern information economy.
  
Cofone
identifies what he terms the “privacy fallacy”—our legal system’s tendency to
acknowledge privacy’s intrinsic value in theory while reducing it to merely
instrumental protections focused on preventing discrete, tangible harms. This
conceptual error manifests i…]]></summary>
