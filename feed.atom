        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Burger King launches the new Crispy Onion Whopper as the latest burger spurred by its "Whopper by You" platform. The chain also brings back Cini Minis for a limited time.

The Crispy Onion Whopper features a quarter-pound, flame-grilled beef patty served with lettuce, tomato, mayo, American cheese, bacon, pickles, breaded onion rings, fried onion crisps, and BBQ sauce on a toasted sesame seed bun. For smaller appetites, it can also be ordered as a Whopper Jr.
Cini Minis are bite-sized cinnamon rolls served with a sweet icing dipping sauce. You get four in an order.
Prices vary, but a Crispy Onion Whopper is $7.99 in Los Angeles, while the Whopper Jr. version is $4.79. An order of Cini Minis is $2.49 here.
Burger King's "Whopper by You" platform solicits fan creations for potential new Whopper varieties.

        <updated>2025-08-27T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taco Bell's Cheesy Melty Grilled Steak Burrito is a value-priced offering featuring marinated grilled steak, seasoned rice, a three-cheese blend (mozzarella, cheddar, and pepper jack), reduced-fat sour cream, and Creamy Jalapeno Sauce, wrapped up in a soft flour tortilla.

I bought one for $3.29.
The burrito had a nice heft to it. It was nicely folded and tightly rolled.
There was an even, though somewhat sparse, distribution of mildly seasoned steak inside. Unfortunately, the distribution of the sour cream and Creamy Jalapeno Sauce was not so even. My initial bites of the burrito were full of sour cream, while the Creamy Jalapeno Sauce was gathered at the other end. So I was mostly tasting one sauce or the other in many bites. There's a mild heat from the Creamy Jalapeno Sauce to go with a jalapeno-inflected mayo base.



The second flavor driver of the burrito was the seasoned rice, which had a nice flavor, but I would have liked a bit more presence from the steak.
The cheeses provided a nice melt and stretch, but didn't make much of a showing in the taste department. Although it features in the name, there wasn't a whole lot of cheese to go around.



Overall, Taco Bell's Cheesy Melty Grilled Steak Burrito made for a filling meal for an affordable price. Flavor-wise, it was overly familiar and light on steak. If we were being more honest with names, it would be the "Saucy Rice Flecked with Steak Burrito."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heading into the fall, Domino's "Best Deal Ever" is back for a limited time. The promotion lets you buy "any pizza with any toppings" for $9.99 each (as long as it's not a Parmesan Stuffed Crust because that will cost you extra) at participating locations nationwide.

The $9.99 deal lets you choose from Hand Tossed, Handmade Pan, New York Style, Gluten Free, and Crunchy Thin Crust to go with various sauces and toppings.
The deal is available online only through the Domino's website or mobile app. It specifically excludes extra-large and specialty pizzas. According to the fine print, the maximum number of toppings for "any toppings" is seven (six if you're opting for a Handmade Pan or New York Style crust). The deal is available for delivery or carryout, although there is a minimum purchase requirement for delivery that varies by location.

Tequila Lime Chicken was Moe's most popular limited-time offering last year and features white-meat chicken tossed in agave sauce with a smoky blend of lime, jalapeno, and garlic--now topped with a dash of Tajin. Tajin is also available to add to any entree with no extra charge.
Moe's Queso Crunch Taco is a crunchy taco shell wrapped in a soft tortilla with a layer of queso in between them. The shell is filled with Tequila Lime Chicken, Oaxaca cheese, pico de gallo, poblano crema, and Tajin.
As a promotion for its return, Moe Rewards Members can get a free Queso Crunch Taco with the purchase of any entree through September 7, 2025, at participating locations chain-wide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Little Caesars is running a limited-time, online-only deal where you can get two large 1-topping pizzas for $4.99 each ($9.98 total) at participating locations nationwide.

The deal is available when ordering through the Little Caesars website or mobile app using the code "PIZZAPIZZA" through September 14, 2025.
The pricing is similar to the limited-time "More for $9.99" value menu that Little Caesars recently offered over the summer, but lets you choose from a wider selection of toppings.
The deal is slightly higher at $5.99 a pizza in some areas (including here in Los Angeles). The higher price also includes a slightly different code to input: "PIZZAPIZZA1". A custom 1-topping pizza normally costs $8.49 here (that makes for a discount of $2.50 per pizza).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Buffalo Wild Wings has brought back its Pick 6 meal for two, starting at $19.99, ahead of the 2025 fall football season.

The meal includes your pick of two entrees, two sides, and two fountain drinks.
The entree choices include 10 Boneless Wings (in your choice of flavor with dips and veggies), an All-American Cheeseburger, and three Crispy Chicken Dippers (Original or Spicy). The Buffalo Ranch Chicken Sandwich and Beer Cheese Cheesesteak are also available for an extra $3, while 10 Traditional Wings, a Triple-Bacon Cheeseburger, or a Honey BBQ Chicken Salad cost $5 more. 

The Spicy Chicken Dippers are a new addition to the special. They feature white-meat chicken tenders marinated in Desert Heat dry rub, tossed in a breading that includes three types of peppers, and then deep-fried. They're served with new B-Dub Dip (a creamy, tangy sauce) or a sauce of your choice. The Dippers can be tossed in a sauce or dry rub if you so choose.
Sides choices include fries, tots, or potato wedges.
The deal is available now at participating locations for a limited time. Prices may vary (it costs $24.99 here in Los Angeles).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shake Shack brings its summer BBQ menu to a close with a deal where you can get either a free Summer BBQ Sandwich with an order of $10 or more placed through the chain's website, in-Shake kiosk, or mobile app, using the code "SUMMER", through Monday, September 1, 2025, at participating locations nationwide.

Shake Shack's Summer BBQ Sandwiches include the Smoky Classic BBQ Burger, the Carolina BBQ Burger with Fried Pickles, the Smoky Classic BBQ Chicken, and the Carolina BBQ Chicken with Fried Pickles.
The Smoky Classic BBQ Burger features a quarter-pound Angus beef patty, American cheese, applewood-smoked bacon, pickles, crispy-fried onions, and classic smoky BBQ sauce, served on a toasted potato bun.
The Carolina BBQ Burger with Fried Pickles is a quarter-pound Angus beef patty, pepper jack cheese, applewood-smoked bacon, fried pickle, and tangy-sweet Carolina-style BBQ sauce, served on a toasted potato bun.
The chicken versions of the burgers swap out the beef for a crispy-fried chicken breast filet.
Prices vary, but all four sandwiches normally cost $10.99 at my local Shake Shack here in Los Angeles, which means you can buy one of the sandwiches and get the second one for free during the promotion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chewy Chips Ahoy! x Stranger Things Limited-Edition Cookies feature a chocolaty base with fudge chips and a red strawberry-flavored filling. The filling is meant to peek through cracks in the cookies in a way reminiscent of the rift entrances in the TV series.

The suggested price for a 9.9 package is $5.79, but I received this courtesy of Chips Ahoy!.



The visual "rift" effect wasn't working on my batch of cookies. Rather than the red filling showing through, the cookies just had sealed cracks across the surface, which made them more crumbly and prone to breaking than the typical batch of Chewy Chips Ahoy! cookies.



The chocolaty base had the same soft and chewy texture as regular Chewy Chips Ahoy! but with a pleasant chocolaty flavor that gave it a brownie-like feel. The fudge chips were intermittent but delivered a deeper chocolaty flavor and smooth, melty texture.
The strawberry-flavored filling was similar in texture to the creme of an Oreo, only firmer. In terms of taste, it had an enjoyable and moderate strawberry flavor that went with the chocolate of the cookie.



Taken altogether, Chewy Chips Ahoy! x Stranger Things Limited-Edition Cookies were good but not great for me. I might think differently if I were a bigger fan of chocolate strawberries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taco Bell is trying its own take on fajitas with a test of two new menu items, the Fajita Rolled Quesadilla and Fajita Street Chalupas, for a limited time at participating locations in the Milwaukee, WI area.

The two items showcase new seasoned fajita peppers & onions and a new fajita sauce.
The Fajita Rolled Quesadilla (pictured) features grilled marinated steak or slow-roasted chicken, "boldly seasoned" fajita peppers and onions, new fajita sauce, and a melted three-cheese blend that's folded in a flour tortilla, rolled, and then grilled. It carries a suggested price of $4.99.
Fajita Street Chalupas are sold in pairs. Each small Cheesy Street Chalupa shell is filled with grilled marinated steak or slow-roasted chicken, new fajita sauce, seasoned fajita peppers and onions, and a cilantro-onion blend. The suggested price per order is $5.99.
If you're curious, here's what the ingredient list for the new fajita sauce looks like: "Fajita Sauce: Soybean oil, water, distilled vinegar, jalapeno pepper (including dehydrated), roasted bell pepper, garlic (including dehydrated), egg yolk, garlic juice, contains 2% or less of: sugar, salt, ancho chili pepper*, xanthan gum, potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate (P), paprika, onion*, spice, propylene glycol alginate, citric acid, annatto extract (C), natural flavor, calcium disodium EDTA (PF). *dehydrated. Contains: Egg."
From the looks of it, the sauce is mayo-based with notes of jalapeno, bell pepper, and garlic.

        <updated>2025-08-20T18:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pizza Hut gussies up its personal pizza offerings for a limited time with the debut of new Crafted Flatzz. The chain describes the new menu items as "crispy, hand-crafted personal pizzas."

Pizza Hut Crafted Flatzz have an elongated, somewhat oval crust that's cut into eight small slices. They feature five "artisanal recipes" (which brings to mind Domino's discontinued Artisan Pizzas):


Nashville Hot Chicken - Topped with crispy-fried boneless chicken pieces with spicy Nashville Hot seasoning, fresh onions, mozzarella, and pickle-flavored ranch sauce.
Chicken Bacon Ranch - Layered with crispy-fried boneless chicken pieces, applewood-smoked bacon, ultimate ranch sauce, mozzarella, and a parmesan oregano seasoning.
The Ultimate - Topped with pepperoni, Italian sausage, caramelized onions, roasted peppers, tomatoes, sweet marinara, and mozzarella.
Three Cheese - Topped with sweet marinara, mozzarella, parmesan, Romano, and oregano.
Pepperoni Duo - Topped with classic pepperoni, cup n’ crisp pepperoni, and a savory cheese blend seasoning, over mozzarella and sweet marinara.


Additional toppings can be added for an extra charge.
Crafted Flatzz are priced at a discounted rate of $5 before 5PM daily (prices after 5PM vary by location). They're available now through November 9, 2025, at participating locations nationwide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taco Bell's twist on the classic street taco, the Cheesy Street Chalupa, returns to the menu for a limited time ahead of fall 2025.

With two to an order, Cheesy Street Chalupas (you can find my previous review of them here) feature a small Chalupa shell (fried flatbread) and a small flour tortilla with a toasty layer of melted mozzarella and pepper jack between them. Inside the shell is a choice of slow-roasted chicken or grilled marinated steak, onions, cilantro, and Jalapeno Ranch sauce. The suggested price for an order is $5.49 (they're $6.49 near me in Los Angeles).
Other new Taco Bell menu items joining the Cheesy Street Chalupas include two $3 steak burritos and Mountain Dew Baja Midnight.

You can get one for $3.29 or two for $6. There's also a combo meal that includes two Breakfast Jack Wraps, a hash brown, and a regular hot coffee for $7.99.
