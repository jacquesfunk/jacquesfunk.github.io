        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is only sort of true to say that you know what you're going to get when Donald Trump sits for a television interview. It is true in the sense that, after a decade spent alternately threatening and occupying the White House, everyone knows how he is going to act. There is some more uncertainty when it comes to what Trump is actually going to do, but even these variables aren't notably variable. He is going to act like Donald Trump, or some version of Donald Trump. This is something that can be prepared for, to some extent.
If he is being interviewed by someone from one of the television channels he likes, Trump will be drawling and digressive in his familiar toastmaster mode, the tone he puts on when he is Making Some Remarks before an audience that he senses is eager to applaud him. "A little secret," he told Fox News' Laura Ingraham while showing her around his increasingly cluttered and gilded oval office, "throughout the years, people have tried to come up with a gold paint that would look like gold. And they've never been able to do it." No, Ingraham agreed, in a tone of hushed awe, while the Fox camera focused on a dorky little golden cherub above a door. "That's why it's gold." He sounds like he's talking in his sleep, murmuring through a dream in which he is doing exactly this sort of thing. That's one version.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Long-suffering" in a sporting context is largely nonsense, for the very simple reason that the people who complain about it are doing no suffering whatsoever. They're choosing to watch an unaccomplished team, and that's all. We don't need to run down the list of people who are actually suffering, given that the list is growing hourly, but it surely isn't sports fans. In other words, please take time out of your busy and productive days to shut the hell up. 
Besides, suffering even in this milieu is entirely an eye-of-the-beholder deal. New York Knicks fans suffer far less than, say, Charlotte Hornets/ Bobcats/Hornets Again fans, who since losing their original team in 2002, have gotten a new one, missed the playoffs 18 of 21 years, and lost the only three series they have ever played in. Next to this, the prototypical Knicks fan suffers only because of their own idiotic expectations. The notion that because they haven't won a title in 52 years means they're due is exactly the way gamblers go broke.]]></summary>

The fistic windfall kicks off tonight with a poorly planned and bizarrely promoted but intriguing-as-all-getout three-fight, Saudi-sponsored pay-per-view outdoor card at Times Square in New York, with a feature match pitting Ryan Garcia coming back from a PED suspension and intoxicant-addled haze to face Rolly Romero for a welterweight world championship belt. Then on Saturday, boxing's top international draw, Mexico's Canelo Alvarez, celebrates another Cinco de Mayo season in the ring in Riyadh, boxing's new Las Vegas, where he'll fight perhaps the most anonymous champion extant, William Scull, for a super middleweight title. And the capper, maybe best bout of 'em all, comes Sunday in the old Las Vegas, as Japanese KO king Naoya Inoue brings his powers to the west to face Ramon Cardenas for the undisputed junior featherweight championship.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TOKYO — Last year, when I visited Major League ballparks in Philadelphia and Minnesota for the first time, I made the same obvious-but-still-true observation: "It looks like it does on TV." Well, Korakuen Hall feels like it does on TV, or at least, on the Japanese wrestling streams I watch on my laptop: unadorned, practical, dignified. Arriving at Tokyo's wrestling epicenter last month, my brain still reeling from an international flight that had landed only the night earlier, I had a hard time distinguishing between my actual presence and the idea that I might be dreaming the whole thing. It was as if the setting had sprung out of two dimensions. The simple bleachers; the "East" and "West" signs, in kanji and English, on either end; the small balconies with banners hanging from them—I had seen it all before, kind of. I had never been within 5,000 miles of it, yet this was a room I knew intimately.
I went to Tokyo, basically, to see Korakuen Hall. I'm about to turn 30, and I have the normal feelings about that. Plus, I'd never traveled internationally except to Canada. I wanted to mark the big 3-0, and also see what it was like out there. So I did some big-time flying around the Pacific, the majority of it by myself, with a few specific destinations in mind. It was an amazing trip, one that affirmed my confidence in my resourcefulness and independence while also reminding me of my incredible luck. But I really think the crown jewel of it all—four cities in four different countries on three continents—was the pro wrestling. I went to three shows at Korakuen—plus one mini-adventure to the outlying wrestling shed Shin-Kiba 1st Ring to see an intimate show from the deathmatch promotion Freedoms—and this building that I had admired from so far away, miraculously, gave me exactly what I was hoping to find.]]></summary>

Final Fantasy VII is one of the most important video games in history. The game, which came out in 1997, was the first Final Fantasy to go 3D and use 32-bit graphics, a departure from the 16-bit style of (the phenomenal) Final Fantasy VI. It sold beyond anyone's wildest expectations, notching over a million sales in its first week, and introduced a host of players to the series, which had been consistently excellent but perhaps overlooked in the West. And its story, an environmentalist fable that cast the player as part of an eco-terrorist group called Avalanche, was simple yet masterfully executed. For fans of Japanese role-playing games, Final Fantasy VII was manna from heaven, a guiding step forward for the genre.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neither of the Knicks and Pistons ever really channeled the necessary competence to win their first-round playoff series in convincing fashion, and so its outcome was largely left to the bounces of fate. The series, which ended 4-2 in favor of the Knicks after last night's 116–113 victory, could have just as easily gone the other way had a few moments (and one particularly big one) unfolded differently. The same can be said about a lot of playoff series, though, and what usually ends up making the difference are the players who can cut through the randomness at the right time.
Jalen Brunson, who finished with 40 points on 15-of-33 shooting in Game 6, does not always feel like one of those players. He is undoubtedly one of the best clutch performers in the league, but his style of play often makes it feel like he is guided through those moments not by athletic genius, but a intrinsic Mr. Magoo–style talent for ending up where he needs to be. At its worst, this looks like a lot of flopping. At its best, this looks like Brunson dribbling and jump-stopping himself into trouble, and then using his incredible footwork and body control to force open a shooting angle that didn't previously exist. Watching this series mostly left me with the certainty that Brunson would drive me absolutely insane if he was playing against my team. Stop letting him do that stuff! He's too tiny for that!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a child, Claire Sneed had a morbid fascination with natural disasters. In first grade, she followed NOAA's online storm tracker. Later she witnessed Hurricanes Irene and Sandy sweep past her home in the Philadelphia area. On visits to Santa Fe to see her grandfather, Sneed marveled at the dramatic cliffs of Bandelier National Monument, which were formed by staggering volcanic explosions a million years ago. In 2000, a prescribed fire escaped, whipped by high winds, and eventually burned around 1,000 acres across the monument. Sneed was fascinated by how such a massive landscape was altered by wildfire. "I think it was just a combination of how powerless you feel in the sense when you're met with natural disasters," she said. "There's a lot of resilience, both in the natural world and in human communities, that comes together after natural disasters."
While in college, Sneed spent her summer breaks working on AmeriCorps programs in the West. She worked on wilderness trail crews clearing fallen trees, constructing bridges, and repairing trails affected by wildfire and erosion in Colorado. "All of that was trail crew related work, but I kind of fell in love with public lands," she said. After Sneed graduated in May 2024, she started a permanent seasonal position as a hydrologic technician at Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming. There, she worked to ensure streams, rivers, and wetlands complied with environmental regulations like the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, a designation that determines how much water can be removed from a river sustainably.]]></summary>

Let me back up. It was about a decade ago, at some open house event at my neighborhood arts center, and someone had brought a telescope. I don't think he worked there; I think he just liked bringing his telescope places and letting people look through it. It wasn't even a particularly large telescope, to my eye: easily portable, set up on a tripod, and with a line of just two or three people waiting to use it. Can I look?, I asked, stupidly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As if in response to my minor complaint about the cagey first leg of the Arsenal vs. Paris Saint-Germain Champions League semifinal, the other semifinal, between Barcelona and Internazionale, served as a stark counterpart. A wide-open 3-3 thriller, up there with the best first-leg knockout matches of the tournament's last decade, had almost too much action to recap. The goals came hard and fast, and with almost otherworldly quality, from both sides, and Inter especially weathered a furious storm to pick its spots and send the tie back to Italy for the second leg all knotted up.
That's not to say, though, that all the goals, or even all the performances, were created equal. If ever a six-goal masterpiece could be distilled down to the exploits of one player, it was Wednesday's match. That player was, as it already has been in big-ticket showdowns and as it looks like it might be for years to come, Lamine Yamal, Barcelona's 17-year-old (17!) winger who isn't just the best prospect in the world by a mile; he might already be the best player on the planet, a whirlwind of technical prowess and creativity that European soccer hasn't seen since, well, another teenager suited up in the same club's colors.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In April, after months of tech-dipshit palace intrigue, photos of Mark Zuckerberg’s long-rumored D.C. mansion finally spread their way through social media. Because Zuckerberg is an immensely disliked figure for democracy-destroying and culture-annihilating reasons, mass architectural criticism was equally swift.
To social media users, the house looked like everything from a dorm at a mid-sized state college to, well, a McMansion—which it is, in spirit. The building itself, designed by long-time domestic architect for various elites, Robert Gurney, is not particularly flamboyant, at least as far as rich people's houses are concerned. (Certainly it lacks the foam appliques so beloved by Donald Trump.) Clad monotonously in red brick, it features a central pared-down gable complete with a garage-door-esque picture window, flanked on either side by similarly gabled and frankly barn-like wings, each connected by breezeways.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Minnesota Timberwolves eliminated the higher-seeded Los Angeles Lakers Wednesday night, in Game 5 of their first-round series. The final score, 103–96, suggests a closely fought contest, but what it really shows is the Timberwolves missing way more than the usual number of three-pointers, plus, sure, some dignity in defeat from the Lakers. Minnesota led, in Los Angeles, for every minute of the first half, and often by double digits; the Lakers scrambled back in the third quarter, but Minnesota just eased away without a whole lot of extraordinary effort down the stretch of the fourth. You had the sense, by the end, that if these teams played for another two or six or 30 games, the Wolves would spend the bulk of the time ahead by 11 points, with some wobbles in there to account for streaky shooting.
Lately, when the Timberwolves win, you expect it to be because Anthony Edwards did something cool, or possibly even incredible. It's hard sometimes even to imagine how this year's Timberwolves win games without their All-NBA shot-creator creating and making lots of shots for himself. When they edged the Lakers in Game 4, it was largely because Edwards manufactured a huge fourth quarter against an exhausted Lakers lineup missing any semblance of rim protection. Not so Wednesday: Edwards made just five shots in 42 minutes in Game 5, bricked all 11 of his three-point attempts, and finished with just 15 points, tied for his fifth-lowest scoring output of the entire season. He scored just once in the fourth quarter, and made it to the free-throw line not at all. That is not to say he played poorly—Edwards grabbed 11 rebounds on the night and was credited with eight assists, did not turn the ball over even once, and had a game-high three steals—but the Wolves never got, and in the end never needed, one of his big signature scoring explosions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FLUSHING, N.Y. — To be honest, I wanted to see Corbin Carroll and Juan Soto have a game. I was faintly aware of the Arizona Diamondbacks bravely holding up the rear of the competitive teams in the NL West (four of them!), but during an obligatory pre-game database check, I learned that Carroll was having an obscene start. Per FanGraphs, he has been the second-best position player this season; per a cursory glance at Baseball Savant sliders, he had pivoted from a hitting profile traditional to players primarily described as "fast"—above-average plate discipline that'll get a guy on base well enough—to a faster swing and strikeout-happier approach that could—could!—mean he's now a bona fide slugger who also happens to be extremely fast. Meanwhile for Soto, it was a bit simpler: Surely he was due a game at this point.
In the way these things usually go, I got neither. Carroll went 0-for-4. Soto, despite two smoked line drives into the outfield, went 0-for-3 with a walk. The game itself carried little tension. In spite of David Roth doomposting in Slack about the post-blog Mets being struck down by possible season-ending surgery and a stomach bug, the lineup smacked around Diamondbacks starter Eduardo Rodríguez in the third and fourth inning to rack up a near-unloseable 7–0 lead. At that point, for the underprepared game-goer trembling in the Citi Field 500-level like a chihuahua that more closely resembles a stick insect than a dog, the only rooting interests were for some highlights to get pumped up about, and a kind ending time with respect to the NJ Transit train schedule.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As any broadcast crew will point out the second he starts cooking, Jamal Murray owns a strange and wondrous NBA distinction: No player increases their scoring average more between the regular season and playoffs than Murray does. One can interpret that stat a number of ways, including asking the logical question of why someone who is so mission-critical to the Denver Nuggets winning anything serious can barely play himself onto all-star snub lists, but Murray's masterclass performance in Tuesday's Game 5 against the Los Angeles Clippers provided insurmountable evidence that his game is built for the biggest moments.
Murray dropped 43 points on 26 shots, adding three steals, seven assists, and five boards—according to Basketball Reference's holistic game-score stat, his second-best postseason performance ever—and was comfortably the best player on the floor, as James Harden and Nikola Jokic neutralized each other, Kawhi Leonard was Fine, and Ivica Zubac had a good game on his government-mandated supply of six-foot half-hooks and putbacks. Everyone seemed, if not nervous, then exhausted from the mental and physical strain of the series, a conference-final wolf in first-rounder's clothing.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If—if!—one wanted to identify a trend, one might point out the successive results in the Maple Leafs–Senators series. In Game 1 the Leafs dominated. Games 2 and 3 required overtime to settle, with Toronto winning both. Game 4 also went to prolongation, this time with Ottawa finally breaking through. Tuesday night's Game 5 was a mostly comfortable 4-0 Sens win. Using my elite pattern recognition, honed by millions of years of evolution, I could note that the Senators have played increasingly well in each game, and the Maple Leafs increasingly worse. Ottawa's scoring by game is a line trending only up, while Toronto's veers dirtward.
And if—if!!!—I chose to retreat to my mind palace to catalog and cite past events for the purposes of providing context for this series, I might reflect upon the fact that the Maple Leafs have a history of choking to death, especially in the first round, often against objectively less talented teams that nonetheless stop fearing them as the series moves along and the Leafs fail to clinch when the opportunity is available. Why, I might even observe that their core is 1-13 in series-clinching games, and 0-6 at home. I'm not saying any of this means the Leafs are gonna blow it again! I am not saying that. I'm just noticing things.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the removal of the away goals rule, Champions League match-ups have tended towards more open play and riskier attacks in search of goals, particularly in the first legs. It makes sense. Without away goals hanging on the home team's head, it can push forward more often, knowing that giving up a goal is merely bad instead of potentially catastrophic. With that in mind, though, the first leg of the first semifinal, the one between Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain, felt more like a match from the away goals era.
In part this is because of the lateness of this tie in the competition. It is only natural for both clubs to play conservatively, not wanting to fall right on the doorstep of the final (this is also why most, though not all, Champions League finals tend to be a bit underwhelming as actual matches), and so the order of the day for both the host Gunners and the visiting Parisians appeared to be safety. The other reason, however, is that PSG scored its first half-chance on a day of half-chances, a goal that immediately changed the complexion of the whole tie just four minutes in, and one that showed the difference between the two sides, particularly in attack.]]></summary>

She grew up going to the beach and going with her grandparents to see Shamu—"which I obviously realize now is not the kind of value system I have when it comes to animal care," Miller caveats. But she wasn't sure if she wanted to pursue science—she dreamed of being on Broadway—until a teacher told her she had what it takes.
Miller, a first-generation college student, initially struggled in university. "I was a terrible test-taker, and my first year my grades just were not great," she said. "I really thought, like, I'm not going to be able to do this." But then a professor offered Miller the chance to work in her lab studying the environmental DNA—genetic material shed by animals in their environment—of creatures like lionfish and salamanders. This experience in the lab cemented Miller's passion for biology, as well as her confidence that she could make it in the field.]]></summary>

He had accomplished what no Florida Gators men's basketball coach had in nearly two decades—a national championship—bringing a title home to a university and a fan base desperate for a win. (The last national championship for Florida in football or basketball came in 2008, just a year after Apple announced the iPhone.) All those years of disappointment later, the scene played out exactly as it was supposed to. Florida players hugged and cried. Fans screamed. The marching band blasted the university fight song. Play-by-play broadcaster Ian Eagle called out on the TV broadcast a slight twist on the phrase every Florida student learns, "It's a great day to be a Gator!"
And it was. The streets of Gainesville filled with jubilant students. The university's social media accounts boasted and bragged. Alumni young and old swelled with pride. All the years of losing, of coming up short, of watching other schools hoist trophies was swept away—as was any public memory of the two investigations involving two Florida basketball coaches: head coach Golden and one of his assistants, Gators legend Taurean Green.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Curzio Malaparte was the shape-shifting Zelig of the catastrophe of Italian fascism, a political and social operator of such profound equivocation that in his writings he seems almost to convince even himself of his own sincerity. In Maurizio Serra’s comprehensive biography, first published in Italian in 2011 and now available in English from New York Review Books, we follow Malaparte’s skittering movements across a century to which he seems uniquely suited and yet, near daily, increasingly familiar to our own. 
Best known for his nightmarish 1944 novel of the Second World War, Kaputt, Malaparte—a novelist, journalist, playwright, diplomat, and filmmaker—wrote like a cross between Ernst Jünger and Thomas Pynchon, and lived like a daredevil prince. He was forever on the move, forever aggrieved, forever on the verge of world fame, even immortality, or, at the very least, slipping through whatever net was closing around him. He began his adult life as a fascist and became a communist in his later years (a conversion he seemed to think was more a shift of emphasis—his first book, 1931’s Coup d’Etat: The Technique of Revolution, argued that it was Mussolini’s own youthful Marxism that had made him such an effective revolutionary), before embracing Catholicism on his deathbed in 1957.]]></summary>

The Rockies had two men on, and Atlanta's Bryce Elder threw a big fat cement-mixer of a slider, and Goodman put some mighty wood to it. Rockies play-by-play guy Drew Goodman (unrelated) couldn't immediately accept that something had happened to cause the home team to have more runs than the opposition. Here is the proof:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One reason the NBA Playoffs are great is that the postseason's competitive structure and tactical complexity make something like the Buddy Hield Game not only possible, but necessary.
The Golden State Warriors won a thriller in San Francisco on Monday night to take a 3–1 lead in their first-round series against the offensively inept and defensively murderous Houston Rockets, and they did so despite a straight-up bad game from Steph Curry. Watch any of the first three games from this series, and consider the state of Jimmy Butler's ass, and you would come to the logical conclusion that the Warriors were not set up to win any less-than-stellar Curry game, let alone a game in which Fred VanVleet made eight three-pointers. Unless Curry is forcing double-teams and bending Houston's strong, flexible defensive structure, Golden State's offense is largely incapable of making the Rockets sweat. Draymond Green, once and occasionally still a good passer, has been excised from the attack, and on Monday, Curry didn't have it.]]></summary>

Go listen to it. Better yet, go watch the video. It’s super simple. It’s black and white and it’s basically just Adebimpe shouting this perfect song into his mic all in black—those muscles, that bleached hair—and a woman (dancer Brooke Shepherd) in white bouncing and flailing around a massive amp with her supernaturally long arms clapping, thighs pumping, dreads flying. It’s the perfect dance, whatever it is, for this perfect music, whatever it is. Every time it ends, I have the impulse to turn it right back on again. It feels like life. Or like life’s supposed to feel. “I was thinkin' 'bout my time in space/I was thinkin' 'bout the human race/In the age of tenderness and rage/Had me kickin' through the end of days.” If you’re not writing this as the opening to your opening song, why’re you even bothering?
My favorite part, right before the chorus, right after Adebimpe sings, “We’re gonna crash your matrix/And how you gonna feel about that?" has him following up with: “Why you wanna come like that”—and then a big, long pause—“for.” The chorus goes nuts. “Magnetic” is a great representative for this entire album, which gives space to whatever it wants.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Steve Cohen bought the New York Mets near the end of the 2020 season, he acquired a property that was valuable, scarce, and absolutely lousy with toxic mold and crawling with skunks. The value was easy to see; there are only so many Major League Baseball franchises and they're not making new ones at the moment, which makes this both a good business to be in and one that doesn't do much to discourage the sort of laziness that led to those unaddressed mold/skunk issues under previous ownership. It is more difficult and more persistently demanding to be a smart baseball organization than a stupid one, and far more cost-effective in the long run, but from an owner's perspective it doesn't really make much of a difference. Smart teams win and dumb teams mostly don't, but owners do fine either way; the family that spent the better part of two decades making the Mets as mediocre and repellent as they could possibly be banked $2 billion in profit from the sale of the property they'd desecrated.
That sour mediocrity was the result not of a lack of effort, but of a heroic surplus of the worst and wrongest kinds of effort; neglect would have been a marked improvement upon the sort of toxic attention the owners lavished upon the organization. It wasn't that the Wilpons didn't want to win; they did, but only if it meant that the dumb things they cared about—a crabbed half-ideology devoted to various antique and idiotic rules and hierarchies, except when and where it was dictated by patronage or some salty executive whim—to be winning things, when they were not.]]></summary>

The Wolves erased a 12-point third-quarter deficit and won the game by a single bucket; with the victory they pulled into a 3–1 series lead over the higher-seeded Lakers, who are now a loss away from elimination. Worse, perhaps, than James's failure to score was Los Angeles's difficulty even getting him opportunities: The NBA's all-time leading scorer—fresh off a regular season in which he averaged 24.4 points per game on an outrageous 64 percent true shooting—attempted just two field goals in the fourth quarter of the most important game of his team's season.

And in Montreal on Sunday night, stimulated by two dramatic events late in the second period, the Habs' arena swelled to the point of deafening, with a force that made me believe the home team might really have the power to knock out the No. 1 seed in the East. But after a giddy intermission under the banner of a 2-1 score, Canadiens fans watched—and I listened—helplessly as the prospect of a tied series was ripped away by a ruthless and experienced Washington Capitals group that took the breaks the local boys couldn't.
First, the high point. With two minutes to go in the second and the score 1-1, a Capitals player was sent the box for one of several hits on both sides that got punished by the refs throughout a particularly physical game. But this wasn't just any player: This was the Greatest Goal Scorer Of All Time™, Alexander Ovechkin, who took the two for interference by trucking Jake Evans at the edge of the Caps' attacking zone. The Quebecois screams, shouts, and boos overwhelmed the announcement of the penalty, and for good reason. The newly crowned scoring king entering the sin bin for the first time in almost two months felt like an event in itself—the kind of rare, odd misstep that can doom a favorite in a tricky series.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Milwaukee Bucks got smoked by the Indiana Pacers in Game 4 on their home court, in a loss that felt less like ending a chapter and more like slamming a book shut, incinerating it, and purging the memory of ever having read it. They are now down 3–1 to a team that has proved matchup poison for them even in the best of times; Giannis Antetokounmpo's game is stretched as thin as his patience; they have swiftly degraded from a team with a strong identity to a team about nothing, playing yesterday's game with yesterday's players. Their only other good player just wrecked his leg, they handed their archrival a title in pursuing said good player, and because of that, they have no future. Four years after the Bucks won a championship, things are looking unimaginably bleak in Milwaukee.
Halfway through the first quarter of Sunday's Game 4, Damian Lillard burst forward to tap an offensive rebound to the corner, then crumpled and instantly grabbed at the back of his left leg. As of this writing he has not received an official diagnosis, but everyone in the know is reporting that he probably did in his Achilles. With Lillard in the lineup, the Bucks had an essentially even point differential, with his 24.9 points per game being largely canceled out by his inability to even contain anyone with a live dribble. Still, they needed his offensive dynamism in the playoffs, because without him, the offense funnels to Bobby Portis and Kevin Porter Jr., and that's if the Bucks are lucky enough not to be dragged into a Kyle Kuzma game. Antetokounmpo is still the best player in this series, but everything he gets is very tough, and Indiana's extremely connected defense is never really stressed out by anything he does—again, because his team is butt.]]></summary>

Well, yes, but there's nothing quite like winning the club's record-tying 20th first-division title in front of a roaring Anfield crowd, as Liverpool found out on Sunday. Despite getting the Premier League trophy monkey off its back in the COVID-delayed 2019-20 season, Liverpool finished this season, the first after Jürgen Klopp and the first under Arne Slot, in style, shrugging off some cup disappointments with the one trophy that, for this club, means more than any other. Thanks to a comprehensive 5-1 victory over middling Tottenham, Anfield got its long-awaited party on Sunday, and now Liverpool once again sits atop its historic perch as the most successful club in English soccer history.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Texas Rangers found an excellent way to lose a baseball game Sunday night. Or, if they didn't find it or invent it, they at least deserve recognition for having iterated this delightful method. They were tied at two runs apiece with the San Francisco Giants in the bottom of the ninth inning, in what had been a somewhat choppy and frustrating game for both teams. Heliot Ramos of the Giants squibbed a first-pitch slider from Rangers reliever Luke Jackson; the ball left Ramos's bat at 58.7 miles per hour and traveled maybe 50 feet onto the left side of the infield grass. This is not what you want from whoever is leading off a late inning, but to Ramos's credit, he at least tore ass up the first-base line, forcing Jackson to attempt a quick and athletic play.
This is where things first went bad. Jackson, whose pitching motion has him falling off the mound toward first base, raced back the other way to field the ball on the move. Ramos was chugging. A wiser fielder might've pocketed this baseball and lived to fight another day. Jackson felt the pressure to make a play. He grabbed the ball bare-handed, rolled his throwing shoulder under his upper body, and almost blindly fired the ball to first, against his momentum and while crashing onto his back. It would've been an incredible, highlight out, except that Jackson's throw was really nowhere close, sailing up the field and well out of the reach of first-baseman Jake Burger. The ball bounced at the edge of the outfield and rolled away. Disaster!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Give the Kings and Oilers this: Their commitment to never making anything easy has led to some pretty great TV. The games in this first-round series have mostly followed the same basic outline. The Kings nab a multi-goal lead; the Oilers score a couple to get back in it. The moments where the game scripts have differed—why the series is tied 2-2 rather than already decided, in either team's favor—have all come in act 3, and have hinged on whether L.A. can close out what it started, or whether Edmonton has enough time left for its furious late-game rallies. Neither is a particularly envious position to be in. But all else being equal, I'd rather be the team that gets better as games wear on rather than the one that mostly seems to get tired.
The Oilers took Game 4 in Edmonton 4-3 in overtime Sunday night, by—what else?—a multi-goal, third-period comeback. It doesn't even get to the extra frame without Quinton Byfield failing to clear the puck and instead turning it over to Evan Bouchard with under a minute left. I'll chalk it up to being gassed—heavy legs and low oxygen levels make for bad decisions and worse execution—and Byfield, who's going to be a huge star if he's not there already, ended up playing a whopping 38 shifts in this one, most among forwards on either team. But fail to clear he did, and Bouchard scored his second unanswered of the period to tie things up.]]></summary>

During the early stages of Shedeur Sanders's unexpectedly protracted draft experience, he was faked out by a phone call on Friday from someone pretending to be New Orleans Saints general manager Mickey Loomis. "We're going to take you with our next pick right here, man," the caller said. "But you're going to have to wait a little bit longer, man. Sorry about that." As pranks go, this was mostly confusing; Sanders's response to the call was to ask the guests at his draft party, "What does that mean?" While it was just one of many indignities heaped upon Sanders during the draft, the call was inarguably the rudest.
On Sunday, the culprit was identified: Jax Ulbrich, the 21-year-old son of Atlanta Falcons defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich. Presumably the NFL's investigation was pretty efficient, because these idiots recorded themselves making the prank call and put it online. Here's the call from both sides:]]></summary>

Not, "In a just world, David Guthrie calls that foul," even though he performed that rarest of mea culpae: the official's admission of doctrinal error. This may seem like a needle's-eye distinction, but we're not here to indulge a rant about bad officiating. If that's you, you deserve to drink alone, outside. In a hailstorm. In Scotland.
But we're also willing to say that in a just world, Cade Cunningham makes that 14-footer seven seconds earlier, and the Pistons beat the Knicks, 95-94. Not because we care about the Pistons, or for that matter the Knicks. In a good and entertaining series, the team that is behind should always tie the series up to increase the chances of Game 7 Christmas, and Knicks-Pistons is indeed that. That New York survived Sunday, 94-93, and took a 3-1 lead over Detroit is not good, not good at all, because it could make Game 5 on Tuesday the clincher, and there has never been a seven-game series that ends in five that has been worth a damn or remembered as anything special.]]></summary>

"I’m built for whatever today may bring," the quarterback prospect tweeted. After the first round ended without a team picking Sanders, the gag wrote itself: What about tomorrow? When nobody selected him in the second or third rounds on Friday, and a prank caller interrupted his live-streamed draft party to deliver false hope, it all became a bit sad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The numbers and the highlights agree: The Minnesota Wild's top line is the league's most dangerous right now. High-scoring wingers Matt Boldy and Kirill Kaprizov, centered by Joel Eriksson Ek, are dominating play every minute they're on the ice, outshooting opponents 21-13 at 5-on-5 and outchancing them 26-11. This is no mean feat coming largely against Vegas's own formidable first line of Barbashev-Eichel-Stone, all of whom have yet to score a point through three games of the series. The Wild forwards are imposing their will in every zone, and executing on a level that makes even their most optimistic efforts result in legitimate chances.
If you're not watching the Minnesota Wild because of their historic Minnesota Wildness, you're missing out on some of the most confident offensive hockey being played. Take this saucer breakout from Kaprizov on Tuesday, which Boldy called "the best pass I've ever seen."]]></summary>

They are to be trusted with good fortune the way Pete Hegseth is to be trusted with troop deployments.
Yet with Thursday’s 3-2 overtime win over the Senators in Game 3 of the Great Ontario Wank they have become the first team to take a 3-0 series lead, and toward that end have taken a 3-0 lead in a four-game series for only the second time since Canada became fully independent from Queenie Liz in 1982. The Leafs are Canada's team and Canada's banana peel, because the playoffs are their goal and their undoing, and have been since 1967.]]></summary>

Some 200,000 people showed up to watch what is ultimately a boring product, only slightly more interesting than Marvel livestreaming a bunch of chairs with actors' names on it. But the draft thrives as an event for two reasons: 1) it sells hope, and sports fans love hope 2) it makes for a long TV broadcast, and the league loves its long TV broadcasts, so much so that it will go out of its way to lengthen the proceedings through brute geographical force.

In the absence of play, there has still been some action: The league announced plans to expand to Vancouver next season, at a press conference this week. But people around the PWHL have come to question the breaks, which accommodate an international tournament schedule designed before the league existed. “It's a long three weeks,” Marie-Philip Poulin told The Canadian Press, adding that it might make more sense to reschedule the international tournaments so they are not happening, say, right in the middle of a playoff push. 
If nothing else, the break makes for a fun, weird wrench in the season. For the league-leading Montréal Victoire, whose games before the break were tense and sluggish, maybe it was needed. For the New York Sirens, winners of back-to-back regulation games before the break, maybe it was ill-timed. When teams take the ice again, all of them but Montréal still vying for the spot in the four-team playoff, they'll have three regular-season games left to play before the postseason starts.]]></summary>

The suit said the two began "a rocky consensual relationship" that lasted nearly two years, but Sharpe became increasingly controlling and violent as time went on. Sharpe choked and hit her on multiple occasions, the suit said, and also threatened to kill her for accusing him of infidelity and resisting his sexual advances.

It was the sound of Drew, on his way back from vacation, making the NFL Draft chime at peak volume as he prepared to return to the podcast in time for the beginning of the draft. Drew loves it enough for the both of us and also a decent number of you all as well, so there was no way that we weren't going to Talk Football upon his return from Puerto Rico. After a brief discussion of his vacation misadventures, highlighted by him groaning through watching Gabriel Iglesias complain about wokeism and pronouns, and immediately after a stirring a capella version of that very same NFL Draft chime from Drew, we did just that.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is a backhanded compliment: The Houston Rockets have been one of the most fascinating teams in the league all year. The competitive dynamic of basketball is changing, and the Rockets epitomize the trajectory of that shift, with their deep rotation of committed hellraisers and one of the game's category-busting Thompson twins. What fascinates is that they won 52 games with depth, cussed determination, and an objectively bad half-court offense. 
The Rockets have built an incredible roster, stocked with all the sorts of players needed to win big except for the most important one. That deviant style stuff is fun and cool and has not tended to work in the playoffs, where defenses lock in and erase a lot of easy effort buckets. What matters here, to be reductive, is how good your best perimeter offensive player is. How relieving for Houston then that Jalen Green had himself a fantastic Game 2.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TORONTO — For a moment, there was silence. Not even two minutes into AFC Toronto's inaugural match in the National Super League, Canada's brand new professional women's soccer league, Tanya Boychuck had taken advantage of a nervy mistake to put Montréal Roses FC ahead 1–0. Boychuck was stunned, and so was the sold-out crowd at BMO Field. The hush was biting, but it was soon replaced by what had been there before the goal: singing. 
The song was coming from section 114, where the Vermilion Vanguard stood. The Vanguard is a new independent supporters' group founded by a dedicated set of AFC Toronto fans. It was a windy day at the lakeside, but their chants of "A-F-C TOR-ONT-O," to the tune of the chords of "Seven Nation Army" by the White Stripes, were clear enough for me to hear them from the press box.]]></summary>

O'Malley first learned about the NRCS as an undergraduate. The agency, which is a part of the United States Department of Agriculture, helps landowners conserve their natural resources. He studied biological systems engineering, which would allow him to focus his work on helping farmers and agricultural producers achieve a more sustainable relationship with their land. To him, working for the NRCS would mean "looking towards the public good and working with typically smaller farmers who don't have access to the same type of inputs and opportunities that larger commercial farms do, helping them succeed, and doing it in a way that also helps the land."]]></summary>

I’m one of those people now. For nearly two decades, I have treated some of the primary actors in the NFL Draft process—the anonymous scouts, the combine interrogators, the Andy Benoits—with the disdain that they have richly deserved. These are the people who, come early spring, fill the great sucking void in the NFL news cycle with their pettiest gripes regarding top prospects. Before he was drafted first overall and went on to have a borderline Hall of Fame career, Cam Newton accounted for some of the most truly deranged pre-draft analysis I’ve ever had the displeasure of reading. You probably remember those Cam takes, just as you remember Bill Polian suggesting that Lamar Jackson should play wideout, or Mike Mayock publicly marveling at Andrus Peat’s bubble butt. All of these men were not only socially ignorant, but often quite wrong about the very men they were attacking. I enjoyed being above them.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd rather gaze directly upon the opening of the Ark of the Covenant than spend too much time looking at Stuart Skinner's horrid numbers in the early (but getting late fast) postseason going. The Oilers goalie has allowed 11 goals on just 58 shots over, functionally, five and a half periods, surrendering six to the Kings in a wild Game 1 and five Wednesday night before being yanked for Calvin Pickard. Pickard promptly allowed a goal on the first shot he faced, which, if it was a salve to Skinner's wounded pride, was gifted not netminder-to-netminder, but by an Edmonton defense that is playing like it holds a grudge against its own backstop.
Pickard will almost surely get the start in a must-have Game 3 back in Edmonton, after the Kings took care of business, 6-2. I am not convinced it will matter. "No team in this league can give up the amount of Grade As and high-danger chances that we've been giving up," Darnell Nurse said. "We've been hanging our goalie out to dry."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is possible to accurately calculate the Philadelphia Phillies' record based only on the current state of the team's NBC Sports Philadelphia postgame show, but doing so requires context: It is late April, and the Phillies have just gotten swept by the Mets, who, in the interest of not burying the lede, currently have the best record in all of Major League Baseball; and we are talking about Philly local sports media. So while, say, a 10–15 record would be a perfectly reasonable guess for the day after a postgame commentator asks if it's "time to sound the alarm," astute advanced models will be sure to recalibrate to a much more average 13–12. Which happens to actually be the team's record! Congratulations to all parties involved.
John Kruk, Phillies color commentator and noted voice of reason, tried his best to slow the show's roll. "I don't know how you make up three games in 130 games left, or 130-something games left," he said on Tuesday night, sarcastically, in response to the sound-the-alarm question. "It's going to be tough when the season's winding down like it is." (At the time, the Phillies had 138 games left to play.) He continued, "My God, what are we talking about?" An excellent philosophical question, as initially posed by Raymond Carver: What do we talk about when we talk about late-April baseball?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Against the Dodgers last night, the Cubs gave up three runs in the top of the first, scored five runs in the bottom of the first, and none of it really mattered, because what happens at the beginning of a Cubs game has little bearing on what happens at the end. There is no lead so great it can’t be frittered away. There is no deficit too imposing. In the span of five days, they’ve won two of the wackiest games of the MLB season to stay on top of the NL Central. “It’s a fun team to watch play, that’s what I’d tell you,” manager Craig Counsell said after Tuesday’s 11-10 walk-off win, wearing a slightly rattled and unconvincing smile.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been more than 60 years since the first Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue hit newsstands, a moment in history that bound the business of sports journalism to the business of making sports fans horny.
What started as a way for bored SI editors to amuse themselves during the slow period of the sports calendar soon grew into an annual event capable of subsidizing much of the rest of the magazine. When sports bloggers eventually rose to power in the 2000s and early 2010s, they internalized the lessons of the swimsuit issue, and ate into SI’s subscription and advertising revenue. In their heyday, these bloggers’ randy posts about WAGs, cheerleaders, and random college students were given prominent placement on popular sports sites.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the tenets of being a Miami Marlins fan is that the future will always be presented as the appeal. The Marlins have made it a habit to trade away star after star for prospects who could eventually become stars, only to then be traded away for more prospects. Logic and reason would lead the team's fans to develop commitment issues, and in turn perhaps shy away from any promising young player, knowing that his time with the Marlins begins to come to an end the second he starts pitching well, or hitting like a machine.
Fortunately, "logic" and "reason" rarely exist in sports fandom, which is why I believe Agustín Ramírez will slug 1.000 and live forever. The 23-year-old catcher came to South Florida as another star left the Marlins: He was one of the New York Yankees' prospects in the trade for Jazz Chisholm Jr. last July. After a solid second half of the season with the delightfully named Triple-A affiliate Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp, and a brief stint at the same club to start this year, Ramírez was called up on Monday as the Marlins began a three-game series against the Cincinnati Reds. After only two games, Ramírez has already found himself in the franchise's record books, and he's become the new promising young player to enjoy for an indeterminate amount of time. Given that he's only on the roster due to injuries to catchers Nick Fortes and Rob Brantly, Ramírez's monster debut is found money for a team that currently has few options behind the plate.]]></summary>
