Midway through the event, Robinson began reaching, after every hurdle, to adjust himself in a way familiar to any penis-haver. Surely even a top track athlete would not be able to win a race, let alone in a season-best 48.05 seconds, with his dong flapping around. Going balls out usually does not lend itself to going balls out.
Some research was needed. Track's not a huge deal here in the States, and the only video existed as a livestream on a subscription service. So we turn to the Swedes, who you'd expect to be all over a penis if one presented itself in Lane 3. From national sport newspaper Sportbladet:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in January, an arbitration case between the NFL and the NFL Players' Association came to a quiet end. The case was initiated by a grievance filed by the NFLPA in 2022, which argued that NFL owners had colluded with each other to deny players fully guaranteed contracts. The arbitrator's final ruling, that the league's owners had not engaged in collusion, was public, but the details of his ruling were not. The arbitrator's full report was published today by Meadowlark Media's Pablo Torre, and it reveals how the NFL's corporate structure makes it possible for owners to openly discuss collusion without technically breaking any rules.
The full ruling, which Torre covers at length in his latest podcast episode, is primarily concerned with a March 2022 meeting between NFL owners and the NFL Management Council (NFLMC). This meeting occurred just a few weeks after Deshaun Watson signed an unprecedented five-year, $230 million contract with the Cleveland Browns that was fully guaranteed. The NFLPA argued that during this meeting the owners conspired to ensure that Watson's contract would be the last of its kind, and that evidence of this conspiracy can be found in part by the fact that quarterbacks Lamar Jackson, Kyler Murray, and Russell Wilson were not offered fully guaranteed deals upon entering free agency after Watson's deal was signed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the hours before Game 7 of the NBA Finals on Sunday, ESPN desk analyst Kendrick Perkins fielded a contrived gambling question about whether or not Chet Holmgren would score 15 points. His reasoning was that Holmgren would, since the Oklahoma City Thunder big had expressed frustration with his previous performance. Or anyway, that's all the reasoning Perkins could fit in before Stephen A. Smith cut him off to scream about how his co-host was annoying him, because things are different in the NBA Finals. Right before the segment mercifully cut to commercial, Bob Myers mounted a defense of Perkins that wound up being a scathing indictment of the whole operation. "Just because you yell something, doesn't mean it's true," he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Las Vegas Aces are bad. Not “bad by their championship standards"—just kind of bad. Two years ago, they lost six games total. In less than a quarter of this season, they have lost seven. By the grace of the incredibly forgiving WNBA playoff system, they are, with a 6-7 record, the last team in. So it was actually kind of heartening to see them gut out a win at home on Sunday afternoon, rallying in the fourth quarter to beat the Indiana Fever and avoid their first four-game losing streak since 2018. Ahead of what could be some morale-boosting games against Connecticut and Washington this week, here was proof that the Aces can still lock in. 
It was not looking that way at halftime this weekend, after what might have been A’ja Wilson’s worst half of professional basketball. Missed layups, contested pull-ups and battles with Aliyah Boston had kept her to 2-of-12 shooting. “I just want to apologize to everybody that was watching. That was not a normal A’ja Wilson night,” she said in the postgame interview on ESPN. Spinning to the cup and timing up big blocks on the defensive end, she had already played the second half like an apology. At the end of the night, Wilson's line was a sightlier 8-of-21, but she apologized again for good measure. “Sorry if you had to see that, but we got the dub.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In July of 2022, Joyce Carol Oates tweeted that her literary agent friend told her editors are no longer interested in reading first novels by young white male writers, “no matter how good.” She was saying this in support of an article by former New York Times columnist Pamela Paul, who argued that the publishing industry is being destroyed by “illiberal scolds” keen to stifle free speech. Among Paul’s examples are the industry’s recourse to sensitivity readers, who ostensibly scold authors, and the backlash against 2020 bestseller American Dirt on the grounds that its white author Jeanine Cummins was not the right person to tell the story of poor Mexican migrants. Paul is implying, in other words, that calls for publishing to address its whiteness problem amount to a form of woke censorship. In sharing Paul’s piece and adding her own anecdote about young white men being overlooked, Oates was connecting their fate to Paul’s complaint: White men are the victims of the industry’s takeover by the DEI mafia.
The idea that white male writers today face diminishing opportunities has since occasioned considerable debate and several attempts to lay out in greater detail the forces behind their recent marginalization. Jacob Savage’s explanation is that they are “vanishing” because, having been castigated as toxic masculinists and told there are no “Good White Men,” they no longer feel that they are allowed to have a voice. Tim Lott argues that an industry now dominated by women editors and agents, who are naturally biased toward manuscripts that center their own experiences, is guilty of the same inequality that women once complained about, except now it is men who are excluded.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The base, corrupting, disenchanting influence of money has allegedly been right on the cusp of ruining everything good, noble, and just plain fun about soccer for almost a century and a half now. An easy year to point to here would be 1885, when England FA's settled the roaring debate about amateurism by allowing soccer players to be paid to play. So much of the game's history since then—the development of the great clubs, the existence of the great leagues and tournaments, the emergence and movement of the great players—has been determined first and foremost by the pursuit of the almighty dollar. Rather than a point of departure, the current, baldly avaricious version of the Club World Cup is but the latest instantiation of trends that have dominated soccer for forever.
Clearly, soccer has not yet been ruined. In spite of everything—the widening gap between teams at the tippity top and those below, clubs getting coopted as money- and reputation-laundering fronts, the steady distancing between clubs and their local fan bases, globalization's concentration of talent and homogenization of the once richly diverse panoply of styles and strategies, overloaded schedules and overburdened players—the game still produces amazing games, amazing players, and amazing competitions, thrilling its enormous, rapt audience with incredible stories. It's not that the money-mindedness has actually been a good thing, nor that all those who've complained about it since 1885 were necessarily wrong. Rather, it's that even in inauspicious conditions, after decisions that seem to fly directly in the face of what has made soccer what it is, the game itself and the people who care about it usually endure.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In January 2024, Semafor media reporter Max Tani published a small scoop: Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman and writer Buzz Bissinger (most famous for authoring Friday Night Lights) were working together on Fetterman’s memoir, which was to be titled Unfettered and focus on his “political rise and struggles with mental health.”
Much has changed since then. Fetterman’s warmongering—he just proudly endorsed President Trump’s psychotic decision to bomb Iran—is one of many reasons his popularity has nosedived among Democratic voters over the last year-and-a-half. He's isolated himself from fellow senators and hemorrhaged staffers, many of whom have departed from his office and then spoken to the press, both on the record and anonymously, about his reportedly erratic behavior and his obsession with supporting Israel’s genocide against the people of Gaza. A New York magazine investigation published in May assigned a much darker definition of “unfettered”: a senator who cannot be reasoned with, who suffers from an addiction to social media, who texts and Facetimes while driving, and is plainly unfit for office.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was convinced it was happening again. 
With 7:41 left in Sunday night's NBA Finals Game 7, the Oklahoma City Thunder took a 22-point lead, a lead that would have felt insurmountable against any other team in the league. But there is no other team in the league like the Indiana Pacers, and they took control, pressuring the inbounds pass, springing double- and triple-teams at ball-handlers, and letting Bennedict Mathurin bash his way into the lane. OKC wobbled and the lead tumbled to 12 in three short minutes. The Thunder, playing prevent offense, did not make another basket for the remainder of the game. The pressure forced Shai Gilgeous-Alexander into committing his fifth foul, and Alex Caruso into calling the team's final timeout with over four minutes left. You could feel the arena hold its collective breath. How fitting it would have been, for a postseason defined more by the Pacers doing the impossible than by anything else, for them to win Game 7 on the road by turning on the blender.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a lot of things we deserve as people. A rational world in which killing civilians for amusement is not an acceptable instrument of foreign policy, as just one farfetched example. But for sports fans, "deserve" is one of those verbs that works way too hard for its weight class, an advert for entitlement based on the notion that the next thing you see must by definition be more spectacular than the last thing you saw. Five-year-olds spit on your shoes in revulsion.
Because, and this will surely surprise all of you who have ever used the phrase "in my lifetime" as a useful metric for any athletic achievement, "deserve" isn't a word that means anything around here. You get what you get, the way you get it, and there's no refund for dissatisfaction unless you decide to get off your collective hinder and stop watching, attending, and paying. Until that moment, well, the polite way to put it is "You bought it, so eat it. And on your way out, settle up your bill."]]></summary>

Neither Mike Breen nor Doris Burke seized the opportunity to club Jefferson over the head with a folding chair, which was a shame, but there followed five seconds of awkward silence. Indiana's deficit was, at that moment, 14 points, and the clock showed 5:38. The Oklahoma City home crowd was chanting "O-K-C" at ear-splitting decibels, but the mood was not yet celebratory. The Pacers were mounting a 9–1 run, fueled by free-throws at one end and grinding, ineffective isolation ball at the other.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A week before I was hired at Defector, I decided to quit vaping. This was kind of a while ago now, but I still have good days and bad. Today is a good day; I haven't even needed a patch today. Yesterday was a rough one. On rough days, I will go buy one single shitty poverty cigar—the brainchild of the Phillies' owner's dad, the Black & Mild wood tip. This is a multi-pronged strategy: I love wood tips, but I rarely smoke a whole one in a sitting, no matter how hard up I might be. Also, everyone around you will think less of you if you do this. A key feature of cravings is self-loathing, and it sort of feels deserved that people will see me: a questionably dressed yet ostensibly grown woman smoking a cigar that is usually purchased with coins. Weakness ought to feel like weakness.
Last night, I had already smoked through my cigar of the day. Since my trip to New York, I'm staying with my aunt and uncle in La Crosse, Wis. for a little while before I drive the rest of the way back from to Tacoma. As the evening pushed forward, I was putting on an impressively brave face for them. Across the river in Winona, a thunderstorm had rolled in, lighting up the sky brilliantly, and the air was so thick you had a real sense for what was clapping back together when the lightning left its jagged vacuums. My aunt and uncle are big nerds (complimentary) about weather. They have a little plane and are spending their retirement bouncing around America with only Mother Nature to play defense. I'm a curious sort, so I leaned into that, hanging on every word they spoke. I begged them to explain more about how the wind played tricks on a small aircraft. I was desperate for distraction from the withdrawal. But after a while they got tired and turned in for the night. I couldn't take my car to satisfy my craving, because that would involve noisily opening the garage, which would be an embarrassing reveal of me making a whole trip to collect a second John Middleton product in just one Thursday. So I would go on foot.]]></summary>

Washington City Paper reported earlier this week that, after this weekend, the Post will no longer have a standalone Metro section in its print edition. The paper told subscribers about the move in an email from executive editor Matt Murray. From City Paper’s story:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the first time in American sports history, a team has been sold on an 11-figure valuation. News broke Wednesday that the Buss family has agreed to sell a controlling share of Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter of TWG Global and Guggenheim Partners in a deal valuing the franchise at $10 billion. That is the largest-ever valuation at sale for a North American sports franchise, smashing the high-water mark recently set by the private equity guy who agreed to buy the Boston Celtics for $6.1 billion. Walter taking over and doing so at such a steep price is obviously interesting, though the bigger story is the Buss family finally cashing out, as they were the flag-bearers for a type of sports owner that is quickly being bought out of the business.
Jerry Buss bought the Lakers, the NHL's Kings, and the Los Angeles Forum in 1979 for $67.5 million. At the time, that sale price was a record high for a team, and though sports teams are the sort of asset that always appreciate in value, few would have predicted that the valuation of the team would increase by 15,000 percent over the following 46 years. In that time period, the collective identity of NBA ownership steadily changed. The used car dealer who owned the Utah Jazz sold the team, through his widow, to a tech billionaire. The NBA forced racist slumlord Donald Sterling to sell the Los Angeles Clippers to one of the richest men in the country. The Maloof brothers, inheritors of beer distribution riches, ran out of money and sold the Sacramento Kings to another much richer tech guy. Most of the people who own teams now are billionaires, and 20 percent of the league is now owned by people who made their billions in private equity.]]></summary>

This dream confluence would give me a chance to watch reigning Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal, always a delight, and my first in-person look at Pirates ace Paul Skenes. Skenes had pitched in Detroit last year—also in the second game of a doubleheader that began with a Skubal start—but I’d missed it because I was in New York at company meetings for my (dumb) job and only caught a few minutes when Jasper gave us breaks from looking at his impressive charts.
Some fans complained that the two aces would not start in the same game on Thursday, though as someone with plans to attend both, this didn’t especially bother me. What did annoy me was it being a split doubleheader: I’d have to buy separate tickets, and leave and come back. A small price to pay, I reasoned, for what was sure to be the greatest day of my baseball-watching life. Around 12:30, the Tigers announced that the 1:10 first game would begin in a rain delay. A slightly larger but still small price to pay, I reasoned, for what was sure to be the greatest day of my baseball-watching life. I waited out the delay at home, enjoying the broadcast’s interstitial highlight reel of new Pirates manager and former Tiger Don Kelly.]]></summary>

Each day seems to bring some new horror or tragedy, and if the non-stop procession of bad news itself doesn't desensitize you, there's all those hucksters out there trying to sell you the idea that, actually, your empathy is wrong. It's enough to make you want to check out of everything altogether.
And plenty of people have. One of the worst byproducts of Trump's second electoral victory was a refrain I heard a lot, usually from other black people: this concept of "resting." The idea starts with the fact that, going back at least to the civil rights movement, black people have spent so much time fighting for our humanity and our communal betterment, only to watch the white-supremacist power structure repeatedly thwart any possibility of radical, positive change. And so, if white people and those who hope to sidle up to white supremacy are so determined to hold onto power, even if it means destroying themselves in the process, then we should let them. Our time now is the time to disengage from the political carousal and do what was best for ourselves. Black self-care as a political ideology unto itself.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Thursday night the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres, who do not like each other, completed a four-game series in which eight batters were hit by pitches. Even excluding the incidents in the previous three-game series the two teams played earlier this month, that's a lot of hit by pitches! Enough, in fact, to rank.
We are innovating in philosophical space here, raising and answering questions such as, Is it possible for a hit-by-pitch to be better quality than another hit by pitch?, and, If so, what makes a hit-by-pitch good? A hit-by-pitch is most meaningful if it is intentional, because otherwise that's just poor control, and poor control is ass to watch. Though intentionality is difficult to presume, pitches with more movement and pitchers with poor control are naturally discounted. A hit-by-pitch is also most meaningful if it carries more risk of hurting your own team—say, hitting a player who doesn't usually get on base, doing it in a close game or on an advantageous count, or doing it with hitters already on base. That is, the best hit-by-pitches are fueled by enough petty spite that they break out of the constrictive traditional frameworks of "trying to win a baseball game."]]></summary>

I stumbled into this paradigm in March of 2023, when Nora was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at the age of 2. Nora is 4 now—a fiery, intelligent young lady who leads her classmates in preschool group activities and directs mommy to the car whenever they are lost in the parking lot—but she still doesn’t speak. On a short enough timeline, that’s perfectly fine; we don’t need to speak to enjoy an hour at the park or share an ice cream cone. Nora is happy. She is healthy. Everything is all right.
Still, being a parent is a worrying thing, and there are fears that never really go away. What if she never speaks? What if she can’t take care of herself after my wife and I are gone? Lately, this fear has assumed a distressingly hued human form, one frequently seen getting upset in front of Congress and making rounds on the cable news circuit. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will talk to, or at, anyone; like many of the content creators Donald Trump has appointed in his second term, he seems to understand that to be his job. But when it comes to autism, it feels as if he is speaking directly to me.]]></summary>

Before last Saturday's game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants at Dodger Stadium, the singer Nezza performed "The Star-Spangled Banner" in Spanish, even after being told not to by team representatives, in a symbolic protest against the jackbooted deportation raids being carried out around the country and in Los Angeles by faceless federal goons. It is the sort of cruelty that no human being can help but take sides on, but a baseball team is not a human being, and the Dodgers had pointedly declined to offer any comment on the crisis to that point, even as Angelenos' protests in the streets were repeatedly escalated to violence by heavy-handed policing.
"We're not going to comment," Dodgers executive vice president and chief marketing officer Lon Rosen said that same day. That was in response to questions from the Los Angeles Times about whether the team had anything to say to its fans, a community that the organization proudly boasts is 40 percent Latino, and therefore a disproportionate target of ICE raids. "We’re not going to comment on anything."]]></summary>

The 20-point lead, once the gold standard, is now 30, and even then there's a little white-knuckling to be done. But like any absolute counterfactual, sometimes the percentages get in the way. In fact, in every case of a team getting a 30-point lead, it was once a 20-point lead. Sometimes an ass-kicking is just an ass-kicking.
Enter Game 7 of the NBA Finals, coming Sunday night to a television near you. The Pacers, who have gained their ultra-plucky reputation as the team that lets the other guy get the 20-point lead before eradicating it, finally went nearly wire-to-wire (minus the first three-and-a-half minutes) in a 108–91 beatdown of the Thunder to force El Juego Definitivo.]]></summary>

So far, so relatable. But! Your co-host is out of town, and also if it was just you and Megan there's a chance the podcast would be like 40 minutes of questions about Jed Lowrie and Brett Anderson and 20 minutes of answers amounting to "will you please stop asking me about Brett Anderson."

The administration enlisted Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to carry out unprecedented waves of widespread firings, buyouts, and reductions in force, many of which faced legal challenges. As of June 6, the labor department has reported the federal government has gotten rid of 59,000 jobs since January. These firings are deeply political. They intend to purge nonpartisan employees and replace them with loyalists.
This series puts names and faces to some of the thousands of civil servants whose lives and futures have been upended. They all share a commitment to public service and a belief that the government is supposed to help people.]]></summary>

The final day of the group play stage of the league’s in-season Commissioner’s Cup tournament involved six games in one night, the first five overlapping. On account of the odd number of WNBA teams right now, Copper’s Phoenix Mercury were the lucky 13th team out. They could simply kick up their feet and take in one of the more colorful nights the league has seen. What was her "Wow" about? We can only guess. These were my own Wows from each game:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some good news: The New York Yankees have now been shut out for three games in a row. This is in spite of mitigating factors such as facing the "Los Angeles" Angels of Anaheim and being newly Giancarlo Stanton'd up. Take a 2–0 loss to the Boston Red Sox, a 1–0 loss in 11 innings in the ghost runner era, and a 4–0 loss to Kyle Hendricks's 86 mile-per-hour fastball, et voilà: The Yankees are now the third team this year to achieve this storied feat, joining the Cincinnati Reds and the Colorado Rockies. That's company you want to be keeping.
Unlike the Reds and the Rockies, who accomplished the feat through the tried and true strategy of not getting on base, the Yankees have gone the much more convoluted route of getting runners on base and stranding them there. They have left as many runners on base as the Reds and Rockies had combined during their respective streaks. In their 11-inning shutout loss, the Yankees had the bases loaded and Hunter Strickland on the mound. Anthony Volpe grounded out to end the game. A classic mishap of putting in more effort to get the exact same results: zero runs, zero wins. In some ways, you have to respect it.]]></summary>

Just as predictable is the kind of books that will appear on these lists. These books are recent, they are already well-publicized, and they are generally described as suited to one particular location (the beach). But summer, and summer reading, is capacious. It's more than the feeling of being on vacation and more than the books you might buy at the airport. This is why we decided to give you a different kind of summer reading guide.
Our list is full of books that we genuinely endorse that are not all super new or super popular. We tried to pick books that went with summer's various and specific moods, or that we might not have a good excuse to recommend otherwise.

Some of this funk can be explained by the U.S. team getting embarrassed on the field. Until they hung five goals on poor Trinidad and Tobago over the weekend, the USMNT had lost four straight games by an aggregate score of 9-2. Two of those were competitive games against CONCACAF rivals and two were friendly losses to legit European teams, though there's little point in drawing a distinction between the pairs of matches, because the stakes in both were the same: nothing. Losing is one thing. The larger and thornier issue is that if the team were winning, all they could win would be a reprieve from people paying attention to the program's structural bustedness.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["You can't be a serious critic," New York Times technology reporter Kevin Roose wrote on Tuesday, on Bluesky, about artificial intelligence, "if you're in denial about how useful it is." Narrowly, in strict terms, this is true: You can't be a serious critic of anything if you are in denial about any part of it, where "in denial" describes an irrational and unfounded rejection of empirical reality. That's hardly even worth saying, but it's also not really what Roose is saying.
What Roose wants is to put an entire suite of claims about the technology presently doing business as "artificial intelligence"—not just that it has more than zero uses (a thing nobody really denies) but that it truly is artificial intelligence or anything like it; that it represents a profound leap forward for technology and human endeavor; that it is the future; that, as such, adopting it and integrating it into day-to-day work and life processes is the smart move—beyond dispute. He wants to marginalize the many technology experts, media knowers, and sharp lay readers who have for years been calling his work on behalf of those claims appalling boobery. He wants his readers to view all of those critics as coterminous with whatever minor body of irrelevant five-follower internet loons might bother trying to argue the literal uselessness of a predictive text generator or a program that collates search engine results into layperson's language. He wants his readers to think of all the critics as united in an essentially pathological relationship with the observable world. And he wants the juice of dancing this shitty little passive-aggressive jig on Bluesky, the social-media platform where many of those critics will encounter his work and, while dunking on it, also share it around to some number of people who will read it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are some things you can learn about fascism before you actually learn them during fascism, and there are others that you can only learn through experience. The fundamental instability of fascist political formations is one of those. The stupid and scattershot brutality of every moment, the relentless and obvious lying and the variously shameful ways in which institutions quail or qualify or quit in the face of it, the regular paroxysms of political violence and self-harm, the freakish and orgiastic backstabbing and self-dealing and perversity of a depraved new ruling class—all of this is real, but day by day they are experienced less as identifiable attributes of fascism and more as the dumb daily fact of it.
Both in the literature and in the moment, that stupid and strident chaos is the natural result of the scammers and degenerates and opportunists that populate those regimes doing the things they do, and of the desperate and deluded political moments and populaces that tend to produce fascism, and of the self-annihilating grandiosity of the gold-plated godheads that squat atop it all, trying to freeze that churn into permanence through the application of state violence and sheer idiot will. It is all jarring and idiotic and miserable, and as it fails around you there really isn't much comfort in the knowledge that it Actually Doesn't Work. In the long run, it absolutely doesn't, but the people in charge do not believe in the long run; the work of their project is to freeze the present in place, and to defy whatever reckoning tomorrow might bring. Everyone else is trapped in that unending day with them, a place where bad things are always happening but nothing ever resolves. Reading about fascism will tell you about how it begins and how it works and even how it tends to end, but it can only tell you so much about how it feels.]]></summary>

The 1938–40 Toronto Maple Leafs managed it when the National Hockey League was only seven or eight teams deep and all you had to do to compete was not go bankrupt, and the 1968–70 St. Louis Blues got swept three consecutive times as an expansion team when one of the two divisions was all expansion teams.
Thus, it is hard to conceive of the Edmonton Oilers as they are this morning, first beaten and then hammered by the Florida Panthers in successive years, not having to live with this feeling for years to come. Knowing that the other guy is better one year is hard to endure, but knowing that the same guy got almost incalculably better a year later makes this a more existential defeat.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Panthers are the reason your favorite team stinks. Not because they've ruined all those other teams' records, though they have, but because Florida has successfully built what every front office in a copycat league has and will continue to ineffectively flail toward. Everyone holds up "toughness" as the ideal form of playoff hockey. They want to get "tougher." Meaner. More physical. They ignore the part, or take shortcuts around it because it's difficult to achieve, where Florida's toughness is merely a flavor of its skill. The Panthers are good. They score goals and they wear down defenses and generally make life difficult for opposing skaters because they finish their checks and protect their guys and drive you slobberingly insane with rage because they know where the line is, and play comfortably just on either side of it. 
Your favorite team, in search of toughness to help get over a playoff hump, will do things like—say—sign Ryan Reaves for three years. The Panthers, on the other hand, will do things like trade for Matthew Tkachuk and let him define their whole identity, or acquire Sam Bennett for a song and watch him win the Conn Smythe, or get Brad Marchand (poster boy for "good enough that he doesn't need to do the extracurriculars, but better for having them in his bag") at the deadline.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Club World Cup kicked off over the weekend in the United States, and it's been a wild ride so far, in the most derogatory way possible. It's not so much about the games themselves, which have been mostly either stodgy goalless draws or one-sided beat-downs (thanks for coming, Auckland City, enjoy your 10-0 defeat to Bayern Munich!) in front of small, generally disinterested crowds (who could've imagined that a Monday afternoon match between Chelsea and LAFC in Atlanta wouldn't exactly pack the stadium?). Instead, the real action for this rebranded and expanded version of the tournament has come off the pitch, as the tournament kicks off amidst nationwide protests and Donald Trump's quest to be the most special dictator he can be. Luckily for Trump, he has FIFA bending the knee left and right.
The concept of the Club World Cup itself may be exciting on paper—never-before-seen matchups! true global representation! concrete proof that MLS does indeed suck!—but all of its ostensibly commendable aims are undermined by the core truth that this tournament exists solely to make FIFA lots of money, player welfare, fan interest, and competitive integrity be damned. That core truth is why the newfangled tournament never seemed all that compelling for those of us who don't stand to make millions from either producing or participating in it; the Trumpy specifics of this particular edition—all the reports about ICE and Customs and Border Protection showing up to games, as well as requests that everyone attending bring proof of citizenship, residency, or their visas—soured an already sour proposition.]]></summary>

In moving four certified mammals to the Boston Red Sox for designated hitter and apparent pain in the ass Rafael Devers, the Giants finally achieved the big get they hadn't managed since they outbid themselves by $40 million for Barry Zito in 2006. That one was an analytic misstep, unless you count Zito’s two postseason starts in 2012, in which he won Game 5 of the NL Championship Series (with the Giants down 3-1 to the St. Louis Cardinals) and then Game 1 of the World Series. Those two starts made the deal a barg . . . well, okay, not a bargain. But at least some value for the money. Also he could play guitar.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At some point this season, Shohei Ohtani pitching and hitting will once again become ordinary, and only when he does something truly extraordinary will it be worth writing about. We are not yet at that point in the season. The Ohtani coverage will continue until the pitch count improves. It speaks to the absurd density of what has changed about Shohei Ohtani that this is the situation of his first start in nearly two years: He threw his first 28 pitches in a Dodgers uniform on the same day that his former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, reported to federal prison.
I would like to hype up the outing with more than that. Ohtani's return to the mound is not a novelty, as some might have feared after he left the Los Angeles Angels—for any criticism allotted to the Angels, you have to admit that they were in a position to let Ohtani do whatever he wanted. As previously noted, the Dodgers desperately need starting pitching. And so they had to take the option of a glorified rehab start, considering the minor league dilemma: As pitcher Ohtani and hitter Ohtani are the same person (allegedly; I have only seen one of him at any given time), his rehab start necessarily had to take place against the San Diego Padres as opposed to, say, the Round Rock Express. It was arguably overshadowed by Dylan Cease hitting Andy Pages with a fastball, and Padres manager Mike Shildt shouting, "Who the fuck do you think you are?" after Pages expressed some displeasure at taking 98 miles-per-hour to the arm. In otherwise, average Dodgers–Padres June game shenanigans.]]></summary>

But I mean it in the most literal sense possible. Kris Knoblauch presumably knows by this point who it will be, but if anyone tells you they know who's the better option, they're lying. Nobody knows!
While the Panthers have made it to within a game of clinching their second straight Cup on the back of Sergei Bobrovsky and only Sergei Bobrovsky, the Oilers got through the past two months with a chaotic combo in net. They began with their primary starter, Stuart Skinner. The 26-year-old looked like the answer to their crease problem when he first slotted into the role a couple of years ago, but has only declined from there. Skinner almost handed the team an early exit, looking absolutely helpless in his first couple games against the Kings. He was replaced by the 33-year-old Pickard, a fringe NHLer whose only season as a starter saw him lead the league in losses for Colorado in 2017. Inexplicably, Pickard won four straight for the Oilers to get the series win, and even though a couple of those games were 7-4 and 6-4, Edmonton was in no position to complain.]]></summary>

As soon as she took the microphone, a few people on the back side of the little pavilion at the center of Mullinix Park began heckling her; at first, a whole crowd away and out of sight from the hecklers, I thought they were pro–Donald Trump counterprotesters, but I made my way over there and found that they were actually anti-Trump protesters, perhaps the anti-Trump-iest people there, and were mad specifically at the congressperson.
When McClain Delaney spoke of the need to stand up to the Trump administration's terrorism of immigrant communities, one of the hecklers shouted "Then don't thank ICE!" This seemed like it was probably a reference to her vote in favor of a congressional resolution expressing "gratitude to law enforcement officers, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel, for protecting the homeland." I didn't get a chance to ask any of them, but I'd wager they were also unhappy with McClain Delaney's vote for the Laken Riley Act calling on ICE to detain and deport immigrants arrested for—but not convicted of or even charged with—nonviolent offenses. Or her vote for a Republican-sponsored bill overturning the city of Washington, D.C.'s immigration laws and forcing its officials to cooperate with DHS and ICE.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A romantic comedy often opens with a scene where the protagonist demonstrates that she's not like other girls. In Legally Blonde, that's Reese Witherspoon slipping her freshly painted toenails into wedge heels with a heart on them, before she heads out to the date that will ruin all her plans. In Pride & Prejudice (2005), that's Keira Knightley reading while she walks outside, and returning home to her chaotic family. In Materialists—the new Celine Song movie released over the weekend—Dakota Johnson applies lip gloss in a mirror and runs out onto the New York City streets, her high ponytail swinging. She passes a tall man, stops him, and offers him her card. She's a matchmaker named Lucy, and he's tall and rich and would be great for her clients.
But that's not the first scene in Materialists. The movie opens with a vast red-rocked canyon filling the screen. It is beautiful and immense. Then we watch a long-haired prehistoric man chop a bushel of daisies, put it into a backpack, and carry it to a cave where a woman waits for him. They do not speak. The man then twists the stem of one of the daisies into a ring and slips it onto the cave woman's left ring finger. Get it? It's not a diamond. It's just a flower. That's love, baby.]]></summary>

The Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, host site of the Canadian Grand Prix, encircles an island in Montreal. It is a gorgeous circuit, featuring the close-hewn walls of a street race, a run through lush greenery rivaling even the aesthetics of the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, and marmots. Groundhogs, specifically, who have found a circuit raised upon their homes and stayed put, to infrequent risk of extreme bodily harm, i.e. decapitation or bisection.
On turn 13, Lewis Hamilton hit a groundhog that was on track with his Ferrari. The remainder of the groundhog stayed as debris on the track, shown a few times throughout the race. Hamilton was smartly not informed of this fact during the race, which, thanks to resulting floor damage and poor pit-stop timing, he spent largely treading water on an island in P6. The nature of automobiles leads to somewhat flippant and/or nervously hysterical reactions to loss of animal life—during the weekend's running of 24 Hours of Le Mans, the delirious night session commentators' processing of a local rabbit death included a (unobserved?) moment of silence and the term "derabbitized"—but the vegan Hamilton was naturally upset after the race. There may be a crude metaphor in there for how things are going at Ferrari this year, though it remains to be seen who exactly is the groundhog.]]></summary>

Battling relentless rain that essentially gave Sunday's action an extended halftime break, contending players like Adam Scott and Sam Burns sunk themselves with final-round scores of 78 and 79 respectively, as a course saturated with water worked to make their lies as miserable as possible. To put golfers in these conditions is like trying to make Sabrina Ionescu shoot threes in a wind tunnel, or Harry Kane take a penalty with a ball made of lead. It stops being about "Who's the best?" and starts being about "Who can survive?"

The win made for a sweep of their division rivals and put the Red Sox half a game back of a wild card spot. A middling rotation haunted Boston for much of the season and especially in early June, but now they’d won on the strength of their pitching, which held Yankees bats to four total runs all weekend. 
At the start of the week, Roman Anthony, the top prospect in baseball, joined Kristian Campbell and Marcelo Mayer in the big leagues to complete the arrival of the team’s long-awaited ‘Big Three’ prospect trio. If these young, promising lads weren’t exactly contributing “hits” as they adjusted to MLB pitching, they still kept the vibes all nice and hopeful. It doesn't get much better than this, some fathers and their children celebrating at Fenway may have thought, as they watched Rafael Devers clobber an insurance solo homer onto the ledge of the Green Monster.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a defensible reading of Game 4 of the NBA Finals as an aesthetic disappointment, a slugfest of a game defined by Bennedict Mathurin missing a bunch of free throws in the final minute and the Oklahoma City Thunder shooting a collective 3-for-16 from three-point range and recording a collective 11 assists, both season lows. Certainly, if you wanted to read the game through the lens of individual offensive brilliance, you'd find the text lacking, though to do so would be to voluntarily step back from the bleeding edge of basketball. Game 4 was not only the best game of what has been a great series, but a klaxon from the future, the highest-level example of the sort of collective, pure-pressure hoops that's been the story of this season.
The ghastly 3-for-16 figure is an instructive place to start, as it is an extremely aberrant statistic. What it shows is not so much a Thunder offense that played poorly, but a Pacers defense that strung together a near-perfect night of defense. The most thoughtfully articulated concerns about the ubiquity of the three-pointer in modern NBA basketball arrive at the point that the three makes NBA offense fundamentally unstoppable, the spatial advantages of parking a bunch of guys on the perimeter rendering the game into a mere shooting contest. The defense played by both the Pacers and the Thunder makes a mockery of that assertion, as both units managed to shut down the opponents' long-range shooting without surrendering open looks at the rim.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first big trade of the NBA offseason arrived yesterday, and it was one that no one saw coming: Memphis Grizzlies shooting guard Desmond Bane has been shipped off to the Orlando Magic in exchange for Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Cole Anthony, and four unprotected first-round picks.
Four first-round picks for a guy who as never made an all-star tea—shhhhh. I am going to keep my index finger pressed to your lips until you finish hearing what I have to say: Yes, a bushel of first-round picks is the kind of thing you expect to see included in a trade package for a real-deal superstar, which Bane is not. But to call this an overpay by the Magic would be to ignore how deals actually get done in the NBA. Players of a certain status are able to heavily influence and in some cases entirely dictate their own movements in the trade market, meaning that if a team like Orlando wants to hoard a pile of first-round picks until a true franchise savior becomes available to them, they are likely to be sitting on those picks forever. You can only play in the corner of the market that's available to you, and Orlando found a big prize in theirs.]]></summary>
