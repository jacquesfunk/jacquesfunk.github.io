        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JuJu Watkins was everything and the only thing. On Thursday night against No. 1 UCLA, she was the beginning, hitting three threes in the first quarter to send that awful she’s got it tonight feeling through the Bruins’ stomachs. She was the middle, literally all of it. When the sophomore guard found teammate Kennedy Smith alone at the rim in transition to start the fourth quarter, Smith’s layup was USC’s first non-Watkins field goal since the end of the first. And then she was the end. In the fourth quarter, the No. 6 Trojans trailing and gasping for breath, she blocked three shots in the span of a minute and scored two quick baskets to regain the lead her team had lost early in the third.
Not until the two-minute mark of the fourth quarter did any of her teammates finally break double digits. But by that point, there was no mystery left. JuJu Watkins had spoiled the plot: No matter how many times UCLA took control, no matter how many layups her teammates fumbled, no matter how sludgy the offense got, she would not be losing tonight. End of story.]]></summary>

This is the second time the museums have wagered on the Super Bowl; two years ago in April KC’s museum got Thomas Eakins’s 1875 oil painting Sailing from the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It was on display for about two months. While it would be Very Philadelphian to have settled this bet using a Philadelphia artist, the Nelson-Atkins curators were the ones to pick that painting from the PMA’s collection.]]></summary>

Rarer still is the scenario in which such a politician has an Indian wife and kids himself.
Vice President JD Vance found himself in those narrow circumstances earlier this month. Marko Elez, a 25-year-old enlistee at Elon Musk's center for bussin' constitutional violations, had been linked to a Twitter account that posted things like "Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool," and "Normalize Indian hate."

Things generally feel real bad right now, and that has a way of permeating just about everything. It can make posting a comment on the internet seem even more pointless than normal (which should be impossible), and it can make compiling a list of comments from one website (even our favorite website) seem like a gigantic waste of time.  But you know what, we got into looking through comments, and I found myself forgetting these feelings and laughing instead.]]></summary>

The water wouldn’t actually make it to Los Angeles, and the places in the San Joaquin Valley where it was going are more at risk of flooding right now than of drying out. Even the supposed beneficiaries of the water windfall knew that gorging now meant potentially being dry during the long hot summers when they actually needed the water. 
“A decision to take summer water from local farmers and dump it out of these reservoirs shows a complete lack of understanding of how the system works and sets a very dangerous precedent,” Dan Vink, a longtime Tulare County water manager told SJV Water.]]></summary>

Just how good this Team USA is, heralded as perhaps the best roster the country has ever iced, is still to be determined, even after a 6-1 shellacking of Finland in Montreal on Thursday night that served as both a barometer and a warm-up for Saturday's throwdown with Team Canada.

Super Bowl 59, for all the highlights it generated and the broader satisfaction of its thoroughness, was more or less erasing itself as it happened; by the time it finally lapsed into the Rob Lowe-hosted game show that followed it on FOX, it was pretty much gone and the long sports winter already felt deep and endless. For Defector, this is both a challenge, because there just aren't a lot of sports happening right now, and something of an opportunity to stretch out a little bit, write some anglerfish fiction and jarringly vivid descriptions of bad smells and the like.]]></summary>

They can stretch past 100 feet long and weigh up to 330,000 pounds. Being this big, it seems, should render blue whales impervious to predators. But just as no bank is too big to fail, no whale is too big to totally evade being eaten by the ocean's top predator. Killer whales prey on nearly every large animal species found in the ocean, and blue whales are no exception.
In 2022, scientists confirmed that a pod of orcas can take down an adult blue whale, not to mention the smaller calves they frequently hunt. "Killer whale attacks on large whales is the biggest predation event that occurs on the planet," Robert Pitman, a researcher with the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University, wrote in an email. "There probably hasn’t been anything on that scale since dinosaurs roamed the earth."]]></summary>

According to the metadata, I created it in October 2023, and I'm sure I've opened it at least every couple days since. It would be incoherent to anyone who sneaked a peek, but it's a very useful piece of infrastructure in my life. It's a list of entrees, basically, with sections separated by planned grocery store trips. There are no specific dates attached, but the list is reverse chronological: Whatever I'm going to eat next is at the top, and my future meals proceed from there. At the very bottom are meals I want to make but don't have an assigned spot in the batting order yet.
The document is adjusted and revised often, which is why I don't lock in any meal to a particular day. When I make social plans that involve eating, or would cause me to miss a meal, I do some shuffling. As I write this, though, "food.txt" stretches out eight weeks in advance—pastas, chicken recipes, tacos, even a tentative visit to a bagel shop. It sounds very intense, I know. It's a symptom of an anxious mind that leans heavily on structures and plans. But I'm still kind of proud of how I got here.]]></summary>

Given her own stellar play in that series, and the combined shortcomings of the referees and her backcourt in Game 5, she was right to be. These days, she is no less angry. In an interview with Taylor Rooks in January, prefacing that she might “get beef for saying this,” Collier declared that she would never get over the loss. When Rooks asked her what she meant by “getting beef,” Collier explained, “People just calling me a sore loser. I’m like, I am a sore loser. It sucks! I agree with you. I am very sore about losing.” 
One of the problems the startup basketball league Unrivaled was meant to solve was that WNBA stars’ overseas arrangements kept them out of sight, out of mind for a long time. To brands or corporate sponsors, it was hardly ideal for a potential endorser to spend only half the year stateside. To fans and players, there was something else frustrating about these big offseason gaps. Last impressions are strong, and six months is too much time to keep stewing in them.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost four years after agreeing to buy the Minnesota Timberwolves from Glen Taylor, Alex Rodriguez and Diapers.com tycoon Marc Lore have won an arbitration case that will allow them to finally take control of the team. A three-person arbitration panel issued its ruling on Monday, voting 2-1 to let them advance to the final steps of seeing out a contract they agreed to, which Taylor was trying to wriggle out of. The mechanics of that vote, and the process it guaranteed, are far more arcane than simply and immediately transferring ownership, but the upshot is that Taylor is out and the Business Boys are in. It's the story of NBA ownership over the past two decades in miniature.
Taylor has always been a bad owner. This is not always the simplest thing to judge, as a team's performance in the short and even medium term can exceed the willingness of its ownership group to do the two things that distinguish a "good" owner: pay the luxury tax for a good team and, most importantly, shut up and get out of the way. You can't always get both, and many fans would settle for one or the other. Marc Cuban, former Dallas Mavericks majority owner and now Mavericks minority owner, was never willing to abide by the latter clause, though he regularly paid the tax when his teams were in contention. Memphis Grizzlies owner Robert Pera has learned to keep himself out of the public eye—after Sports Illustrated reported that he wanted then-coach Dave Joerger to wear a headset so Pera could personally call in plays—though he is staunchly unwilling to pay the luxury tax.]]></summary>

Both have reigned over their respective domains—the Premier League and the Champions League—with unprecedented supremacy. Clashes between the two have become annual rituals that determine which one can claim the title of the best team in the world. But while most of the the names and faces of the current City-Madrid tie are familiar from those iconic matches of the recent past, if Tuesday's first leg of their UCL knockout playoff reminded us of anything, it's just how far below their usual standard these teams have been this year, specifically at the back.

This was a neighborhood with Razor scooters dumped in trimmed front lawns. Where family walks with leashed dogs happened down the middle of intentionally curved streets named after long demolished natural landmarks like "Timbercrest" and "Forest Trails." Where the HOA (because of course there was an HOA) banned the installation of driveway basketball hoops.
Receiving industrial freight deliveries, freshly cleared through international customs, probably wasn't explicitly prohibited in the homeowner's handbook. But then, why would it need to be?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Civilization series has been a load-bearing pillar of the video game industry dating back to 1991, and though the series has gone through many changes throughout its history, the core gameplay has generally stayed the same. Players pick a civilization with an attached leader, then guide it from the early stages of humanity into the near future. It's a tried-and-true formula that has had enough wrinkles to not just thrive for 34 years, but also inspire enough passion in its different iterations to have rabid fanatics of each game. (For my money, Civilization V is the best one, even though I played VI the most.) Civilization VII tries something new, something so fundamentally different that at times it feels like a Civ competitor more than a proper new entry in the series. It shouldn't work, and it often doesn't, but the evolution, really the revolution, that comes with the seventh installment of this long-running series is thrilling even in its flaws.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1992, while Octavia E. Butler was writing her novel Parable of the Sower, Los Angeles was hitting bottom. The acquittal of the police officers filmed brutalizing Rodney King triggered a paroxysm of riots and violence in the city. To Butler and many others, it felt like the apotheosis of a number of untenable realities. As a writer of science fiction, Butler took the anxieties she felt—about social rot and political atrophy, about a vision of capitalism poised somewhere between merely dehumanizing and actively anti-human, about climate collapse and social collapse—and turned them into a story that was both more speculative and more full of possibility than the news. Parable of the Sower, which was published in 1993, begins in the year 2024.
The book tells the story of Lauren Oya Olamina, a brilliant and supernaturally sensitive 15-year-old growing up in a town that sits on the outskirts of a collapsing Los Angeles, and in every way on the verge of a deep abyss. Her experience of the dying world around her fuels a vision of a new faith, called Earthseed; when circumstances force Lauren out into that world, she and that faith are tested over and over again as she and a collection of fellow travelers look for safety in a very dangerous country. It's not any more uplifting or much less harrowing than it sounds—I haven't finished reading it yet, but I'm not expecting a big comeback for Society—and the many ways in which it has proved prescient do not make it any easier to take. But it did give the book, which was well-reviewed in its time and became a cornerstone of Butler's legacy, a long and uneasy second life. In the fall of 2020, at what felt like the bottom of the pandemic, 27 years after it was first published, and 14 years after Butler's death, Parable of the Sower became a New York Times bestseller.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid returned from his latest injury-related absence on Feb. 4, and if you were to look at his statistics across the four games he has played this month, you might get the impression that he's right back in the groove. He's averaged 26 points, 10 rebounds, and six assists in those games, and he's gotten to play three of them alongside Tyrese Maxey and Paul George. Embiid's on the floor and the Big Three is finally reaching an operational state; things are finally starting to turn around in Philadelphia, right?
The Sixers are 1-3 since Embiid returned to the lineup (George did not play in the game they won), and each has produced footage of Embiid that one might describe as "alarming." He shot 38 percent from the field in last Friday's loss to the Pistons, and in 30 minutes of action was able to put together a highlight reel of awkward flailing. Last night's game against the Raptors produced what might be a new low point in Embiid's season. Down two with 16 seconds left, Embiid set a screen for Maxey at the top of the three-point line and then popped into space. Maxey zipped the ball to his wide-open big man, who lined up a potential game-winning three, hesitated, awkwardly drove into the defense, and then just kind of ... dribbled the ball off the back of his own head?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was sleepwatching through the first two episodes of Severance. It’s not an easy show to get into. It’s sterile because it’s supposed to be—it’s a show about a biotech company called Lumon whose employees have the option of severing their brains so that one version of them goes to the office (the “innie”), while the other (the “outie”) can just live their life. Neither of them ever has to meet—they do not share a consciousness. It’s a clear indictment of corporate culture and the modern workplace in general, the soulless bullshit jobness of it all, but that can almost make it a little hard to stay with it because it can be alienating. The first season has Mark (Adam Scott) leading his co-workers, including game new hire Helly (Britt Lower), award-driven Dylan (Zach Cherry) and company man Irving (John Turturro) on a mutiny. The second season brings them back, with Lumon clearly attempting a pivot to various superficial perks in order to lull the team back into sedation. And this is where we are in the third episode, with a confused Dylan being led to Lumon’s security room. 
When he arrives, it’s an eerie scene, like all the scenes in the series where some form of real-life attempts to invade the corporate space. A wall of screens shows a disarmingly mall-grade portrait of Dylan and a woman who appears to be his wife. That woman appears to be Merritt Wever, who just might be my favorite actress in the world.]]></summary>

After five weeks, your excitement has probably worn off and you've probably had a share of good and bad days to muddle through. Your Defector pals have just finished their fifth week of The Artist's Way, a 12-week course on creativity created by Julia Cameron, and the novelty has certainly worn off for a lot of us. But that doesn't mean there weren't little breakthroughs along the way. It's tempting to think of something like The Artist's Way as a quick(ish) fix for any and all creative and existential woes, but the kinds of changes many of us are hoping for happen incrementally. The Artist's Way, and these weekly check-ins, are useful ways to stop and notice those incremental changes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When our brilliant, inquisitive colleague Kelsey McKinney last participated in the Defector staff author interview series, she was here as a novelist. Her debut, God Spare The Girls, came out in 2021. In those pages, you can already sense her interest in rumors and secrets, the way they structure our communities. Six months later, she and Alex Sujong Laughlin dropped the first episode of Normal Gossip, the instant mega-hit podcast serving up “juicy, strange, funny, and utterly banal gossip about people you'll never know and never meet.” After seven seasons, Kelsey and Alex have left the show in the hands of an amazing new host-producer duo in Rachelle Hampton and Se'era Spragley Ricks, but Kelsey has distilled all the years she’s spent telling, listening to and thinking about gossip into a new book, You Didn’t Hear This From Me: (Mostly) True Notes On Gossip, which is out today.
“At its most basic, gossip is just one person talking to another about someone who isn’t present,” Kelsey writes. She swallows up all these disparate categories of story—rumor, conspiracy, legend—and cleverly digests them. In some essays, she re-examines familiar places to see how gossip functions—in religious communities, on reality TV sets. In others, she’s concerned with the systems that accelerate gossip, like the norms of the internet and the anatomy of the ear. By the time you finish this book, you will have traveled in so many strange and enriching directions. Take this sampling from the "D" section of the index: defamation; Deuxmoi; Diana, Princess of Wales; Dickinson, Emily; Disney, Walt; Doja Cat; Donegan, Moira; dopamine; Dostoevsky, Fyodor; drag queen terminology.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Los Angeles Dodgers' spectacular and mostly uncontested offseason binge buy has provided for conspiracy theorists just as surely as it has for Dodgers fans. The benefit to the latter, who have seen the defending champs add a two-time Cy Young Award winner and a vaunted international free agent, among many others, is not hard to figure. Conspiracy types, for their part, can look at the Dodgers’ power moves and see the angle that MLB owners will play in their next attempt to finally install a salary cap. Their historic outlay for Shohei Ohtani a year ago made perfect sense because they just won the World Series; that they would continue trying to get better seems, to some, uncouth. In raising their tax payroll by $110 million in two years the Dodgers are now raising suspicions that they are cravenly buying up all the people there are in the game, and ruining baseball, and blah blah blah.
Well, maybe, but what if all this is actually a move toward legitimizing the Dodgers' recent history? Even allowing for their dominance in the marketplace and their roll to victory in October, the Dodgers have not yet won a championship 1) in a complete season (they won the 2020 bubble title), or 2) while wearing actual major league uniforms since 1988.]]></summary>
