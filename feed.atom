        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[However you measure the longterm efficacy of the NBA's in-season tournament (we recommend this is as a helpful road sign), last night's mass homage to Gilligan's Island in San Francisco is what this event was always meant to be—an entertaining outlier on the all-important road to a trophy with no apparent value. That it was buried in the late window on a Tuesday night is one of those puzzling decisions that makes a person wonder if the NBA wants the tournament to matter to its bill-paying viewers in the way it hopes the tournament will someday matter to players.
There was no way to make this one not matter, though. Warriors-Mavericks was its own electronic billboard, a sure spike in the regular season drone no matter when it was played. Stephen Curry is one of the two pillars of the league's ratings renaissance alongside King James I, and his brilliance has powered the league's last two media rights contracts; Klay Thompson was Curry's left ventricle on a series of near-magical teams that dominated much of the last decade. On Tuesday, they played against each other for the first time since Thompson chose expat status in Dallas with a team that, on paper, seemed to offer a better chance to get him a mood-altering fifth ring than the seemingly aging-out Warriors.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I spent the first year of the pandemic picking my battles. My partner and I tried many new things together: cooking pierogies, shaving our arms, playing the ukelele, getting so high you get lost in your own tinnitus, buying too many house plants, Animal Crossing. In one way, we succeeded in doing all these things, because we did do them and time did pass. In another way, failure was a universal constant. When that happens, it is probably not helpful to tell someone that you will scream if you have to hear "Hallelujah" on the ukelele one more time. 
But in the context of a massive crisis where so much is out of your control, what does it mean to be helpful? What is good when the world is upside-down? When the usual compasses stop working, many of us revert to bizarre reflexes and weaponized boredom. And who are we to judge?]]></summary>

During a Monday press conference, Brown revealed that after losses, he is so despondent he does not shower. “I just brush my teeth,” he said. “I don’t deserve soap. I don’t deserve to do all that … winners get washed.” Brown says he can’t sleep in the same bed as his wife because he smells after losses. He finally showered Monday morning.]]></summary>

Navigate them the way you might an overstuffed museum wing: Sidle up to whatever looks interesting, scan the rest, and trust that you can always circle back later to see what you missed. Champions of the women’s game like to talk up that last point. On this side, where the best players stick around for three or four years, star power burns slow.
But if there’s an industry poorly served by this arrangement, it is blogging. We do not need to develop intricate parasocial relationships which players can leverage into brand deals; we need new people to post about! We need interesting new youths to wring through our take machine! We need, of course, freshmen, and already a couple have caught my eye. Think of this as an unofficial, non-exhaustive list of future stars. JuJu Watkins and Paige Bueckers, the season’s headliners, are plenty compelling themselves. All the more reason to place some novel obstacles in their way.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tuesday's game marked a measuring stick of sorts for both teams. The Jets, coming in with an NHL-record 14-1-0 start to their season, sought to keep the train rolling against one of the East's contenders. The Rangers, with functionally the same roster as the one that won the Presidents' Trophy a year ago, hoped to prove they're in the same league as the NHL's best. It was a fun one, a back-and-forth 6-3 Jets victory in which Winnipeg showed conclusively they're a cut above, playing relentless, mistake-free hockey behind the league's best forward line and in front of the scariest goalie in the world.
Connor Hellebuyck vs. Igor Shesterkin was the undercard, pitting two of the last three Vezina winners, and coming at a time when Shesterkin is trying to lap Hellebuyck and every other netminder with his pending contract. The game didn't quite play out as a duel—the Rangers turned the puck over too many times, and the Jets took too many penalties, for this one to feature any brilliant statlines in goal. Hellebuyck saved 33; Shesterskin stopped 27 of 32 for his second straight start allowing five goals.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fans of chromatically bold hardwood courts rejoice: The NBA's in-season tournament, freshly rebranded as the NBA Cup with a big fancy title sponsor, returned Tuesday night. In both basketball and business terms, last season's inaugural go-round was a success, though there's no guarantee that's a permanent condition. Even if it's bad, it will still be interesting, as the tournament will function as the league intends only if teams and players take it seriously, which requires them to make a series of revealing choices from among a handful of somewhat mutually exclusive options.
The NBA tipped the business ambitions of its FA Cup cosplay with the scheduling. Games take place on football-less Tuesdays and Fridays, in the hopes that the relative novelty and theoretically higher stakes will draw in larger audiences of curious casual viewers during the part of the NBA schedule when the games typically matter the least. Of course the NBA wants people to watch the first eighth of the interminable regular season, and the NBA Cup is a significantly more management-friendly alternative to shortening the schedule by the dozen or so games the union has occasionally asked for. If you're not going to engineer significance through scarcity, simply enrich the existing offerings.]]></summary>

It's a hyperrealistic, 16-foot aluminum pigeon—like pizza, the basic idea is good enough that I'm not really sure there's any version of the execution that wouldn't have satisfied me. But I had come specifically to see the pigeon, and achieved that goal, and wished I had been surprised by it instead. Turned a corner and been gobsmacked by the pigeon, or been riding up 10th Avenue and seen the pigeon in the distance, getting ever-closer and -larger. What the hell? would have been my ideal reaction to seeing the big pigeon for the first time. Why is there a pigeon here?
Well, why not? It's Manhattan. There are pigeons everywhere. Anywhere from half a million to nine million, depending on who you ask. Iván Argote, a Colombian artist living in Paris, has added one more with his sculpture which perches atop the High Line, an unused rail trestle turned linear park, and stares somewhat menacingly down on passing traffic. The sculpture is called Dinosaur (on display through spring 2026), and it does look more than a little saurian at this scale—the claws look like they could properly gut you, perhaps as revenge for all those times you didn't offer his smaller cousins any crumbs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before Monday night's game between the Miami Dolphins and Los Angeles Rams, ESPN reporter Jeff Darlington and Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa teamed up to produce one of the year's strangest pieces of NFL-related media.
Tagovailoa is exactly the sort of young, talented, charismatic quarterback that the league and its broadcasters crave in order to sell fans on a Monday night game between two mediocre teams, so it makes sense that he would be the centerpiece of ESPN's pregame coverage. Tagovailoa's marketability is complicated, however, by the fact that he recently completed yet another stint on the IR after being concussed in Week 2. Tagovailoa's career, from college to the pros, has been riddled with brain injuries, at such an alarming rate that many pundits were urging him to retire following the hit he took in September. Tagovailoa didn't retire, though, and now he's trying to salvage the Dolphins' season. It's a story worth telling, surely, but how exactly does a network sell the story to fans?]]></summary>

I do not consider it my business to engage in any even half-serious interrogation of this impression. The body requires protein, probably, and though I do enjoy gnawing on animal parts, it's a lot simpler to fire down a daily hit of protein out of a shaker bottle (or three) than it is to make sure I have handfuls of meat available in the fridge at all times. Every morning, I open the pantry and hunt around for the tub of protein powder. Very often on these hunts, I encounter other, different tubs, tubs and bags of things that look like protein powder but possibly are not, or tubs or bags of things that definitely are not protein powder, but look and smell like they are meant to be dissolved in water and then consumed, for health. Health being good, I find it wise simply to throw a scoop or two of these things into the shaker bottle, to make the resulting sludge maximally healthful.
Here are some things that are going into my current "protein" shake, in order of application.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bridget Everett is 52. She was 48 when HBO took on her show, Somebody Somewhere, now in its third and final season. The show, in which she plays the lead character, Sam, loosely depicts Everett’s own life, or at least the one she would have lived if she had stayed in Kansas instead of moving to New York, where she eventually became a downtown alt-cabaret star. If you consider her start getting her equity card around the age of 26, that’s a good two decades to get to the position she is in now, where her show is a Peabody Award winner and she no longer has to wait tables as a fallback. Depending on your perspective, that’s incredibly cool or incredibly nuts.
“Dreams don’t have deadlines.” The first time I saw Everett say that was in 2017, during an interview for the indie film Patti Cake$, in which she plays the alcoholic mother of a bartender (Danielle Macdonald) who aspires to become a rap star. “There’s a quote from LL Cool J,” Everett tells the young interviewer, laughing, “it’s DDHD—Dreams don’t have deadlines—and I live by that and I think everybody should live by it because it doesn’t matter if you’re 15, you’re 23, or you’re collecting retirement checks, just keep going for what makes you feel happy and follow and live your dream.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jaron "Boots" Ennis put himself in a KO-or-lose situation. So even while keeping his belt in what was a romp on the scorecards in Saturday’s IBF welterweight title fight against Karen Chukhadzhian in front of a hometown Philadelphia crowd, in the big picture Ennis hardly came away a winner. 
Over the summer, Ennis and his team booked what looked like a paid workout when he signed to face the Ukrainian, whom he’d already beaten by decision in January 2023 on the undercard of a Tank Davis fight. Boots had the title, the perfect record (32-0 with 29 knockouts), and a one-two combo of out-of-the-ring charm and on-the-job ferocity that put him in any conversation about boxing’s Next Big Thing. The 27-year old Philly native was maybe just one highlight-reel KO away from breathing the rare air that Tank breathes popularity-wise, hitting pay-per-view headliner status and getting what all boxers suddenly covet: An invite to Saudi Arabia. This was the fight that was supposed to get Ennis all that.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Manchester City loves to give rivals hope right before snatching it away. The four-peating Premier League champions started each of those consecutive title-winning campaigns with whimpers, relatively speaking, dropping at least eight points in Premier League play in each of them by about mid-November. Each of those stretches of (relatively) subpar play gave hope to everyone who supports a fellow title contender or simply (and justifiably) hates City's whole deal. But, as the saying goes, it's the hope that kills you, and City eventually crushed those hopes in each of those four seasons.
Right on time, the present day Citizens have entered the late-fall point of the schedule mired in a funk. Right now City sits in second place on the league table, having dropped 10 points in its first 11 matches. After a strong start to the campaign, the Mancs have hit the skids hard recently, currently stuck in a four-match losing streak across all competitions. The latest blow came in a come-from-ahead 2-1 loss to Brighton on Saturday.]]></summary>

Giannis had the ball on the block, drove to the defense's middle, and then attempted to pivot over his left shoulder, throwing out a cartoonishly long and pointy chicken wing to clear some shooting space; Brown, the primary defender, took the blow to the shoulder and head, and went down with a shout. The referees signaled an offensive foul and awarded the ball to the Celtics. Giannis offered Brown a conciliatory handshake and then cruelly yoinked it away, executing the rude "too slow" hair-smoothing maneuver and leaving Brown grasping at air.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If an accurate quarterback is a comfortable quarterback, then the Texans' pass rush made Jared Goff play like he was wearing cleats filled with Christmas tree needles for most of Sunday's night contest against the Lions. A one-loss signal-caller who entered Houston on a record pace for completion percentage, who hadn't thrown a ball to the wrong-colored jerseys since Week 3, looked without warning like a Lions QB from the old days, completing a season-low 50 percent of his 30 passes while tossing an increasingly confounding five interceptions as his boys trailed by as much as 23-7 in the second half. Still, all was forgiven in the end, as some Texan mistakes, a refocused offense, and a couple of clutch kicks all combined to deliver Detroit an inspiring comeback—26-23, with a walk-off field goal for the win. 
Most of what you need to know about Detroit's offense is this: In their one loss this season, Week 2 vs. Tampa Bay, Goff threw the ball 55 times. In all other games leading into their primetime clash against Houston, he'd maxed out at 28. The two prongs that allow this offense to plug into a power source are running backs David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs, and their punishing runs behind a fearsome offensive line are what open up opportunities for Goff to find his receivers on play-action pass plays. But the Texans' pressure in the early going both suffocated the run and forced Goff into uncharacteristic errors. On the game's opening drive, an energetic deflection by Jalen Pitre created a Jimmie Ward interception, and with the Lions down 13-7 in the second, Denico Autry got his hand on Goff while he threw and sparked a tip frenzy that eventually led to another Texans field goal. Detroit proceeded to go three-and-out on each of the next two drives, as Houston's aggression disrupted Goff's rhythm and refused to give him clear looks at his targets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FLATBUSH, BROOKLYN – It was 74 degrees on Election Day; I wore bike shorts on the two block walk to my polling site. The iced coffee in my hand proved unwieldy as I scanned my ballot, the poll worker’s hands fluttering nervously nearby. By the time I completed my civic duty, I still had most of my coffee left, along with a mostly free afternoon. When I messaged my editor to get a vibe check for the day, she told me “For election coverage, I think nobody has a sense of what to write right now but then it will get either pretty easy or pretty hard.” It was as true then as it is now. 
But I had that strangely beautiful afternoon ahead of me. It was the kind of day that tricks everyone into believing they like summer in New York, except it was early November. My face and legs began to prick with heat as I settled onto a park bench and lit a joint. A pickup basketball game unfolded before me. A group of teens gossiped at a table nearby, shedding their black puffer jackets as the sun's warmth intensified. I remembered a wish I’d made earlier that year, that this fall would be the most beautiful I’d ever witnessed. I wondered if it was a curse. In a group chat with my best friends, one of them, a culture editor at the New Yorker, said, “I hate to say this and I want to be wrong but I kind of think he’s going to win.” My legs began to burn; I pulled a book out of my bag, my jacket over my knees.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone in the stadium at Texas Tech's loss to Colorado on Saturday would have understood why Tech head coach Joey McGuire took it upon himself to seize a microphone and begin yelling at the home fans near the beginning of the fourth quarter. They would have seen what people watching at home did not, which was those fans throwing a bunch of garbage from the seats and onto the field while officials reviewed a Colorado sack that involved both a facemask penalty that was not called and a targeting infraction that first was, and then was overturned. While Dean Blandino explained to the TV audience what was happening, his traditional more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger tone was overtaken by something that sounded more like a Muppet that had been stuffed into a dryer against its will. That was McGuire, and he wanted everyone to knock it off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the absence of any actual recourse or meaningful agency where the material terms of your existence are concerned, you are permitted to create a reality of your own. You can't fully live there because there's nowhere to cook or sleep, but you can decorate it however you like. This space is not and cannot really ever be home, and also it is not even really safe—there are always sketchy guys letting themselves in and going through your stuff, grabbing at your wallet, constantly issuing what are very clearly threats in the form of insulting advice. There is a screen you can watch, but it mostly just shows commercials in a little box surrounded by tickers and betting lines and blaring chyrons lousy with incomprehensible AI babble, things that are shaped like words but are not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is early enough in the college basketball season that nothing really feels consequential yet. Most of the programs that will matter in March are still tuning up teams that won't, to the point where the scoreboard has kind of a pleasant abstraction to it. For every early match-up between North Carolina and Kansas—it really happened, on Friday night; Kansas won, it was a fun game—there are two that mostly serve to remind you what a vast and varied country this is. Kentucky and Bucknell? Arizona and Old Dominion? Auburn, but also Vermont? Provided you don't look at the scores in those games, which were decided by a combined margin of 137 points in favor of the programs you'd expect, it's kind of nice to think about. But it's conceptual, in the ways that basketball games played before Thanksgiving tend to be.
So much of the season hasn't happened yet that the broader stakes are not yet set, but it seems safe to say that Auburn's convincing 74-69 road win over Houston on Saturday night will matter. Houston, which came into the game ranked fourth in the country, is very good; Auburn, which was ranked 11th, won by getting second-half buckets with striking efficiency against one of the best defensive teams in the country. What was abstract and unrepresentative about Auburn's season-opening thrashing of Vermont—and they won that game 94-43, so that's basically everything—looked sharper and more significant on Saturday. The performance vaulted the Tigers to the top spot on the KenPom rankings, just ahead of Houston; the inherently unstable admixture of transfer portal ronin and multi-star recruits, which could always become anything, looked like a (very good) basketball team.]]></summary>
