        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dodgers pitching beast that had looked so invulnerable for the last two games of its series with the Padres and its first nine innings against the Mets suddenly toppled in the beginning of NLCS Game 2. Such are the momentum swings of the postseason, and such is the damage that sophomore third baseman Mark Vientos can do when he locks onto a ball from the batter's box.
After a glum 9-0 loss on Sunday night, it was Mr. Smile himself, Francisco Lindor, who gave the Mets a pick-me-up with a lead-off dinger to right against Dodger opener Ryan Brasier. That longball not only punctured L.A.'s lengthy scoreless streak, it also helped set up the key moment of the ballgame as Landon Knack labored through the second inning. Scooping up a couple of outs while allowing a single, a walk, and an RBI double, Knack was set to face the 1-for-1 Lindor with men on second and third and the score already 2-0. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts directed his man toward the correct strategic decision, sending Lindor to first on an imaginary quartet of balls. But the choice to face the next man in the order over Lindor only steamed up the Mets' two-spot hitter, who's no slouch himself.]]></summary>

I will give you a minute to compose yourself.
For the one or two of you unfamiliar with the sport, conkers is a traditional childhood game in the U.K. Players put a string through a horse chestnut seed and crash their conkers together. The player with the conker that breaks first loses the match and, presumably, their pride for losing at such an important sport. Here’s the entry from the Encyclopedia of Traditional British Sports, right after cock throwing. (I am not looking that one up.)

This week they’re getting a chance to do both after the team won, which perhaps raises the bar on what can be considered a perfect Eagles game. On Sunday the Eagles pretty much played like shit against a team they were expected to beat by more than a touchdown. Fans seemed pissed the whole game. Like, more than usual, and for more obvious reasons than usual.
Much of that ire went toward Nick Sirianni. He heard it during Sunday’s 20-16 win over the lowly Browns, a game in which the Eagles never trailed and never really seemed to get going. Philadelphia fans are rarely happy, but they had a right to complain in this one. The Eagles got wide receivers A.J. Brown and Devonta Smith back from injury. Lane Johnson returned to anchor the offensive line. The team was coming off a bye and playing at home one of the worst teams in the league. And while they got the job done, booing was a pretty reasonable response to the experience of watching them do it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Jets are a team that specializes in unfulfilled promise. The promise of the 2023 season was Aaron Rodgers's arrival, and was dashed the moment his Achilles tendon rolled up the back of his leg in the season opener. The start of this season brought even more promise: While Rodgers was out last year, the rest of the Jets' roster cohered into one of the league's more talent-rich outfits, and it wasn't hard to imagine a team that went 7-10 with Zach Wilson starting most of the games suddenly becoming a force after Rodgers reclaimed his position. A 2-3 start put a damper on things, but also opened the door for promises to be made. It was a coaching problem! With Robert Saleh shitcanned and Nathaniel Hackett stripped of his play-calling duties, the Jets would finally—finally!—be ready to transform into the great team their roster says they are supposed to be. Monday night's game against the Bills was a great opportunity for the Jets to finally start making good on some of those promises.
Did we see a transformed and re-energized Jets team on Monday night? Well, the offense looked better than it had. Todd Downing's play-calling opened some running lanes for Breece Hall that were previously hard to come by, and Rodgers had his best game as a Jet, throwing for 294 yards and two touchdowns. But is a team that is about to turn the corner one that loses 23-20 to a sputtering division rival at home? Is a team that has ironed out its inefficiencies one that nets one touchdown from four red-zone drives, gets repeatedly run over by Ray Davis and Ty Johnson, misses two field goals, and commits 11 penalties? The Jets under Saleh were a team that dropped way too many passes, drew way too many flags, and routinely undid itself with mistakes of all varieties. Our first look at the post-Saleh Jets indicates that this is still a team that drops way too many passes, draws way too many flags, and knows just how to undo itself with stupid mistakes.]]></summary>

Let us pretend, in this scenario, that you did not always switch back to the baseball game in time for the start of each inning, and sometimes missed a few pitches. Let us also imagine that at the start of the bottom of the third, you tuned in just in time to see Juan Soto crank a ball just over the wall in right-center. As he rounded the bases, you would naturally have turned your eyes to the score bug in the top-right of your screen. There, at first glance, and also second and third glances, you would notice the little bases graphic has second base a different color than the other two—lighter, filled in. You have been conditioned by a lifetime of score bugs to know what this means: There was a guy on second! Soto's was a two-run home run!
But no. It was a solo shot. The TBS graphic is just like that. It makes it look like there's always a runner a second.]]></summary>

Sent to investigate the ice-covered and perhaps habitable second moon of Jupiter, it is qualified by NASA as a Large Strategic Science Mission, conveying with that designation its outsized cost, the peak technical capabilities of its instruments, and the importance of the science it expects to undertake. It is just the seventh planetary science mission to receive the LSSM designation, an elite group that includes landmark missions like Voyager probes and Mars rovers.
The spacecraft itself is massive: the largest NASA's ever built. Twenty feet tall, 72 feet wide when its panels are deployed—about the length of an 18-wheeler—more than 13,000 pounds, nearly half of that propellant, the rest the lightest-weight tech there is. Look at this beast.]]></summary>

No one thinks of the Federal Emergency Management Agency except when their house has been reduced to a pile of debris and all the roads leading in and out of your city have been washed off the map. Or, for instance, when you see something on TikTok about the government corralling people in Florida and preventing them from evacuating ahead of catastrophic hurricanes. FEMA works almost exclusively in natural disasters, so there is a bleak logic to devoting pages on its website to fact-check a growing list of hurricane-related conspiracy theories.
"FEMA is not blockading people in Florida and preventing evacuations," one of the entries reads. "FEMA does not control traffic flow or conduct traffic stops, which are handled by local authorities. This is a harmful rumor that can put lives in danger."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BROOKLYN, N.Y. — I chuckled when I saw the words printed on the giveaway T-shirts at Finals Game 2 in New York on Sunday afternoon: “NOT DONE YET.” A kinder reading goes that all contenders think like this, no matter their situation. In the shadow of a Game 1 win, those words might have projected a noble kind of focus. We won’t rest on our regular-season laurels. Job’s not finished. Eyes on the prize. Giveaway shirt production lead times are probably not such that the Liberty ordered thousands of these to cope, anyway. But the shirts took on a slightly grimmer, funnier meaning in light of what actually happened in Game 1: an awful New York collapse. Now, methought the shirt doth protest too much. The “Our Season Is Definitely Not Over” T-shirt had people asking a lot of questions already answered by the shirt.
In a technical sense, it was true, though. The Liberty were not done yet. They still had a split to salvage in New York. And their home crowd, if volume was any sign, loved them no less for their choking. Fans might have felt a sense of déjà vu as the Liberty went up 17 points early, gutted through the second and third quarters, and then let the Lynx make it a one-possession game late in the fourth. But Breanna Stewart, she said afterward, was determined not to let “history repeat itself.” A determined Stewart is an awesome sight, and her arms made possible an alternate ending. Minnesota tried running back the small lineup that had worked for them in Game 1, but Stewart reminded them why it had always been a risky idea. She timed jumps like a defensive back to grab Minnesota lobs out of the air; she hung low to wreck entry passes and dribbles. After Courtney Williams skated past Jonquel Jones to make it a 68-66 game with 3:40 left to play, the Liberty ended the game on a 12-0 run. Stewart would finish with eight rebounds and a Finals-record seven steals, three of them in the fourth quarter.]]></summary>

Our once-beautiful and vibrant (OK, maybe it was never beautiful or vibrant) onside kick culture has suffered some real blows in the last year. The NFL effectively banned surprise onside kicks with its new kickoff rule, which allows onside kicks only in the fourth quarter and also requires the kicking team to declare they are onside kicking. But yesterday, these guys kept the culture alive. Let's consider their onside kick strategies:

The resulting sights could be something unfamiliar to fans: Detroit’s Beau Brieske, who hadn’t given up a home run off his fastball all season, serving up a go-ahead meatball to David Fry in Game 4; unhittable Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase allowing one less earned run in this series than he had all year. The threat of overexposure made each game feel extra tense. “It was such a fun series,” Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt said after Game 5 on Saturday, a 7-3 Guardians win. “Two very evenly matched teams going at it, and it was a lot of fun.” 
Though Cleveland’s path to the postseason wasn’t as bizarre as Detroit’s—the Guardians took first place in the division in mid-April and never relinquished it, despite scares from the Twins and Royals—they were both teams depending on run prevention. The Guardians offense cooled off in the second half, but the team stayed afloat thanks to an elite homegrown bullpen. An early-season injury to ace Shane Bieber, plus some underperformance from young arms, left the Guardians rotation in roughly the same [shrug emoji] shape as the Tigers’ heading into the postseason.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought the card in May of 2022. It was one of my many low-dollar purchases on eBay, made during one of my manic buying phrases; those tend to happen when I’m in a particularly good or particularly bad mood. “Stop buying things,” my wife will say when, say, a UK demo cassette of the song “Your Woman” by White Town arrives at the house. And I will reply, “But I’m in one of my manic buying phases when I am in a particularly good or particularly bad mood!” Eventually I toss the item in a box and forget about it, and then I try to remember to work on things in therapy and maybe ask for a medication tweak.
Anyway, this particular purchase was her fault for once. She was the one who told me about the card. Jan usually experiences sports vicariously through me, but she is a baseball fan. Our third date featured a long discussion about Bobby Estalella and whether he was the worst player named in the Mitchell Report. (Feel free to discuss in the comments.) So she knows a bit about sports cards. And one of the reasons we love each other so much is that she, like me, has a brain full of esoteric knowledge that could never, ever be useful in any scenario. Sometimes she tells me something wonderful and I just kiss her.]]></summary>

My eyes followed the precise lines that crossed each other again and again, each on its own predetermined path but also existing as a component of the whole. Humble straight lines drawn in pencil or crayon, multiplied to such a dizzying degree that when you stand back, they blend together into a wiggling mass that comes into and out of focus like an optical illusion. I wanted to run my fingers over the lines; I imagined I would be able to feel the ridges they made in the wall, the way my handwriting does in my notebooks. 
It was the last day of summer, and I was visiting Mass MoCA for the first time with a group of my former coworkers. It’s been seven years since we all worked together, and in that time our relationships have cohered more into a family. There were 10 of us there that day, plus two babies, so once we started looking at the art, we broke up into groups based on our pace, interests, and whether we had a toddler to chase.]]></summary>
