The administration enlisted Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to carry out unprecedented waves of widespread firings, buyouts, and reductions in force, many of which faced legal challenges. As of June 6, the labor department has reported the federal government has gotten rid of 59,000 jobs since January. These firings are deeply political. They intend to purge nonpartisan employees and replace them with loyalists.
This series puts names and faces to some of the thousands of civil servants whose lives and futures have been upended. They all share a commitment to public service and a belief that the government is supposed to help people.]]></summary>

The final day of the group play stage of the league’s in-season Commissioner’s Cup tournament involved six games in one night, the first five overlapping. On account of the odd number of WNBA teams right now, Copper’s Phoenix Mercury were the lucky 13th team out. They could simply kick up their feet and take in one of the more colorful nights the league has seen. What was her "Wow" about? We can only guess. These were my own Wows from each game:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some good news: The New York Yankees have now been shut out for three games in a row. This is in spite of mitigating factors such as facing the "Los Angeles" Angels of Anaheim and being newly Giancarlo Stanton'd up. Take a 2–0 loss to the Boston Red Sox, a 1–0 loss in 11 innings in the ghost runner era, and a 4–0 loss to Kyle Hendricks's 86 mile-per-hour fastball, et voilà: The Yankees are now the third team this year to achieve this storied feat, joining the Cincinnati Reds and the Colorado Rockies. That's company you want to be keeping.
Unlike the Reds and the Rockies, who accomplished the feat through the tried and true strategy of not getting on base, the Yankees have gone the much more convoluted route of getting runners on base and stranding them there. They have left as many runners on base as the Reds and Rockies had combined during their respective streaks. In their 11-inning shutout loss, the Yankees had the bases loaded and Hunter Strickland on the mound. Anthony Volpe grounded out to end the game. A classic mishap of putting in more effort to get the exact same results: zero runs, zero wins. In some ways, you have to respect it.]]></summary>

Just as predictable is the kind of books that will appear on these lists. These books are recent, they are already well-publicized, and they are generally described as suited to one particular location (the beach). But summer, and summer reading, is capacious. It's more than the feeling of being on vacation and more than the books you might buy at the airport. This is why we decided to give you a different kind of summer reading guide.
Our list is full of books that we genuinely endorse that are not all super new or super popular. We tried to pick books that went with summer's various and specific moods, or that we might not have a good excuse to recommend otherwise.

Some of this funk can be explained by the U.S. team getting embarrassed on the field. Until they hung five goals on poor Trinidad and Tobago over the weekend, the USMNT had lost four straight games by an aggregate score of 9-2. Two of those were competitive games against CONCACAF rivals and two were friendly losses to legit European teams, though there's little point in drawing a distinction between the pairs of matches, because the stakes in both were the same: nothing. Losing is one thing. The larger and thornier issue is that if the team were winning, all they could win would be a reprieve from people paying attention to the program's structural bustedness.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["You can't be a serious critic," New York Times technology reporter Kevin Roose wrote on Tuesday, on Bluesky, about artificial intelligence, "if you're in denial about how useful it is." Narrowly, in strict terms, this is true: You can't be a serious critic of anything if you are in denial about any part of it, where "in denial" describes an irrational and unfounded rejection of empirical reality. That's hardly even worth saying, but it's also not really what Roose is saying.
What Roose wants is to put an entire suite of claims about the technology presently doing business as "artificial intelligence"—not just that it has more than zero uses (a thing nobody really denies) but that it truly is artificial intelligence or anything like it; that it represents a profound leap forward for technology and human endeavor; that it is the future; that, as such, adopting it and integrating it into day-to-day work and life processes is the smart move—beyond dispute. He wants to marginalize the many technology experts, media knowers, and sharp lay readers who have for years been calling his work on behalf of those claims appalling boobery. He wants his readers to view all of those critics as coterminous with whatever minor body of irrelevant five-follower internet loons might bother trying to argue the literal uselessness of a predictive text generator or a program that collates search engine results into layperson's language. He wants his readers to think of all the critics as united in an essentially pathological relationship with the observable world. And he wants the juice of dancing this shitty little passive-aggressive jig on Bluesky, the social-media platform where many of those critics will encounter his work and, while dunking on it, also share it around to some number of people who will read it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are some things you can learn about fascism before you actually learn them during fascism, and there are others that you can only learn through experience. The fundamental instability of fascist political formations is one of those. The stupid and scattershot brutality of every moment, the relentless and obvious lying and the variously shameful ways in which institutions quail or qualify or quit in the face of it, the regular paroxysms of political violence and self-harm, the freakish and orgiastic backstabbing and self-dealing and perversity of a depraved new ruling class—all of this is real, but day by day they are experienced less as identifiable attributes of fascism and more as the dumb daily fact of it.
Both in the literature and in the moment, that stupid and strident chaos is the natural result of the scammers and degenerates and opportunists that populate those regimes doing the things they do, and of the desperate and deluded political moments and populaces that tend to produce fascism, and of the self-annihilating grandiosity of the gold-plated godheads that squat atop it all, trying to freeze that churn into permanence through the application of state violence and sheer idiot will. It is all jarring and idiotic and miserable, and as it fails around you there really isn't much comfort in the knowledge that it Actually Doesn't Work. In the long run, it absolutely doesn't, but the people in charge do not believe in the long run; the work of their project is to freeze the present in place, and to defy whatever reckoning tomorrow might bring. Everyone else is trapped in that unending day with them, a place where bad things are always happening but nothing ever resolves. Reading about fascism will tell you about how it begins and how it works and even how it tends to end, but it can only tell you so much about how it feels.]]></summary>

The 1938–40 Toronto Maple Leafs managed it when the National Hockey League was only seven or eight teams deep and all you had to do to compete was not go bankrupt, and the 1968–70 St. Louis Blues got swept three consecutive times as an expansion team when one of the two divisions was all expansion teams.
Thus, it is hard to conceive of the Edmonton Oilers as they are this morning, first beaten and then hammered by the Florida Panthers in successive years, not having to live with this feeling for years to come. Knowing that the other guy is better one year is hard to endure, but knowing that the same guy got almost incalculably better a year later makes this a more existential defeat.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Panthers are the reason your favorite team stinks. Not because they've ruined all those other teams' records, though they have, but because Florida has successfully built what every front office in a copycat league has and will continue to ineffectively flail toward. Everyone holds up "toughness" as the ideal form of playoff hockey. They want to get "tougher." Meaner. More physical. They ignore the part, or take shortcuts around it because it's difficult to achieve, where Florida's toughness is merely a flavor of its skill. The Panthers are good. They score goals and they wear down defenses and generally make life difficult for opposing skaters because they finish their checks and protect their guys and drive you slobberingly insane with rage because they know where the line is, and play comfortably just on either side of it. 
Your favorite team, in search of toughness to help get over a playoff hump, will do things like—say—sign Ryan Reaves for three years. The Panthers, on the other hand, will do things like trade for Matthew Tkachuk and let him define their whole identity, or acquire Sam Bennett for a song and watch him win the Conn Smythe, or get Brad Marchand (poster boy for "good enough that he doesn't need to do the extracurriculars, but better for having them in his bag") at the deadline.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Club World Cup kicked off over the weekend in the United States, and it's been a wild ride so far, in the most derogatory way possible. It's not so much about the games themselves, which have been mostly either stodgy goalless draws or one-sided beat-downs (thanks for coming, Auckland City, enjoy your 10-0 defeat to Bayern Munich!) in front of small, generally disinterested crowds (who could've imagined that a Monday afternoon match between Chelsea and LAFC in Atlanta wouldn't exactly pack the stadium?). Instead, the real action for this rebranded and expanded version of the tournament has come off the pitch, as the tournament kicks off amidst nationwide protests and Donald Trump's quest to be the most special dictator he can be. Luckily for Trump, he has FIFA bending the knee left and right.
The concept of the Club World Cup itself may be exciting on paper—never-before-seen matchups! true global representation! concrete proof that MLS does indeed suck!—but all of its ostensibly commendable aims are undermined by the core truth that this tournament exists solely to make FIFA lots of money, player welfare, fan interest, and competitive integrity be damned. That core truth is why the newfangled tournament never seemed all that compelling for those of us who don't stand to make millions from either producing or participating in it; the Trumpy specifics of this particular edition—all the reports about ICE and Customs and Border Protection showing up to games, as well as requests that everyone attending bring proof of citizenship, residency, or their visas—soured an already sour proposition.]]></summary>

In moving four certified mammals to the Boston Red Sox for designated hitter and apparent pain in the ass Rafael Devers, the Giants finally achieved the big get they hadn't managed since they outbid themselves by $40 million for Barry Zito in 2006. That one was an analytic misstep, unless you count Zito’s two postseason starts in 2012, in which he won Game 5 of the NL Championship Series (with the Giants down 3-1 to the St. Louis Cardinals) and then Game 1 of the World Series. Those two starts made the deal a barg . . . well, okay, not a bargain. But at least some value for the money. Also he could play guitar.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At some point this season, Shohei Ohtani pitching and hitting will once again become ordinary, and only when he does something truly extraordinary will it be worth writing about. We are not yet at that point in the season. The Ohtani coverage will continue until the pitch count improves. It speaks to the absurd density of what has changed about Shohei Ohtani that this is the situation of his first start in nearly two years: He threw his first 28 pitches in a Dodgers uniform on the same day that his former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, reported to federal prison.
I would like to hype up the outing with more than that. Ohtani's return to the mound is not a novelty, as some might have feared after he left the Los Angeles Angels—for any criticism allotted to the Angels, you have to admit that they were in a position to let Ohtani do whatever he wanted. As previously noted, the Dodgers desperately need starting pitching. And so they had to take the option of a glorified rehab start, considering the minor league dilemma: As pitcher Ohtani and hitter Ohtani are the same person (allegedly; I have only seen one of him at any given time), his rehab start necessarily had to take place against the San Diego Padres as opposed to, say, the Round Rock Express. It was arguably overshadowed by Dylan Cease hitting Andy Pages with a fastball, and Padres manager Mike Shildt shouting, "Who the fuck do you think you are?" after Pages expressed some displeasure at taking 98 miles-per-hour to the arm. In otherwise, average Dodgers–Padres June game shenanigans.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I guess you could read that headline as some sort of condemnation of the Oilers' brass—that we're at Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Final, an elimination game for Edmonton, and there's still so much uncertainty surrounding a key position. But I mean it in the most literal sense possible. Kris Knoblauch presumably knows by this point who it will be, but if anyone tells you they know who's the better option, they're lying. Nobody knows!
While the Panthers have made it to within a game of clinching their second straight Cup on the back of Sergei Bobrovsky and only Sergei Bobrovsky, the Oilers got through the past two months with a chaotic combo in net. They began with their primary starter, Stuart Skinner. The 26-year-old looked like the answer to their crease problem when he first slotted into the role a couple of years ago, but has only declined from there. Skinner almost handed the team an early exit, looking absolutely helpless in his first couple games against the Kings. He was replaced by the 33-year-old Pickard, a fringe NHLer whose only season as a starter saw him lead the league in losses for Colorado in 2017. Inexplicably, Pickard won four straight for the Oilers to get the series win, and even though a couple of those games were 7-4 and 6-4, Edmonton was in no position to complain.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[April McClain Delaney, House representative for Maryland's 6th congressional district, did not get off to a hot start in her address to Frederick, Md.'s modest-sized but otherwise energetic and very positive "No Kings" protest on Saturday. As soon as she took the microphone, a few people on the back side of the little pavilion at the center of Mullinix Park began heckling her; at first, a whole crowd away and out of sight from the hecklers, I thought they were pro–Donald Trump counterprotesters, but I made my way over there and found that they were actually anti-Trump protesters, perhaps the anti-Trump-iest people there, and were mad specifically at the congressperson.
When McClain Delaney spoke of the need to stand up to the Trump administration's terrorism of immigrant communities, one of the hecklers shouted "Then don't thank ICE!" This seemed like it was probably a reference to her vote in favor of a congressional resolution expressing "gratitude to law enforcement officers, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel, for protecting the homeland." I didn't get a chance to ask any of them, but I'd wager they were also unhappy with McClain Delaney's vote for the Laken Riley Act calling on ICE to detain and deport immigrants arrested for—but not convicted of or even charged with—nonviolent offenses. Or her vote for a Republican-sponsored bill overturning the city of Washington, D.C.'s immigration laws and forcing its officials to cooperate with DHS and ICE.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A romantic comedy often opens with a scene where the protagonist demonstrates that she's not like other girls. In Legally Blonde, that's Reese Witherspoon slipping her freshly painted toenails into wedge heels with a heart on them, before she heads out to the date that will ruin all her plans. In Pride & Prejudice (2005), that's Keira Knightley reading while she walks outside, and returning home to her chaotic family. In Materialists—the new Celine Song movie released over the weekend—Dakota Johnson applies lip gloss in a mirror and runs out onto the New York City streets, her high ponytail swinging. She passes a tall man, stops him, and offers him her card. She's a matchmaker named Lucy, and he's tall and rich and would be great for her clients.
But that's not the first scene in Materialists. The movie opens with a vast red-rocked canyon filling the screen. It is beautiful and immense. Then we watch a long-haired prehistoric man chop a bushel of daisies, put it into a backpack, and carry it to a cave where a woman waits for him. They do not speak. The man then twists the stem of one of the daisies into a ring and slips it onto the cave woman's left ring finger. Get it? It's not a diamond. It's just a flower. That's love, baby.]]></summary>

The Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, host site of the Canadian Grand Prix, encircles an island in Montreal. It is a gorgeous circuit, featuring the close-hewn walls of a street race, a run through lush greenery rivaling even the aesthetics of the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, and marmots. Groundhogs, specifically, who have found a circuit raised upon their homes and stayed put, to infrequent risk of extreme bodily harm, i.e. decapitation or bisection.
On turn 13, Lewis Hamilton hit a groundhog that was on track with his Ferrari. The remainder of the groundhog stayed as debris on the track, shown a few times throughout the race. Hamilton was smartly not informed of this fact during the race, which, thanks to resulting floor damage and poor pit-stop timing, he spent largely treading water on an island in P6. The nature of automobiles leads to somewhat flippant and/or nervously hysterical reactions to loss of animal life—during the weekend's running of 24 Hours of Le Mans, the delirious night session commentators' processing of a local rabbit death included a (unobserved?) moment of silence and the term "derabbitized"—but the vegan Hamilton was naturally upset after the race. There may be a crude metaphor in there for how things are going at Ferrari this year, though it remains to be seen who exactly is the groundhog.]]></summary>

Battling relentless rain that essentially gave Sunday's action an extended halftime break, contending players like Adam Scott and Sam Burns sunk themselves with final-round scores of 78 and 79 respectively, as a course saturated with water worked to make their lies as miserable as possible. To put golfers in these conditions is like trying to make Sabrina Ionescu shoot threes in a wind tunnel, or Harry Kane take a penalty with a ball made of lead. It stops being about "Who's the best?" and starts being about "Who can survive?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the Red Sox closed out their three-game series at home against the Yankees on Sunday afternoon, spirits were high. The win made for a sweep of their division rivals and put the Red Sox half a game back of a wild card spot. A middling rotation haunted Boston for much of the season and especially in early June, but now they’d won on the strength of their pitching, which held Yankees bats to four total runs all weekend. 
At the start of the week, Roman Anthony, the top prospect in baseball, joined Kristian Campbell and Marcelo Mayer in the big leagues to complete the arrival of the team’s long-awaited ‘Big Three’ prospect trio. If these young, promising lads weren’t exactly contributing “hits” as they adjusted to MLB pitching, they still kept the vibes all nice and hopeful. It doesn't get much better than this, some fathers and their children celebrating at Fenway may have thought, as they watched Rafael Devers clobber an insurance solo homer onto the ledge of the Green Monster.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a defensible reading of Game 4 of the NBA Finals as an aesthetic disappointment, a slugfest of a game defined by Bennedict Mathurin missing a bunch of free throws in the final minute and the Oklahoma City Thunder shooting a collective 3-for-16 from three-point range and recording a collective 11 assists, both season lows. Certainly, if you wanted to read the game through the lens of individual offensive brilliance, you'd find the text lacking, though to do so would be to voluntarily step back from the bleeding edge of basketball. Game 4 was not only the best game of what has been a great series, but a klaxon from the future, the highest-level example of the sort of collective, pure-pressure hoops that's been the story of this season.
The ghastly 3-for-16 figure is an instructive place to start, as it is an extremely aberrant statistic. What it shows is not so much a Thunder offense that played poorly, but a Pacers defense that strung together a near-perfect night of defense. The most thoughtfully articulated concerns about the ubiquity of the three-pointer in modern NBA basketball arrive at the point that the three makes NBA offense fundamentally unstoppable, the spatial advantages of parking a bunch of guys on the perimeter rendering the game into a mere shooting contest. The defense played by both the Pacers and the Thunder makes a mockery of that assertion, as both units managed to shut down the opponents' long-range shooting without surrendering open looks at the rim.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first big trade of the NBA offseason arrived yesterday, and it was one that no one saw coming: Memphis Grizzlies shooting guard Desmond Bane has been shipped off to the Orlando Magic in exchange for Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Cole Anthony, and four unprotected first-round picks.
Four first-round picks for a guy who as never made an all-star tea—shhhhh. I am going to keep my index finger pressed to your lips until you finish hearing what I have to say: Yes, a bushel of first-round picks is the kind of thing you expect to see included in a trade package for a real-deal superstar, which Bane is not. But to call this an overpay by the Magic would be to ignore how deals actually get done in the NBA. Players of a certain status are able to heavily influence and in some cases entirely dictate their own movements in the trade market, meaning that if a team like Orlando wants to hoard a pile of first-round picks until a true franchise savior becomes available to them, they are likely to be sitting on those picks forever. You can only play in the corner of the market that's available to you, and Orlando found a big prize in theirs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wasn't sure what to expect when I started listening to Roommates, the gambling-sponsored podcast hosted by New York Knicks Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart. My familiarity with the two is recently acquired—a friend introduced me to them and their fellow Villanova alumni Mikal Bridges and Donte DiVincenzo back during the headiest days of the "Nova Knicks" phenomenon, before DiVincenzo was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Karl-Anthony Towns. Admittedly, my interest waned once the quartet became a trio. But that was before the Knicks entered the playoffs and New York City exploded.
Seemingly overnight, the city was covered in blue and orange. Suddenly, I couldn't go to the gym without someone uttering phrases that might as well have been code: pick-and-roll, bing bong, double overtime, Reggie Miller. If I'm being honest, it wasn't until the Knicks started their third playoff series against the Pacers that I finally understood that Game 5 is actually closer to Game 20 for these players. But by the time my older brother told me he was planning to come to New York if the Knicks won the whole thing, my curiosity had officially been piqued.]]></summary>

Coming after days of anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles, as the community there fights to protect immigrants from kidnapping and torture, the "No Kings" demonstrations contrasted with a dull, dorky military parade Trump held for his own amusement on the same day in Washington D.C.
Protesters in Los Angeles, specifically, faced yet more violence from police, who charged at a crowd on horseback, beat people with batons, fired projectiles, and used tear gas. In Minnesota, protesters gathered after that day's assassination of Democratic state Rep. Melissa Hortman and attempted killing of Democratic state Sen.

As if the Florida Panthers taking a 3-2 series lead in front of a passionate Edmonton Oilers crowd wasn't brutal enough, it had to be the NHL's premier pest who orchestrated the 5-2 win in Game 5 on Saturday night. After scoring the team's last two goals in Game 2's OT win and following that up with the play that kicked off a blowout in Game 3, the 37-year-old trade deadline pickup from Boston scored Nos. 9 and 10 of his playoffs to help the Panthers to within one win of their second straight Stanley Cup. All Edmonton could do in response is curse him and pray for two straight victories.
With Game 4's exhilarating comeback win, the Oilers took back home-ice advantage in this series, and the fans flaunted it with a beautiful "O Canada" singalong before puck-drop. But what followed was pretty depressing from start to finish, and it began with Marchand's opening goal 10 minutes into the first, which came from pure hustle and speed. Watching a face-off after an out-of-play, Marchand pounced on what was technically a Draisaitl win before any other Oilers could get to the puck. He was so quick, and in such good position, that he instantly eliminated most of the opposing skaters from the play. Taking the puck right down the middle, he swerved around one defenseman and protected himself from the other, lasering a shot high on a Calvin Pickard that had gone low.]]></summary>

The various castoffs that make up the rotation are mostly pitching acceptably, and the franchise's strategy of immediately calling up their '22 and '23 first rounders has looked real smart. Continuing this philosophy, on Friday the club called up their 2024 first rounder, second baseman Christian Moore.
Normally, when a team brings a highly touted 22-year-old to the show, you can write something about him like "this guy's been tearing up the minors." But Moore's stats are actually pretty startling. He's striking out 27 percent of the time down there. And his defense has been terrible. What is Perry Minasian thinking? Well, when he looks at his infield, what he's probably thinking is Oh no. Here's a rundown of the Angels' non-Moore infielders this season. They've been, well, unique. In order of plate appearances:]]></summary>

"Is this boring?" I'll ask a few minutes into a story. "Am I boring you?" People usually laugh and say something like, You'll know if I'm bored. But I never used to do that. I never used to be self-conscious about, I don't know, wasting time? I was listening to a podcast recently and Loyle Carner, this British musician, mentioned how grateful he was that this author he had read had basically summarized her whole book in the first chapter, because even when he has every good intention, he won't always finish the entire thing. He sounded sheepish about it. I don't know why. The fact that he reads is rare enough, right? 
"Stick with it," my brother said when I started watching Dept. Q. "It's a slow burn." I mean, that's one way to put it. The first episode of Dept. Q is a SLOG. I was really excited going in—a Scottish show about a basement-dwelling trio of cold-case detectives starring a scruffy Matthew Goode and the amazing-faced actress Kate Dickie as his long-suffering boss? Yes, it sounds a little like Slow Horses, but how is that a bad thing? But then I started watching it and thought: Is this an assignment? This show looks like no one wants to be here, down to the set designer. Goode is phoning it in, the flashbacks are excessive, the pacing is so glacial it's basically stagnant. It was all so ... uninspiring, so generic, like someone fed "dark uk detective series" into an AI model. I couldn't figure out why this was happening: Did they not have much money? Was this Netflix's fault? I texted my brother midway through that first episode: "Are you using slow burn as a euphemism for boring?" He texted back: "Stick with it."]]></summary>

"I really liked the work, but it was emotionally devastating, because you got very wrapped up in your clients' cases," Giovagnoli said. She felt that only the prosecutors held real power; Giovagnoli would make her clients' cases, but the final decision was out of her hands. Then something clicked. "I realized that public service for me probably meant trying to be within the government to improve things," she said.
With this in mind, Giovagnoli became an attorney for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and spent the next two decades switching between jobs with the government and nonprofits, eventually focusing on the welfare of unaccompanied children, meaning any child under 18 who arrives in the United States without a parent or guardian. Since 1997, a legal settlement called the Flores agreement has enshrined basic rights and protections for children held in federal immigration custody. "The agreement acknowledged that children have unique needs and response and we have a unique responsibility to them," Giovagnoli said. "That the goal should not be to keep children in detention, but to release them to a family member as quickly and as safely as possible, keep them in as least restrictive a setting as possible."]]></summary>

I will also now immediately display ingratitude by ignoring what you said in your lovely introductory essay and say that I read this book as a metaphor. Specifically, it felt to me of a piece with another genre of slim, semi-autobiographical volume from a European writer: an account of a woman being driven to madness by an obsession for which she is willing to suffer, by which I mean, of course, being catastrophically in love with some guy. The way Krabbé is alternately so clear-eyed and willing to lie to himself, the debasement followed by the self-aggrandizement, the devotion unto despair… these all felt quite familiar to me as a fan of that other genre of book!
Kathryn: It’s funny, Brandy, because I also experienced it as a semi–psychological horror, though for the same reasons that Patrick mentions in his essay, in terms of how narrow the focus of the novel is on the act of competition. Absent projection or meaning-making, the emotional extremes of competitiveness wind up being so petty and ugly and ignoble—which is useful to be reminded of as I’ve gotten into more of the fucked up, suffering-based sports out there (tennis, the concept of Marc Márquez in MotoGP). Though I am also beginning to believe that cycling is just psychological horror.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Edmonton Oilers' maddening, decade-long goalie controversy is over ... for the next week, anyway. As that next week contains the entirety of what is now a best-of-three Stanley Cup Final, it feels like a mercy. Calvin Pickard, after two periods and most of an overtime of effective relief in Thursday's absurd 5–4 win, will be the man between the pipes, as there is simply not enough time left to survive any sort of disaster that might tempt head coach Kris Knoblauch to go back to Stuart Skinner.
This is not necessarily the ideal situation. (Say what you will about Sergei Bobrovsky and his contract and his very good but not elite play—there's something to be said for just not having to ever worry about the position.) It's certainly not a normal one for a team two wins from a Cup, to be still figuring out its best netminder. But nothing these Oilers do is normal. They became just the seventh team in NHL history, and the first since 2006 to come back from three goals down to win a Cup Final game. They became the first team ever to do it after digging that three-goal deficit in the first period. They couldn't have squirmed (clawing is for Panthers) back into it without Pickard. They might not have made it out of the first damn round.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trying to figure out how Leon Draisaitl's game-winning goal found glory when it barely found 30 mph is a waste of your time. What you should be noticing instead in the wake of Edmonton's wonderfully absurdist 5–4 overtime victory over Florida in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Final is how delightfully it fits into the broader theme these two teams have crafted over two seasons. Namely, that they are the perfectly weighted rivalry for our time: two teams that when they attempt to be their own best selves adhere to each other, separated only when one team or the other loses its way and tries to be the other team's opponent rather than the idealized version of itself.
So ignore for a moment the sheer dumb luck of Draisaitl's rush that resulted in a modest backhand that ever so slightly deflected off Florida defenseman Niko Mikkola and past Florida goaltender Bob. The result, which evened the series at two wins apiece, and the time, 11:36 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, are the explanation. Well, unless you think Taylor Swift had something to do with it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Watch basketball games for a living and you develop a certain tolerance for garbage—a fondness, even. Bad teams make visible all the neat and complicated parts of the sport. In an “I can fix them” sort of way, these teams are sometimes the most endearing. It's hard to look at even the WNBA’s worst without finding something to grasp, some little thread of hope. 
Alas, I’m drawing a blank with the Chicago Sky, who are 2-6, both of those wins over the league-worst 1-10 Dallas Wings. In retrospect, the Sky’s disastrous start to the season makes perfect sense. An offense that ranked near the bottom of the league in 2024 lost its leading scorer in the offseason. At the trade deadline last year, it also lost its second-best scorer. The Sky locker room might be more functional for the absence of Chennedy Carter and Marina Mabrey, but the two of them did score points! It is also a team theoretically built to feature two non-shooting bigs, one of whom is currently the league’s worst finisher.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a time in my youth where the anticipation of a concert was better than the concert itself. I saw a whole lot of incredible acts back then, but my memories of those shows are largely confined to their buildup. I remember waiting for hours—in a line that wrapped around the local Dayton’s department store—to score tickets to Van Halen, feeling like a prince when I reached the window and they still had seats left. I remember the giant, Hysteria-themed scrim that shielded Def Leppard’s in-the-round stage, and the band, from view before they went on. I remember standing on the main floor before a Poison concert with my friend Tony, gawking at all the women in attendance who had dressed themselves with the intent to score an invite backstage. Great moment to be a ninth grader.
Above all else, I remember the excitement. The electrical current inside of my body, growing to a crescendo as showtime drew nearer and nearer. The energy I intuited from everyone else in the arena as we endured the wait for the headliner to take the stage. The music blasting through the PA that kept getting louder and louder, to prime everyone for the real thing. And finally, the lights going off and all of us breaking into a spontaneous roar, a roar so loud that I couldn’t hear my own screams through it. I remember all of that, and in some ways that’s enough.]]></summary>

But let's play the game anyway and laugh the fit of our trousers off at the number of teams that have received requests from the New York Knicks to talk to their coaches about a new job and responded with an emphatic "Shove off, Guitar Boy."
To date, Dallas, Minnesota, Houston, and Atlanta have all refused Knicks chief ball guy Leon Rose and owner Jimmy Dolan permission to discuss their vacancy with, in order, Jason Kidd, Chris Finch, Ime Udoka, and Quin Snyder. Of those four, Atlanta's refusal was described as "emphatic." One presumes that is code for "shove off," but it could have been “no way,” “get bent,” or something more profane. Possibly much more profane. Again, there’s just so much about this process that is invisible to the public.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sports are simple. That is perhaps their most crucial property, the attribute that makes sports interesting to write and read about yet simultaneously makes doing so depend, to greater or lesser degrees, on mistranslation. The French Open final, an afternoon Golden State Valkyries game, Stage 20 of the Giro d'Italia: These are all rich texts that can be mined for pathos, meaning, and critical perspectives on gender, pan-European identity in the 21st century, or whatever, but at their core, none of them are "about" anything larger than their competitive structure. The games happen on their own terms and are projected outward for us, the non-competing public, to contextualize them as we see fit. But what is lost in any such act of projection?
That's one of the questions raised and dealt with in Tim Krabbe's The Rider, a work that achieves transcendence via fidelity. Krabbe's semi-autobiographical novel, translated from the Dutch by Sam Garrett, is extremely simple. He tells the story of the Tour de Mount Aigoual, "the sweetest, toughest race of the season," taking the reader kilometer-by-kilometer through the race, using its climbs, weather systems, and intrapeloton dynamics as entry points to write about the theory, practice, and what could fairly be characterized as the esoteric mysticism of road cycling. Krabbe is a somewhat tragic figure, a chess player who only became a rider in his early 30s, someone who had the talent to win more frequently and at a higher level than he ever was able to but started too late to be anything more than a very good amateur.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's impossible for me to think about Brian Wilson, who died on Wednesday, without picturing myself awake in my teenage bedroom at some sort of goblin hour. I still have very late nights, but they look a lot different—healthier, more organized. If I lose sleep now, it's because I'm so busy. If I lost a lot of sleep then, it was ... well, I guess you'd just call it anxiety. I wouldn't be able to sit still, or relax my brain, because my body just didn't want to shut off. I'd write jittery little poetry in my notebook, and pace around what little space I had, and listen to the Beach Boys.
I don't remember a specific moment where I was introduced to them, but at some point in my teen years, as I developed both taste in music and an interest in drugs, I got a burned-CD copy of Pet Sounds. Rounding out the collection soon after was the download of a sprawling Beach Boys greatest hits album from the library, and a more questionably obtained digital copy of The Smile Sessions, a big set devoted to the almost mythical, partially failed studio work that followed up the band's arrival on the absolute cutting edge of modern pop. That was my Beach Boys canon, and there were a few tracks in particular that I'd cycle through again and again when it felt like nobody else was awake. "Surf's Up," a delicate piano ballad that flips the whole fun-loving simplicity of the group's signature tunes on its head. "Caroline, No," a plaintive longing for eternal love. And of course, "God Only Knows," this divine wind that blows into your ears and leaves you (or at least me) forever changed, stunned by the possibility of melody and arrangement. I'd listen to these and write, but maybe more often I'd listen and just focus intently on them, my unslowing brain wrapping itself around every note. Hearing Wilson's songs, I felt separate from the world I knew.]]></summary>

Take “Wouldn’t It Be Nice,” which I’d say is my favorite Beach Boys tune if you asked me right now, the day after Wilson died at 82 years old. The song, the first track from Pet Sounds, the band's peerless 1966 album which Wilson produced, arranged, and wrote most of, finds a young man wanting more out of life and love than he’s getting, and hoping a day comes when he gets it.  Wouldn’t it be nice to be happy?]]></summary>

Throughout these playoffs, the Thunder have always felt like the constant in the equation that makes up any one game. We could head into every game assured that the Thunder were A) going to apply immense pressure on the other team through physical and aggressive defensive play, and B) make plenty of room for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to turn the screws at the other end with his shotmaking, driving, and foul-drawing. Those things always happening didn't necessarily mean that the Thunder would always win, but if they lost it was because an unexpected variable showed up somewhere else. Maybe the other team managed not to turn the ball over, or got unsustainably hot from three; maybe Mark Daigneault overthought his rotations or his late-game strategy; maybe someone hit a miracle shot at the buzzer.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Laura Mata López was born and raised in a low-income community in San José, Costa Rica. Some of her earliest memories were of the impact poverty and a lack of support for mental health had on her neighbors. Mata López's mother and grandmother had migrated to Costa Rica from Colombia during the Colombian civil war, severing them from their roots and family. For a period of time, Mata López's family was undocumented in Costa Rica, although their route to citizenship there was fairly easy. "Even then, I always had this identity of being a migrant and being an other," Mata López said.
When Mata López was 12 years old, she immigrated to New York City, where her mother cleaned houses. When she started school, Mata López became selectively mute, a condition she could not name at the time. She was overcome with a knot in her throat when her mom dropped her off at school, only regaining the ability to speak when she returned home and spoke with her family in Spanish.]]></summary>

I think it much more likely he just wears this around all the time, even to formal events where it's entirely inappropriate. Have you met people from Chicago? He probably sold his mitre to buy a sandwich.
This fairly definitively puts to bed any lingering debate about which accursed Chicago franchise gets to claim the Pope, though the Cardinals and Padres could still make a case. In any event, the former Robert Prevost surely claims the White Sox—that is the face of a man who just heard that Jerry Reinsdorf might not sell the team until 2034.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton under the headline "Tom Cotton: Send In The Troops, For Real." The piece was ostensibly written in response to the protests against the Trump administration's anti-immigrant crackdowns currently taking place in Los Angeles, and it argues that the administration should use an "overwhelming show of force" to put an end to the protests.
It's an odd piece of writing. For one thing, the troops have already been sent in—President Trump has sent National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles to guard federal buildings and ICE agents, against the wishes of California Governor Gavin Newsom. For another, the "show of force" has already happened—protestors have spent the last five days being beaten, arrested, tear-gassed, and shot with debilitating "less lethal" munitions. Taken on its own, it's hard to imagine what the editors of the WSJ opinion page might have expected moderately informed readers to gain from Cotton's piece, other than a vague sense of confusion and the less-vague sense that a United States Senator was upset.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve made my fair share of terrible relationship decisions. There was the time my college sweetheart and I decided we would break up at the end of the semester, but stay together for the ensuing four months. There was the time I decided to date an ex of my nemesis. There was the time I decided it would be appropriate second-date behavior to light candles in every room my rental—in Tucson, in July, at 2:00 p.m. And then there was the time I agreed to an open relationship for the wrong reasons. 
This feels like something of a rite of passage for those of us on the dating scene in the last few decades. In this case, however, our friend-of-a-friend makes a similar decision under much stranger conditions: she’s the tag-along girlfriend of a guy doing a six-month apprenticeship at an internet-famous bee farm, which happens to be thrumming with socialism and polyamory. We’re thrilled to bring you this tale of sex and chaos as our season finale!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By at least one measure, the Boston Red Sox of 2025 are doing just fine. They've outscored their opponents on the season, modestly, but at a better clip than that of, say, the Philadelphia Phillies, who are presently nine games over .500 and slotted into the final National League wild card spot. Their lineup has been impressive, notwithstanding the lingering hurt feelings of a thoroughly jerked-around Rafael Devers: Boston ranks in the top six among all teams in batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging, yes with certain indications of batted-ball luck but nothing that would cause a Bostonian to assert any more than their usual dispensation of God's particular favor. Devers has been excellent; Carlos Narváez, Jarren Duran, and Ceddanne Rafaela have been productive; Kristian Campbell, a rookie, has cooled off some but has still performed pretty admirably for one who appears to be a lanky child. Alex Bregman has been an absolute stud.
By other measures, the Sox are feeling some mid-summer pressure. They're presently three games below .500, and are nine games back of the New York Yankees in their division, and are eighth in the wild card race, closer to the bottom than to the promised land. If the Baltimore Orioles were not cursed dog-doo, the Red Sox would almost certainly be last in the American League East, which incidentally is where they finished in consecutive seasons before seeming to take a step forward with 81 wins in 2024. This is not really a roster constructed to contend for a World Series, but the Red Sox have now hit a point in their rebuilding project where they will need to show some definite signs of seriousness in order to prove that they are not just settled into a condition of mediocrity, or worse. A fourth-place finish and 76-odd wins will be hard to explain as anything other than a stall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cal "Big Dumper" Raleigh is an outlier in the obvious sense—he is the current MLB home run leader—but pile on the descriptive adjectives, and you wind up with an amalgam of three truths, all theoretically past their prime: Cal Raleigh is a switch-hitting catcher who plays for the Mariners. Somehow, he is still the current MLB home run leader by a not-insignificant margin of two, his 26 homers beating out names like Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani. Per traditional standards, he is slashing a very respectable .264/.370/.632. Throw in some adjusted metrics, and he has a 182 wRC+, which is to say 82-percent better than the average MLB hitter, which is to say, the second-best player in baseball, beating out names like Freddie Freeman and Shohei Ohtani. Raleigh has, so far, cared not for the underpinnings of modern baseball. Where to even start? Perhaps in iambic tetrameter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is the nature of a really good catch to make you feel like what you've just seen is the coolest thing ever to happen. That is how you know that what you've just seen is really good, and you can tell that you have seen something sufficiently cool if, for a moment, you find yourself reconsidering everything else you've seen. A great play should disorient you; a really great one will feel as if it was dropped on you from a great height.
There is a whole disordered way of being a sports fan that is built around following that natural instinct to reconsider everything all the way out, and into recursive madness; at every game you attend, there will be thousands of other people there whose relationship with sports amounts to constantly rearranging the faces on their own personal Mounts Rushmore and updating and itemizing a detailed personal taxonomy of Signature Moments. As a general rule, I think it is better not to be like that, and to just let the awe overtake you when and where it finds you. Not because it is smarter or more reasonable; no one cares about sports to become smarter or more reasonable. Just because it is more fun.]]></summary>
