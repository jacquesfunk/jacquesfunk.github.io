In the ALDS, a Carpenter from Florida saved the Tigers from a potential 0-2 series hole and promised them at least two more days of playoff baseball. The latter was more exciting; Jesus probably couldn't even make contact off Emmanuel Clase, while Kerry Carpenter uppercutted a two-strike slider deep into the right-field seats to break a scoreless tie in the ninth inning and deliver Detroit a 3-0 victory on Monday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's the nature of baseball economics that each offseason's record-breaking contract will wind up being surpassed; if it works out well enough, it might even come to seem like a deal. In this context, it maybe shouldn't register as a surprise that Bryce Harper, who made $26,050,000 in cash this season, seems like a bargain. His 13-year, $330 million contract, which contains no opt-outs, was the highlight of a 2019 offseason in which Phillies owner John Middleton said the team was prepared to “maybe even be a little bit stupid.” They weren’t; Harper is worth much more to the Phillies than they’re paying him.
The Phillies have been contenders in each of the last three years after almost a decade of being an afterthought. They won a pennant, with the deciding runs coming off a Harper homer in the bottom of the 8th of a clinching game. They won their first division title in 13 years this season. Harper won an MVP. There are other important players on the Phillies, but Harper is the one that has driven the team to its recent success.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being an NFL Draft nerd is fun but pessimistic work. It begins with the idea that most of the cool things you see happening in Baton Rouge or Columbus on Saturday are not things that ever can or will happen on Sunday. That isn’t an unreasonable way to go about eating tape: A perfectly blocked run in college football ends with a house call; a perfectly blocked run in the NFL probably means it’s second-and-6. But sometimes, in all the skepticism, you lose sight of the good stuff, especially so with guys like Jayden Daniels, who was mostly a pile of subordinate clauses in my mind before he ever made an NFL start. But he gets cartoonishly lit up all the time! But his pressure-to-sack ratio! But his age! I forget that there's supposed to be something on the first end of the sentence. 
Here are some complete and completely crazy sentences: The Washington Commanders offense works on Sundays. They are an absolute pleasure to watch. I believe they are going to score every time they take the field. Through the first four weeks of the season, no NFL offense was better at keeping drives alive. Against the Browns on Sunday—actually an iffy offensive performance by their own recent standards—the Commanders still dominated, 34-13. For the third straight week, they put up 30 or more points, and they did it this time against Cleveland's legit defense. (It didn't hurt that the Browns offense asks the defense to spend roughly 90 percent of each game on the field.) That Daniels had the worst game of his pro career, recorded his lowest completion percentage, and was pulled after the third quarter in Week 5 probably would not register as a concern to anyone familiar with the Commanders and their deal, historically speaking. That the rookie QB spent the entire fourth quarter on the bench because the Commanders led the Browns, 34-6, is an altogether different story.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After Jürgen Klopp departed Liverpool at the end of last season, new boss Arne Slot was faced with a doubly difficult task. Like any recently hired manager, he had to acclimate to a new club and a new set of players. What's more, he had to do all that under the colossal shadow of one of Liverpool's most beloved managers in its storied history. Even the most optimistic of Liverpool fans probably expected a slow, wonky start to the transition. Slot came into a great situation, about as good as any new manager could hope for, but it was still new, and the pressure would ramp up quickly.
A funny thing has happened two months into this season, though: Liverpool has not only been just as good as it was last season, it might even be better. At minimum, the Pool Boys haven't skipped a single beat, rolling out to eight wins in nine matches so far. That start has seen Liverpool top the Premier League table, win both of its two Champions League matches, and begin its League Cup title defense by trouncing West Ham. The only blemish came against a feisty Nottingham Forest on Sept. 14.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are so many plucky Teams of Destiny in this year's playoffs that it's hard to pick just one to win the World Series off the back of narrative power. But the San Diego Padres have one too many legitimately good players to qualify, and the Detroit Tigers lost their first game of the Division Series, so the odds, depending on how you're counting, might favor the alternately Francisco Lindor- and "OMG"-powered New York Mets.
It is never a detriment to be the overdog in a series, but a favored team will never have the whimsy inherent to a team that should be losing. The core of the Philadelphia Phillies this year remains the same core that fueled the himbo-led, "Oh dear God, please would you stop blogging about the" Phillies of 2022 and 2023; going down the rosters of each year reveals no real pivotal trades or signings that would explain in baseball terms how the atmosphere around the Phillies has changed so drastically. And yet the Phillies started out this year as the best team in baseball and ended the year not so far off the mark. Any reasonable fan would rather have a team like that over a team that pluckily plucks its way into the playoffs every so often. But something—even if just the illusion of zen—is lost in trading magic for expectation. There's no danger of collapse for the team that is just having fun out there, and no freedom from that danger for the team whose whole season will count as a failure if it doesn't advance.]]></summary>

They came to the Finals, they saw the Finals, and the Finals stood on their necks. They lost seven of the eight Finals games they played, and then they Dolaned up the next two decades. Seems harsh, true, until you look at their quick playoff exits. They won just enough to make you watch them, and then before you fully engaged, they disengaged.
But history is made for editing, and one thing the Liberty has never been is the indisputably best team in the league. (Well, that's maybe not true. They had the league's best record in 2015 and lost in the conference final to the team with the fifth-best record.)]]></summary>

As such, he was overcome with excitement. "I have to show everyone," he remembers thinking.
At a glance, the bodies of ctenophores, which are also called comb jellies, are shaped simply, like ovals. They have a mouth at one end and a concentrated sensory system called an apical organ at their rear. The small region of the apical organ contains "a photoreceptor or gravity receptor and some pressure receptor or chemical receptor," said Jokura, who is a ctenophore biologist at the National Institutes of Natural Sciences in Okazaki, Japan.]]></summary>

It was an unusually rich NFL Sunday, with two blocked field goal scoop 'n' scores and two hundred-yard defensive scores; Vanderbilt blocking Alabama's hat and its fans perpwalking the goalposts to Nashville's version of the sea; Miami ruining Cal's reinduction into college football's inner sanctum; Boise State's Ashton Jeanty rushing for 1,000 yards in only five games;  Kyler Murray celebrating a 50-yard touchdown run at the 45-yard-line; the goofy-ass Mets-Phillies series; and the New York Liberty getting closer to their first WNBA championship by putting the boot to the Las Vegas Aces with satisfied emphasis. And these are in no particular order; your own emotional mileage may vary.
They were also the decidedly lowjinks of Dolphins-Patriots, all three turgid hours of it, and the disaster that is Jets general manager Aaron Rodgers; Davante Adams in a stasis loop while the Raiders try to figure out the worst place to trade him; the NFL's new speed-concussion policy as it pertained to Justin Fields and Josh Allen (hint: their heads are still attached, so they're ready to go); the first inning of Tigers-Guardians; the megadisaster that is the Trent Dilfer apology/experiment at Alabama-Birmingham; and most depressingly the lightning storm in Pittsburgh that delayed Cowboys-Steelers but did not strike Elon Musk when he was right there for the frying.]]></summary>

The answers are not necessarily surprising.

Some of the people the Post spoke to left because they were sick of "the insults," which feels a bit like storming out of a steakhouse dinner just before dessert because you don't eat meat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you take the New York Jets aspect out of the thing, and then further strip a bunch of really crucial context from it, it is easy to see how Jets fans might have been optimistic about this season. The roster is as talented as any Jets team in recent memory, with the crew of Emotional Support Teammates that the team furnished Aaron Rodgers with last season mostly turned over in favor of more obviously NFL-grade contributors; Rodgers himself is as healthy as any 40-year-old NFL quarterback could be, which does not necessarily rise to the level of physical wellness traditionally associated with the word "healthy" but has mostly allowed him to stay on the field and intermittently do Aaron Rodgers-style football stuff; the defense, while depleted after some typically avant-garde front office maneuvering during the offseason, has the personnel to be good. In the abstract, the Jets are the sort of team that even reasonable fans could talk themselves into. In another, much more urgent, literal, and less abstracted sense, they remain the New York Jets.
That the Jets found a way to lose to the Minnesota Vikings in London on Sunday is less surprising with that in mind. The defense played its second straight excellent game, stymieing a Vikings offense that had been one of the NFL's best and effectively turning Sam Darnold back into the forlorn figure he was during his tenure with the Jets. But that Jetsian aura, a fragrant greenish fug in which all Jets games have been played for roughly the last decade and a half, affects everyone on the field. And on Sunday, even as the Jets defense succeeded in turning the game at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium into the unloveliest possible demonstration of American football, Aaron Rodgers was absolutely lost in it.]]></summary>

Before he transferred to Vanderbilt, he played at New Mexico State, and before that at the New Mexico Military Institute, where he committed out of high school as a two-star recruit. If there was any hint of what was to come, of the wild self-belief required to lead an upset of the No. 1 team in the country, it was that Pavia arrived in Nashville with a suspiciously rich lore. See: the no-look pass he once threw because his helmet was on completely backwards; the in-state rivalry taken so far it ended with an Albuquerque Journal story headlined “NMSU coach ‘disappointed’ in Diego Pavia after urination video”; the wrestling move he once tried on an Auburn defensive back, the only time I can remember a quarterback being called for unnecessary roughness. In that context and perhaps only in that context, Saturday’s Alabama-Vanderbilt game, a 40-35 Vandy win and maybe the biggest upset in SEC history, makes perfect sense. 
Pavia had plenty of things to say after the win; unfortunately for the SEC Network standards and practices department, about 40 percent of it would need to be bleeped out later. (“Vandy, we’re fucking turnt!” he shouted into the mic, moments after explaining that God had given him a vision of this as a little kid.) In the stadium postgame, Vanderbilt looped a quote from Nick Saban over the PA. Two weeks ago on the Pat McAfee show, the former Alabama coach said, “The only place you play in the SEC that’s not hard to play is Vanderbilt.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The moment at which an astute but otherwise objective observer might have begun getting suspicious about whether something might be going on with the New York Mets would probably have been late June. This was when it came out that the team had adopted as a clubhouse anthem the song that a reserve infielder had recorded in his home studio about being grateful and having a nice time. I can only guess at that perspective in this case, but take your own fan investments out of it and run this exercise through yourself. 
If you learned that, after wins, the baseball team you cared about was shouting along to the chorus of a song that the resident thirtysomething utility spork had recorded in his spare time—it could be Kevin Newman or Donovan Solano or whoever you like, in whatever genre you find most amusing to imagine—there would be in that news the sense that the good kind of weird thing was happening in that clubhouse. Any team that signed Jose Iglesias to a minor league deal, installed him as an everyday player out of necessity and watched him have the best season of his career at the age of 34, adopted his song, and then won nearly two out of every three games for four months would have some sense of destiny about it. It's simply too stupid not to mean something. The challenge has been believing that this could happen, and then accepting that it was indeed happening, to the New York Mets.]]></summary>

The muscadine is a grape, but not the kind that populates fruit salads and Ziploc baggies. Those are mushy, easily yielding to the teeth, tossed into the mouth and eaten whole. Instead, the muscadine is an imposing orb that forces the eater to meditate upon its structure. Its skin might be a dull green with a purplish blush, or a wine-dark purple with a pinkish blush; it might have a dusty metallic sheen. It might be rough and speckled on the surface, a little leathery, and strangely taut. If that doesn't sound like a pleasant bite of fruit, that's fine—you won't actually be eating that part.
