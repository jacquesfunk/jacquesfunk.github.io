        <link href="https://www.brandeating.com/2025/08/review-wendys-wednesday-meal-of-misfortune.html"/>
        <updated>2025-08-18T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wendy's Wednesday Meal of Misfortune is a meal themed after the Wednesday Netflix show. It includes 10 chicken nuggets (classic or spicy), two random mystery dipping sauces ("Dips of Dread" because they're spicy), small fries, and a small "Raven's Blood" Frosty.

The meal cost me $9.99.



The Wednesday Meal of Mistfortune is the same as a small 10-piece nuggets combo (which costs $9.79 at the same location), but with the new mystery dipping sauces and the new Frosty instead of a fountain drink.
The chicken nuggets were hot with a good crispiness and moist interior. I went with the classic version to better get a taste for the sauces.



I received a dark red sauce that looked like a berry sauce, but turned out to be a spicy ketchup (a spicy berry sauce would have been more interesting), and a greyish pink sauce that turned out to be a spicy mayo. Interestingly, the ketchup was slightly spicier, but both were medium in terms of heat. Flavorwise, there wasn't more than you typically get from ketchup or mayo. There wasn't any extra hit of seasonings or herbs. They went well enough with the nuggets and the fries.



The Raven's Blood Frosty is available with a Vanilla or Chocolate Frosty base and is swirled with a dark cherry sauce. It came with a themed purple spoon. I went with the chocolate but regretted it. It was fine when I ate some Chocolate Frosty by itself, and the cherry sauce by itself had an enjoyable sweet cherry flavor. However, eating the two together made my mouth unhappy. The combination just wasn't jiving. I think the chocolate was too mild, maybe.



Overall, Wendy's Wednesday Meal of Misfortune turned out nicely from a thematic standpoint. There was a special bag and all the food came in themed containers--even the stylized spoon came in a special wrapper. The new dips (I was only able to try two out of four, and they're given randomly), while interesting in terms of appearance, were less so in terms of taste.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taco Bell launches new Mountain Dew Baja Midnight as a permanent addition to its soda fountain.

The new, Taco Bell-exclusive soda flavor is purple with the taste of passion fruit mixed with the Mountain Dew Baja Blast (which is Mountain Dew plus tropical lime flavor). Like Mountain Dew Baja Blast, Mountain Dew Baja Midnight is available as a slush ice Freeze.
The suggested price for Mountain Dew Baja Midnight is $2.49 for a small, $2.79 for a medium, and $2.99 for a large.
The Mountain Dew Baja Midnight Freeze has a suggested price of $3.79 for a regular and $3.99 for a large. Like the fast-food chain's other Freeze and sodas, you can get a regular Freeze or a medium soda for $1 during Happier Hour, from 2 to 5PM, at participating locations.
On August 15, 2025, rewards members can get a free medium Mountain Dew Baja Midnight when spending $5 or more through the Taco Bell mobile app.

        <updated>2025-08-13T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[P.F. Chang's welcomes its new "Freakier Flavors" menu inspired by Disney's recently released Freakier Friday movie. Interestingly enough, the original Freaky Friday included a fictional House of Chiang restaurant (which sounds similar to P.F. Chang's), which the new menu pays tribute to.

P.F. Chang's new Freakier Friday-themed menu includes:


House of Chang's Spicy Chicken Dinner Special - Chang's Spicy Chicken served with white rice and an egg roll.
Mix It Up Mongolian Beef Dinner Special - Mongolian Beef served with white rice or lo mein and a house salad.
Switcheroo Refresher - Mango-orange lemonade that changes color and shimmers.
Crystal Ball Refresher - A mix of desert pear, lemonade, Sprite, and club soda that changes color and shimmers.
Pink Slip Ube Cheesecake - Vanilla cheesecake base topped with a creamy, nutty ube layer, made from purple sweet potato (ube), and topped with edible pink glitter.


The Freakier Flavors menu is available now for a limited time at most P.F. Chang's locations nationwide through September 2, 2025.

The deal can be redeemed by using the promo code "JUSTCRUSTUS" when ordering through the Little Caesars website or mobile app at participating locations nationwide (except Alaska and Hawaii).
Little Caesars' Crazy Crust is the chain's regular crust brushed at the edge with a buttery-flavored garlic spread and sprinkled with Parmesan (in the same manner as the chain's Crazy Bread).
A large, two-topping Crazy Crust Pizza is normally $11.99 at my local Little Caesars restaurant in Los Angeles.
