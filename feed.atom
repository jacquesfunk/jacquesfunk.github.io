        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At one point in time, Rory Dames was mostly known as a longtime women's soccer coach, leading the NWSL's Chicago Red Stars for about a decade as well as overseeing Chicago-area youth powerhouse Eclipse. But more recently, he's become known as a coach whom players repeatedly reported for emotional abuse and manipulation. Those reports by players did not immediately diminish Dames's power; he only resigned when those accounts began becoming public. The ensuing 234-page Yates report into systemic abuse across women's soccer included his name hundreds of times. 
U.S. Soccer, which oversees the U.S. Women's National Team as well as sanctioning the NWSL, suspended Dames's coaching license and, per USA Today, the federation reported him to the U.S. Center for SafeSport, the organization created by Congress to investigate sexual abuse across Olympic sports. SafeSport doesn't have any jurisdiction over the NWSL, but Dames's presence in the database still mattered, especially given his continued prominence in Chicago-area youth soccer. (The NWSL also banned Dames for life.) SafeSport opened an investigation into Dames, and anyone who searched its database would have found his name.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The news from Green Bay is this: Sam Darnold hasn't turned into San Darnold just yet, and the possibility that he actually isn't Sam Darnold anymore remains more than zero.
The phrase "Sam Darnold" here is meant as the pejorative everyone who pays attention to these things has always meant it to be, but the Darnold in this dimension continues to defy the common usage. He isn't the central reason the Minnesota Vikings have won their first four games, which puts them in approximately the 95th percentile of all NFL teams in the last decade, but he has been more than just "not an impediment." I mean, 4-0 is its own answer to any question you have.]]></summary>

In a video posted Saturday to both of their Instagram accounts, Barbosa is seen preparing to throw her bouquet. Saraiva's in the background, her heels exchanged for slides and a drink in hand. Her other hand is on her hip as she gazes toward the scrum ensuing over the tossed flowers. As the lucky recipient cheers and hugs Barbosa, Saraiva raises her glass, looks dead into the camera and smirks.
They captioned the video, "Enquanto umas caçam…" which roughly translates to "while some go hunting..."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is difficult to conjure a happier development for those addicted to low comedy than the phrase "Timberwolves-Knicks trade," so to them we bequeath the Friday night news that these two deeply and persistently weird franchises completed the most inexplicably timed big trade in recent league history. Put another way, while everyone else was doing their preseason media fun fairs, the Knicks and Pups were frantically scrubbing their rosters for wildly differing reasons. The Knicks needed a center because they had none, and the Wolves needed Julius Randle because how better to clog the traffic in front of Anthony Edwards?
Both teams seem to be on the rise, at least superficially, and positioned themselves to make a blockbuster deal each can claim unconvincingly puts them over the top. The Knicks get Karl-Anthony Towns, the beetle-browed post who has frustrated as much as he has entranced because he is capable of such grand levels of enchantment, and can complete the task of making this Jalen Brunson's team. The Wolves get some cash and cap relief and a player looking for a new contract who holds the ball enough to frustrate their newfound franchise face. The new blood on both ends suggests that Minnesota's conference finals appearance and the Knicks' continued slow boil are ready for enhancement.]]></summary>

Alabama, ranked fourth in the nation by people who are permitted to guess at such a thing and have their votes counted, was stomping Georgia, ranked second by those same people. Watched in person by High Lord Emeritus Saban and his consort Terry, plus the full ESPN panoply of hyperkinetic parrots called College GameDay, the Crimson Tide scored four touchdowns in 17 and a half minutes, along with forcing a safety and two turnovers, for a 30-7 halftime lead that also included this play from Ryan Williams, effectively spurring what we will be told was a massive national television audience of megatybillions to cry out at once, "What else is on?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The past Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix was a farewell for Daniel Ricciardo, but only in retrospect. Reporters had all but confirmed that Liam Lawson would receive a permanent seat at VCARB and Ricciardo's choked up post-race interview seemed to indicate a departure. But neither VCARB, or their owners at Red Bull, had released an official statement. So the day's send-offs took on a half-stated tone, none of which stemmed from his team—the commentators couched declarations about Ricciardo's final race with "likely" and "may." Kym Illman, a Formula 1 photographer and fellow Australian, posted a photo mentioning a "last goodbye hug." Fans voted him Driver of the Day.
VCARB only made the official announcement this Thursday. The outwardly unnecessary four-day delay to the announcement would have been distasteful even for the average driver; that a company of Red Bull's profile made such an oversight could be ascribed to the year's broadly self-inflicted dysfunction that has plagued the Red Bull higher-ups. An explanation does not change the travesty that Ricciardo, a boisterous fan-favorite, is somehow leaving the sport without similarly boisterous fanfare. Putting aside what respect a 13-year career in F1 may or may not demand in return, Ricciardo was the sort of personality that could bear such ceremony: some build-up, a video, an opportunity for other drivers on the grid to share fond memories or embarrassing stories.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CHICAGO — On Tuesday night, the Chicago White Sox had a shot at history, if not the kind any team sets out to make. At 36-120, they were just one loss away from breaking the record for futility since the MLB started scheduling this many games. Late September baseball contests, for two thirds of the league, tend to be either dubious searches for meaning or the barest excuse for drinking beer outside, but this one was played on the precipice of a loserdom that hasn’t been seen since the 19th century, when Cleveland had a 20-134 squad called the Spiders. In the 162-game universe, the White Sox were about to surpass the 1962 New York Mets, who finished their first season of existence at 42-120.
It wasn’t going to happen that night. The White Sox had their first late-inning comeback of the entire season, eking out a 3-2 victory over the visiting Los Angeles Angels. In normal terms, the Angels—at 63-94—are very bad as well. They were also the recipient of most of the home crowd’s scant goodwill on that night. When Angels’ second baseman Jack López hit a home run in the seventh to put L.A. up 2-0, Sox fans cheered him—a little too much. “The bleachers were getting real rowdy and people kept getting escorted out,” a friend who was at the game told me. “It felt like folks were ready to rage.” Earlier, fans had been chanting “sell the team” vigorously enough that the Sox-employed television broadcasters couldn’t really ignore it. When the Sox finished their improbable victory, improving their record when playing from behind after the seventh inning to a hilarious 1-94, the home fans booed them for it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bun Ito, a master's student at Tokyo Metropolitan University and Nagoya University, had begun rearing some Taiwanese tree frogs, greenish yellow amphibians each about the size of a lychee. The frogs, Kurixalus eiffingeri, live in the bamboo and broadleaf forests of Taiwan and parts of Japan, and raise their young in the small pools of water in tree hollows and bamboo stumps called phytotelmata. Ito was interested in the fact that parent frogs fed their tadpoles unfertilized eggs. But he noticed something strange. "I observed that the tadpoles were not defecating," he wrote in an email.
From the moment a Taiwanese tree frog hatches from an egg to the moment it metamorphoses into an adult frog, between 21 and 43 days later, it eats just like any other species of tadpole. But, unlike other tadpoles, it does not appear to poop. It excretes no solid waste whatsoever until a few days after it reaches adulthood. Ito and Okada recently described the remarkable feat of these tadpoles in the journal Ecology.]]></summary>

It was a final, fitting insult to fans of the Athletics, a team in the AL West that as of today used to play their home games in Oakland. Someone in the building, maybe only one single someone, had cause for celebration—not with the fans but at them.
With the future ripped away by John Fisher and the other owners who voted unanimously for this, what would the final major-league game on Oakland soil be like, I wondered? Would it be a party? A riot? How would the Oakland A's, an organization whose stated position to its own fans and the world at large for three years has been, more or less, We do not exist; do not regard us or our product, handle a sold-out crowd? It turns out that a fun funeral is still a funeral, and the energy that A's fans brought to the Coliseum served primarily to underscore the irrationality at the heart of the situation. They showed the baseball-watching world what the A's meant to them, while Fisher and his organization showed how little that mattered.]]></summary>

The criminal charges filed against Adams on Thursday account for only a strand in the web of corruption allegations that has covered his administration. There are many other characters in this saga, including Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Phil Banks, who is no stranger to scandals himself and had his home raided by the FBI this month.
He also doesn't know shit about the Knicks! Following today's unsealing of the indictment against Adams, Banks was approached on the street and asked for comment by NY1 reporter Kelly Mena. As a graduate of the Fetterman School Of Political Oafs, Banks attempted to defuse the situation by talking about the upcoming Knicks season.]]></summary>

The idea behind this one was to field a bunch of listener voicemails and do a quick whip-around the sports landscape first, and what it wound up being instead was a decently detailed talk about the NFL, the state of TV color commentary, and the trouble with processing something as unprecedented as Shohei Ohtani's most recent unprecedented season. And then eventually we get to the voicemails about cat poop. But it was a pretty thoughtful podcast for a while there!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wednesday night marked the second episode of the 47th season of Survivor—and with it, the end of an all-too-brief era. For a certain member of the chattering class, this season held the sort of promise not seen since Mike White nearly conquered that Fijian beach: a chance to watch a famous writer make a fool of themselves on national television. This year's media surrogate was none other than Pod Save America co-host Jon Lovett, a man whose list of former employers includes Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Aaron Sorkin. None of this impressed his tribe, who voted him out at the end of last week's premiere episode.
This week's elimination was arguably even more of an upset, but still, I found myself largely unmoved, if not bored. Some important context might be needed here: I'm not a Survivor superfan. I hesitate to even call myself a fan. Until last Wednesday, I'd watched exactly half of one season while high in an AirBnb in Burlington. If reality television is a spectrum, my tastes trend more towards docusoap (think Real Housewives, Wife Swap, Selling Sunset) than competition-based programming. It most likely comes down to the fact that I fundamentally do not understand the kind of person who would voluntarily spend weeks without running water. But what I do understand is podcasters—specifically the kind of podcaster that Lovett is. He's the sort that will say on national television, with an ain't-I-a-stinker face, "And now when people ask me what I do, I have to say that I'm a fucking podcast host."]]></summary>

Like the Open, there is a primetime segment that captures the audience at peak capacity—for AEW, that's the live airing of their show Dynamite from 8 to 10 p.m. But also like the U.S. Open, there is a lot left for those who stick around late into the night—a whole other tennis match, or, in AEW's case, a taping for one of their other TV obligations that stretches past midnight.
As such, when I leave Arthur Ashe, the atmosphere is different than the feeling leaving any other sports arena I've ever entered. The crowd is no longer a cohesive throng high on a win, crushed by a loss, or simply juiced from the action. It's more a collection of individuals thinking, We were the ones who cared enough to stick it out, and Oh god, when am I going to get to sleep?]]></summary>

The news broke Wednesday night and the indictment was unsealed Thursday morning; the full 57-page indictment can be read at the bottom of this blog.
This follows a series of FBI raids, subpoenas and resignations among the mayor's confidants and cabinet members for a growing web of investigations that, incredibly, may be about assorted corruptions entirely unrelated to today's indictment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sea robin begins its life looking like any other fish: a finned, larval speck drifting in the open ocean. As the sea robin grows, the pectoral fins on either side of its body widen like two unfurling fans—still fins, if a bit extravagant. But eventually the first three rays of each fin separate. They lose their webbing, tapering into slender structures that look remarkably like legs. When adult sea robins settle on the seafloor, where they will spend the rest of their lives, they use these "legs" to walk, stilt-like, the rest of their body hovering a few inches above the sand.
Corey Allard, a cell biologist and electrophysiologist at Harvard University, knew sea robins as the fish his dad and brothers frequently reeled in from the Atlantic. But he did not realize they had legs until he saw them at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. "Never looked that closely, I guess, nor expected a fish to have legs like that," Allard said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the arrival of NIL and the decision that college athletes deserve to be compensated for their work on the field, the NCAA, along with universities, have done everything they can to avoid responsibility for ensuring that compensation is distributed in a fair and orderly fashion. The last few years have constituted a desperate bid to maintain the illusion of amateurism, and in that desperation the NCAA and the schools have turned to boosters, NIL collectives, and corporate sponsors to keep the money flowing. As a result, NIL, while nice in theory, is deeply flawed and about as lawful and orderly as the old wild west.
Many of the problems with the current NIL system are now fully on display thanks to Matthew Sluka, the UNLV transfer who has been the starting quarterback for the Rebels during their hot 3-0 start. The team is expected to compete for the Mountain West title and now, thanks to the 12-team playoff, have a real chance at competing for the group of five slot in the bracket. Sluka, who had spent the four years prior as a dual-threat QB at FCS Holy Cross, claims that he was verbally promised $100,000 by a UNLV assistant coach to transfer over, but has only received a $3,000 relocation stipend. As a result, Sluka announced on Wednesday that he intends to redshirt and will not play for the remainder of the season.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, some of the most prominent figures in American broadcast news tried to get away with a staggering lie. The story is a particularly instructive case study on the dynamics of the American media's failure to accurately cover the ongoing Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza.
On Sept. 12, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced that her office would pursue criminal charges against students and alumni who protested the genocide by setting up an encampment on the University of Michigan's main quad. That protest launched on April 22, one day after Palestinian civil defense crews unearthed a mass grave containing 180 bodies at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Yunis. On May 21, university police moved against the protest in the early morning and cleared the encampment, pepper-spraying protestors in the process. Nessel's office filed misdemeanor trespassing charges against two of the protesters; the other seven face felony charges for "an additional count of Resisting or Obstructing a Police Officer," per the DA's office, for "making direct contact with the officers' bodies" while they were being arrested.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pittsburgh Pirates completed a painful bit of business Tuesday afternoon, designating journeyman first baseman and refrigerator-shaped fan favorite Rowdy Tellez for assignment, effectively ending his 2024 season. Tellez was in Pittsburgh on a one-year contract; in all probability, Tuesday's release brings to a close his days with the Pirates. The timing of this otherwise minor transaction is pretty icky: As first noted by Pirates fans on Twitter and then confirmed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Tellez was cut loose at the threshold of a performance bonus written into his incentive-laden contract. Tellez would've earned a $200,000 payout for hitting 425 plate appearances on the season; instead, after this last-minute maneuver, Tellez ends his campaign stuck on 421.
Ben Cherington, Pittsburgh's general manager, insists this is an unfortunate but otherwise pure coincidence. "Zero factor in the decision," Cherington said Tuesday, ahead of a game against the Brewers. "Aware of it, certainly. I’m aware of the contracts that all players have. No factor at all, zero." According to Cherington and Pirates manager Derek Shelton, the team wants to prioritize giving roster spots to the players who are most likely to factor beyond the end of this shitty, disheartening, last-place season. In related moves, the Pirates released veteran outfielder Michael A. Taylor, also wrapping up a one-year contract, and promoted a pair of minor leaguers into the big club's two fresh vacancies. One of these call-ups, 23-year-old Liover Peguero, is a gifted infielder with a somewhat faded prospect profile, the type of youngster that non-contenders traditionally do like to promote in September. The other, 29-year-old outfielder Joshua Palacios, is just a guy. Maybe one or both of them make the Pirates next season; for what it's worth, both of them have already seen time with the big club and played their way back to the minors.]]></summary>
