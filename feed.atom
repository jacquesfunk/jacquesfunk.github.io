        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The NBA is always getting taller, longer, springier, stronger. The league's future might lie in lithe titans like Victor Wembanyama and Evan Mobley. We now have the technology to imbue stick figures with strength, mobility, and guard skills. You'd be hard-pressed to identify an elite prospect under 6-foot-4. In such a world, the best player on the New York Knicks seems almost like an act of defiance. Small, dense, and inexorable, Jalen Brunson is a rock tumbling down a hill. He'll kick up off a tree root, squash a small weed, and get jostled by the changing curve of the slope. But he'll always create a path through any resistance.
I'm convinced that Brunson's official 6-foot-2 listing is one of the league's many fake measurements. He might land two inches shy of that, and has approximately the bodily proportions of a thumb. He doesn't get too high off the ground, and he doesn't run all that fast. What he does is weaponize what must be the lowest center of mass of any NBA star. He hunches over the ball, protecting it with the cave of his body, backing his way into the post. When he turns to face up, he'll use his shoulders to batter and dislodge his bigger opponents; where necessary, he will even use a noggin so big that his teammates wear colossal hats to mock it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The NBA's Western Conference is being weird right now. The two teams that made last year's conference finals—both younger teams thought to be on the rise—have now made themselves sharply worse with trades: The Timberwolves, by swapping Karl-Anthony Towns for a couple of grumpy and ill-fitting Knicks role-players; and now the Mavericks, by dumping the future of their franchise for a few post-prime* years of the broadly unreliable Anthony Davis. The Kings, Suns, and Warriors are in various states of crisis; the Nuggets are being hunted down by math; and the two Los Angeles teams are stalled out in also-ran-hood, pending unlikely runs of good health. Even the Spurs, who seemed a month ago to have arrived at feistiness ahead of schedule, are lately sagging back into lottery territory. 
*Here's a wild statistic, from Dan Devine of Yahoo Sports: Since Davis's arrival in Los Angeles in 2019, the Lakers have outscored opponents by just four total points in the nearly 4,600 minutes that Davis has played without LeBron James on the court beside him.]]></summary>

These are the questions Julia Cameron asks us to ponder in Week 4 of The Artist's Way in the form of reading deprivation.

We talked about how we each engaged with the challenge in our own ways—or not at all–in the latest iteration of The Artist's Way book club. If you're just joining us now, you can start from the beginning of the process here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The two seismic NBA trades that took place over the weekend involved four Western Conference teams scattered across the standings. What links the deals together is that they both represent, to different degrees, bets on Victor Wembanyama.
The San Antonio angle is more obvious, but let us first consider the temporal rejiggering aspect of the Luka Doncic–Anthony Davis turbodeal. One theory of the Mavericks' decision to trade the best player on a team that made the Finals eight months ago is that they would be better set up to win big this year with Davis, as old as he is, than with Doncic, as injured as he currently is. Dallas clearly peeked up the standings, saw a largely untested Oklahoma City team that struggles with size—I'd note this premise is flawed since Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein have yet to be healthy at the same time this season, but we are adopting the Nico Harrison position for this exercise, so—followed by the even more untested Rockets, a bizarro Grizzlies team that plays a Eurobasket style untested in the playoffs, the somewhat rickety Nuggets, and a bunch of teams with a bunch of old guys, and concluded that they could make a real run at contention right now. I don't think it's a stretch to think that Dallas also peeked down the standings and felt motivated to slam down the accelerator given the looming threat of Wembanyama, especially now that his Spurs are operating like a contender instead of a purpose-built lottery dweller.]]></summary>

Four news outlets—WWL Louisiana, The Guardian, the Associated Press, and The New York Times—fought for the release of emails between local Catholic leadership and the Saints. The emails were first obtained through a clergy abuse lawsuit brought against the archdiocese, but the Saints and the church wanted them kept private. The Saints and the church lost their court battle, and recently the four news outlets were finally given copies of the emails.
All four outlets wrote about what they discovered and published stories Monday; each report is worth your time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretty much right away, late on Saturday night when the Luka Doncic trade was first announced, I was convinced there had to be something wrong. Not just that I thought Shams was hacked—which I did—but even after we found out it was legit. Not to get all conspiracy-brained, but none of it passed the smell test, and it didn't help that various commentators seemed to have the same talking points explaining the trade, all of it revolving around Luka Doncic being so fat that when he sits down, he swallows the whole arena, or something. There is just no way to convince me that "conditioning" is why the Mavericks had to trade a 25-year-old superstar that just took them to the Finals last season. To that end, I would like to dissect some of the talking points.]]></summary>

Assuming politics in the league office work as they do in every other corporate structure, with credit flowing upward towards the Monopoly Guy reclining in the fattest chair, that would make Adam Silver a super-genius.
And credit where it’s due: it worked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friday afternoon saw the official announcement of the latest coup Saudi Arabia has struck against the traditional soccer establishment. Jhon Durán, Aston Villa's impossibly cool backup striker, is headed to Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr, which has acquired the Colombian's services for a reported transfer fee of €77 million. The move is just the latest escalation of an ongoing trend that has seen dozens of legitimately top-level talents eschew Europe's big leagues in favor of Saudi Arabia's big bucks. Like all those other moves, this one sucks ass.
The word "unprecedented" has already been attached to several previous transfers into the SPL, but it needs to be trotted out once again to describe the Durán move. This one's a lot like the Gabri Veiga transfer, only much, much more significant. Veiga was (and I guess still is?) a young prospect with genuine potential to one day reach the elite of the elite, but was not yet of serious interest to the top clubs as anything other than a flier. Durán, in contrast, has already gotten the big boys' tongues wagging. He's proven his scoring prowess in the best league in the world. He's played, and played well, in the Champions League. He's probably the single best U23 striker prospect in the world. West Ham and Chelsea both came close to signing him last summer, and his star has only risen since then. Aston Villa didn't hesitate to slap down the £57 million bid West Ham sent for Durán about a week ago, no doubt expecting that in a mere matter of months even bigger clubs—the likes of Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, and Barcelona have all reportedly been keeping a close eye on him—would come offering even bigger money. Anyone who pays attention to this stuff would've predicted that, by this time next year, Durán would have been either the face of Aston Villa's attack or the splashy new signing of one of Europe's perennial contenders. Veiga could've maybe, eventually gotten to where Durán is now, right on the doorstep of the soccer elite. And yet Durán, like Veiga, turned away.]]></summary>

I do not understand any of this and I am sure I never will. But that does not mean I don't like it.
Two years ago, Quebec meteorologist/rodent Fred la Marmotte was found dead on the morning of Groundhog Day; he had likely died the previous year. But organizers in Val-d’Espoir went along with the ceremony anyway, announcing “la mor du Fred” to the crowd right before he was to make his prediction. A new Fred made it to Feb. 2 this year and said we’d get six more weeks of winter, though the CBC reports that Canada's weather oracles were at odds: Lucy the Lobster, Shubenacadie Sam, and Fred agreed, but Wiarton Willie said we’d get an early spring. Soon, these predictions will cost 25 percent more.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This version of Manchester City must hate the entirety of North London. After losing 4-0 to Tottenham back in November, and the subsequent run of bad form that followed, City went into Arsenal's home ground on Sunday riding a bit of a high, relatively speaking. Though it had choked away a 2-0 lead to Paris Saint-Germain in the second-to-last Champions League league phase match, City has actually been on a bit of an upswing recently, winning six of its last eight matches across all competitions. In its most-recent match, a must-win against Club Brugge, City gave up the opener but ended up winning convincingly 3-1, thanks to a steady and ruthless second half. While I wouldn't have said that City is all the way back to its world-conquering ways, I wouldn't have been shocked if it went into North London and beat Arsenal, something it had done 12 times in a row in Premier League play between 2017 and 2023.
That being said, I am also not shocked at how the match actually went, as Arsenal played the most brutal of hosts—eat your heart out, Walder Frey—and stomped on City's slowly reanimating corpse to the tune of 5-1.]]></summary>

Even his makeup reflected the mood, with his face daubed to a dull flaxen hue instead of his typical defiant goldenrod. Whatever it was that Judge Juan Merchan was saying from his courtroom in New York during Donald Trump's sentencing that day faded into a dull whistling sound. When the time finally came for him to speak, Trump strung together the same phrases he has uttered every time the subject of his criminal history comes into question. He had suffered an "injustice," been through a "very terrible experience," before landing on one of his favorites: "It's been a political witch hunt." Persecuted and yet unbound, 10 days later the convicted felon was re-inaugurated to the most powerful political office on earth.
I've been thinking of this moment a lot in the last two weeks as Trump, or his cadres of sycophants and sympathetic oligarchs and associated corps of sunlight-deprived grifters, have set about dismantling the American project with the speed and enthusiasm of a contestant on Supermarket Sweep.]]></summary>

That’s a rather stupendous stat, considering that this annual round-robin affair for Europe’s top national rugby teams, which kicked off this weekend, dates all the way back to the nineteenth century.

Don’t be fooled by the final score: A pair of garbage-time tries from England covered up Ireland’s actual dominance.

It had been a sleepy start to the game, with both teams combining to hit a mere 23 shots and commit 19 fouls in the first half. Basheer Jihad kicked some life into the Sun Devils at the beginning of the second half with a pair of dunks and a three-pointer to grab a five-point lead. Alas, it was not meant to be. Caleb Love, last seen hitting a ridiculous half court three to force overtime on way to a win against Iowa State Monday night, led the comeback hitting multiple threes as the Wildcats went on a run.
Things were almost wrapped up with about 30 seconds left on the clock when Love was jawing with Arizona State's BJ Freeman under the hoop during an out of bounds play and, well, Freeman replied ... headfirst. Both were ejected, and Arizona State Coach Bobby Hurley yanked his team from the floor as the final buzzer sounded, bypassing the handshake line and customary pleasantries.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to Margin of Error, a politics column from Tom Scocca, editor of the Indignity newsletter, examining the apocalyptic politics, coverage, and consequences of Campaign 2024.
Everyone knows what Donald Trump is and what his administration is doing. Before he got up in front of the cameras and blamed the deadly midair collision between an Army helicopter and a passenger jet on diversity hiring, and before his vice president got up in front of those cameras and specifically argued that if a white person had contributed to the crash, it was because they were under the strain of working with unqualified minorities, there was his opening salvo of Jan. 6 pardons paired with the executive order denying the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship. And then the executive order calling trans identity a "falsehood" and saying it "is not consistent with the humility and selflessness" required for military service. And the executive order mandating "patriotic education" for primary and secondary schools built around the "celebration of America’s greatness and history." And the memo ordering the Department of Transportation to "give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average." And the unlawful and unconstitutional cutoff of federal grant spending, and the mass firing of the inspectors general, and the mass firing of the prosecutors who'd investigated Trump's previous apparent crimes, and—there was much more than that, and they've tacked on still more of it since the press conference, and anyone who claims to see anything in it other than intentional, comprehensive misrule by sadists and criminals and bigots is someone who is helping to bring it about.]]></summary>
