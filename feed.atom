While many libraries exist that mimic Rust's `Result`, I haven't seen any in this style. I think this library's approach is more simple and approachable, and I've already seen benefits when using it in my other projects.
Any feedback, PRs, etc is appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the news that everything was thinking about, Mercedes announced Thursday morning that Valtteri Bottas would be returning to the team as its reserve driver. Bottas spent the past three years as an unfortunate, i.e. racing for Alfa Romeo–turned–Kick Sauber, but up until 2021, Bottas had represented everything a championship-winning team needed in a second driver: fast enough to ensure 1-2 finishes, good enough in qualifying to occasionally beat Lewis Hamilton, not quite good enough to disrupt a clear 1-2 hierarchy. The full circle continues what has been considered one of the kinder arcs for a second driver post-eviction: freed from the pressure of one-year contracts and matching up against literally Lewis Hamilton, Bottas grew a mullet and a mustache, posted ass, and then managed to return to Mercedes with zero expectations.
If Sergio Pérez has half that, he will be fortunate. Red Bull announced yesterday that Pérez would be leaving the team after three seasons. Pérez is already missing out on the clean end-of-term-into-multi-year-contract-with-another-team sequence that Bottas got. Lest anyone forgets, Pérez's contract was initially due to expire at the end of the 2024 season, but six months ago, Red Bull Racing announced that they had extended his contract by two years. This was a baffling decision at face value, but could be explained by the disaster of Red Bull leadership, McLaren evading consideration as legitimate Constructors' Championship contender, Daniel Ricciardo still being in the second VCARB seat, and Pérez having a far worse second half of the season compared to his first—he had four podiums prior to the extension, and zero after. In the end, Red Bull had to worm its way out of an easily avoidable extension, and took a no doubt expensive route to an inevitable result; Sergio Pérez lasted for longer than expected, but he, too, fell victim to the curse of the second Red Bull seat.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, the urine tank on the International Space Station. In real time, I might add!
This uses the official live telemetry stream from Lightstreamer, although – at least at the moment – it doesn't eg. check what the signal status is so telemetry might be down altogether and you'd never know. Maybe in v0.2.
Native menu bar application, so it doesn't require running a copy of Chromium and Node to show you two emojis and a percentage.
I got the idea for this when somebody linked to https://iss-mimic.github.io/Mimic/ joking about how we can see in real time how full the urine tank on the ISS is; after I understood that there's a public live telemetry stream I knew in my heart I had to do something very silly with it. I've also finally been learning Swift and macOS programming in general and I figured this'd be an excellent first Swift project, so here we all are.
Just as an aside, the "ISS Mimic" project itself is very interesting and worth checking out (https://github.com/ISS-Mimic/Mimic). I'm in no way, shape or form affiliated with them and they have no idea who I am.

As it's written using modern ES features and due to its isomorphic nature, it can be run in both browsers and runtimes (Node, Deno, Bun) without any changes.
This makes it ideal for client-side and server-side rendering, as well as static site generation, whichever environment you prefer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN community, happy Thursday!
I’m excited to share something I’ve been working on over the past few weeks: Thumbly.
You’ve probably seen those dynamic social media thumbnails when you share a GitHub repository on Twitter or other social media. Thumbly can bring that same functionality to your website.
With Thumbly, you can generate dynamic social media thumbnails for every page of your site. These thumbnails can automatically change based on the parameters you set, so each page has its own unique design. No need to manually create or upload different thumbnails every time you publish new content.
I originally built Thumbly for one of my own side projects because I wanted dynamic, GitHub-style thumbnails for social media shares. I’d love to share it with others who might find it useful. So this is basically a side-project of a side-project.
There’s no signup page yet, but feel free to reach out to me via email. I’ll be happy to help you integrate Thumbly into your website or even set it up on your own server.
I’m actively using Thumbly myself, so I’ll continue to improve and add features. Your feedback and ideas would mean a lot as I refine it!
And if you are not happy with the pricing, I'd be happy to discuss something that fit your requirements and site's workload.

ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.
As doctors navigate risks of criminal prosecution in states with abortion bans, hospital leaders and lawyers have left them to fend for themselves with minimal guidance and, at times, have remained “conspicuously and deliberately silent,” according to a 29-page report released Thursday by Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden. The poor direction is leading to delays in emergency care for patients facing pregnancy complications, the report concluded.

Planship [1] provides guardrails and tooling for SaaS plan packaging, dimensions, entitlements, metering, enterprise onboarding/provisioning, upsell logic, experimentation, and other related tasks.
Planship allows for the creation of levers (AKA pricing dimensions) and specific lever values (“Entitlements”), which are then grouped together within plans (AKA packages, tiers, Stripe “products”, etc.) that customers and teams subscribe to. Entitlements can be feature-based, usage-based, seat-based, or any combination of models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was an eventful year for our award's namesake. Shams Charania's mentor-turned-rival Adrian Wojnarowski left ESPN in September to take a job in college basketball. Just three weeks later, Charania left The Athletic and assumed Woj's place as "Senior NBA Insider." This was perhaps always his destiny, since he was a news-breaking teenage prodigy: to speak his beautiful sentences on linear TV, to appear in a little photo inset for news graphics. In November, Charania was granted an award for basketball writing besides ours: first place in the Professional Basketball Writers Association's 2024 Blumenthal Memorial Writing Contest, for his co-bylined work with The Athletic's Jon Krawczynski. If any of the other awardees are reading this post, please reach out: We're curious to know what it's like to learn that you have won an award for good writing, and then, within the same sentence, learn that Shams Charania has also won it.
It is momentous to present the Shamsy in this strange year of "artificial intelligence." Sometimes critics compare the scoopster prose style to the output of a large language model; I find this funny, but off the mark. While often factually wrong and semantically hollow, an LLM's sentences typically scan like sentences that real humans might produce. Perhaps lazy or thoughtless humans trying to cheat on their homework, but real ones. These models are, after all, trained on a huge corpus of human writing. But the compositions of Shamsy award winners are compelling precisely because they deviate from default human rhythms. Man has not yet devised an intelligence that can report a Jarred Vanderbilt injury in such a disorienting fashion. For now, the human mind is more flavorfully stupid than its technological successors. That's what makes these nominees some of the most innovative writers working today, and that's why we're grateful to sift through these submissions.]]></summary>

Quote of the Week
 

"Intimate betrayal most often occurs when partners violate their deeper values to gain a temporary sense of empowerment."
- Steven Stosny
Betrayal
Ari Tuckman’s survey of ‘mixed’ ADHD relationships suggests there are a lot of affairs in ADHD-impacted relationships.  I’m not surprised by this.  While some people are just serial non-monogamists or thrill seekers, many of the affairs I see in my work have to do with power-imbalances and that is just really, really common in couples impacted by ADHD.

It’s Thomastag, or Thomas Day, in remembrance of the Apostle Thomas, who doubted the resurrection of Christ the longest and was the last disciple to “move out of the darkness.”

Grossarl is an historic market town in the Tyrolean Alps encircled by working dairy farms and mountain meadows. In recent years, it’s become a destination for winter sports and its traditional Advent market. On this particular morning, a band of colorfully costumed locals is lining up in the semi-darkness to embark on a seven-and-a-half-mile journey across its snowy hillsides that will last until sunset.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ernie Adams was a gearhead from an early age. As a child, he would attach junkyard motors to bicycles and wagons to make running vehicles. In 1962, he came up with the idea of building miniature versions of real cars. By 1965, he was able to build a working scaled-down 1928 Chevy two-door sedan made out of nine old refrigerators and powered by a two-cylinder, 13-horsepower Onan motor.

Since then, Adams has built countless 11/16th scale model cars, all of them street-legal and complete with windshield wipers, air conditioning, and radios. In 1979, he ventured into race cars, participating in the first dwarf car race at the 1983 Yavapai County Fair. Before his recent retirement from building cars due to old age, he ventured into building classic touring cars.

Adams and his family, who are originally from Harvard, Nebraska, now operate a museum on their Arizona property showcasing some of his work. He often hangs out at the museum. On site, one can view a short film and book explaining how he creates his vehicles. One can also see his workshop and other cars and related memorabilia he has collected.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marko here from Codaxy. For over two years, we have been working on CxReports, a low-code tool for creating user-facing PDF documents and reports.
We first saw the problem in wealth management, where reports are crucial for the user experience. Software vendors have customers who ask for customized reports with unique content, branding, and visuals. The solution was to build a tool that allows customization for each customer, which even customers themselves can use. Over time, this evolved to be a generic solution that works for various other use cases.
CxReports lets you build reports visually. You can connect to a database and get data using SQL queries. It supports scheduled report generation and delivery. The API enables accessing CxReports from other applications or workflows.
You can easily try it out with our Docker image -
https://docs.cx-reports.com/getting-started/docker/.
We offer a free tier for registered users.
https://cx-reports.com/
How do you currently handle customized reporting? Are there specific challenges you face with generating user-facing reports? I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback.
Looking forward to the discussion!

Here’s my attempt at dethroning the chokehold that festive Pillsbury sugar cookies have on me
 For me and many other Americans who grew up on Pillsbury cookie dough, it’s not officially the holidays until I’ve had my share of sugar cookies printed with reindeer, Christmas trees, and snowmen. These presliced sugar cookies have been the nostalgic flavor of December for as long as I can remember, and the printed designs only add to the whimsy.
It got me thinking: How hard could it be to replicate these fanciful cookies from scratch? I’ve only ever attempted slice-and-bake cookies once before, when I was in middle school, and my lack of patience with chilling the dough led to a puddle of butter and sugar in my baking tray. Could I redeem myself with an impressive sug…]]></summary>

Don’t want to fry a mountain of potatoes for Hanukkah? These frozen latkes have got you covered. 
 I’m a pretty stubborn latke cook. Even well into a Hanukkah party, when others have graciously offered to step in on the stove or told me there are, in fact, already enough latkes to feed an army of Macabees, I persevere at my task. Call me a perfectionist. Call me a kvetcher. But I have a lot of opinions about making latkes and I’ll see them through. 
I understand that not everyone shares that passion. And I get that frying a batch of latkes can leave your home smelling like grease and onions for weeks (a Hanukkah miracle!) and create a heck of a mess. For anyone who prefers not to fry their own latkes, there are — a welcome surprise to me — some great, pre-cooked optio…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s the perfect snack, martini garnish, and girl dinner star. Now, the mighty olive takes candle form for the 14th day of the Eater Advent Calendar.
 


I love big, non-candle-shaped candles as much as the next person — but, as a dirty martini-lover, I especially love it when they’re shaped like fist-sized olives. Nata Concept Store has taken our cultural obsession with aperitivo snacks of late (is tinned fish and cheese still “girl dinner”?) to new heights with its very White Elephant-worthy food-shaped candles, and this giant cocktail olive has my vote for so many reasons. Not only would it look delightful surrounded by a moat of artichoke dip, but the modest 2-inch height makes it ideal for dinner parties, as it won’t obstruct the views of your guests. I also appreciate that its rounded shape will help it burn without falling and spilling all over the place like some other non-candle-shaped candles I have purchased (to those wondering, butt-shaped candles are best left un-burnt). Most importantly, of course, it pays homage to one of my favorite savory snacks. 



No peeking! But check out what the Eater Advent Calendar has already revealed.  And check back each day for a new clutch condiment, gadget, or nibble that, yes, makes an amazing gift — but these surprises are just for you.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN,
I've recently been trying out and using the latest and greatest software development agents, including Windsurf and Cursor.
Before using those, I had been using aider for everyday practical SWE tasks, but aider is not very agentic --it's best at one-off, scoped programming tasks.
I did a quick test by putting aider in a ReAct loop using create_react_agent from langchain. To my surprise, it ended up working very well --it's able to solve programming tasks that Windsurf has failed at.
The agent has access to many tools such as ripgrep, fuzzy find, filesystem navigation, etc. One tool, in particular, is an expert tool where it can use a dedicated reasoning model, such as OpenAI's o1, to reason about logic, bugs, or complex planning tasks. It's been really interesting to see when and how it decides to use these tools.
The project does support plugging in any model you want to use, but so far I've found it to work best with the latest claude as the agent, and o1-preview (or o1 if you have access to it) for the expert reasoning model.
This is something I put together out of practical need, so if you have ideas, feedback, or especially PRs, those are welcome.
The project is licensed as Apache 2.0 (same as aider) and is intended to be a public good --our open tool so we aren't all dependent on proprietary tools and services to get our work done. The dream is that it will eventually work well on fully open/local models.
Cheers

clear that whenever our country experiences progress and growth in the field of

You don’t have to do the most or spend the most, but you do have to make some effort
 Before the pandemic, I didn’t cook for other people too often. It was easy to make excuses. Namely, it’s hard to fit people in my apartment for a dinner party; why not just go out to dinner? As we began to ease back into socialization though, not everyone I wanted to see was on the same page about dining out. Yet they, like me, were stymied by various logistical constraints when it came to dinner parties — not having a table big enough to seat everyone, or not having the desire to both offer up their space and cook.
Potlucks, then, emerged as a happy medium: Someone would volunteer their space, the rest of us would bring food, and ever…]]></summary>

- I maintain it as code with auto-generating visualization
- The map updates live as our community contributes
- Anyone can contribute in minutes

The goal is to help devs choose the right tools and plan their AI infrastructure while the community maintains the most current view of the ecosystem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Vyne, a grand Tudor mansion, is steeped in history and intrigue. Its elegant architecture, exquisite gardens, and fascinating artifacts offer a glimpse into the lives of its former inhabitants. However, within its historied walls is an intriguing ring wrapped in a story of gods, curses, and theft, a ring that some claim was an inspiration for one of the most iconic objects in literature. 

Known as the Ring of Senicianus (or the Ring of Silvianus), the gold ring dates back to fourth-century Roman Britain and was discovered in 1785 by a farmer plowing a field near Silchester. The ring is inscribed with the Latin phrase "SENICIANE VIVAS IIN DE," which, is believed to be a misspelled and cropped transcription of "Senicianus vivas in Deo," meaning "Senicianus lives well in God."

I got frustrated with YouTube constantly forcing dubbed audio tracks on me. Since there's no built-in option to default to original audio, I built a Chrome extension to solve this. It automatically switches any video to its original audio track, no matter where you are. No setup needed - just install and forget it.
This is perfect if you're tired of YouTube pushing dubbed content on you.
Try it out: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/youtube-original-au...
I would love to hear your feedback!

Under the hood, it uses GPT to generate gift ideas then search for products. Right now, it’s integrated with Amazon, but I’m exploring adding more platforms and refining the personalization to assist better.
I started this as a fun side project after struggling to find thoughtful gifts myself. It’s helped my friends to get perfect ideas, but I’d love feedback from the HN community:
Does it solve a problem you care about? Any ideas for features or improvements?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rafting through the Cañon del Güejar means traversing through 500 million-year-old rock formations amid the Sierra de la Macarena (Macarena Mountain Range), one of the world’s most biodiverse areas. It is part of the Guiana Shield, an ancient geological formation that spans parts of Colombia, Brazil, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and southern Venezuela. It is a ride through archaic landscapes, primeval forests, and the cascading waterfalls of the Rio Güejar (Güejar river).  

The region is relatively new to tourism. Until about 10 years ago, it was controlled by FARC guerillas and classified as a “red zone” conflict area, one of the most dangerous areas in the country. Now it’s attracting adventure tourists looking to experience the natural beauty of Colombia’s more remote topography. Since it is also a wildlife refuge surrounded by national parks, prepare for an abundance of animal sightings including bears, otters, and a variety of bird species. One of the notable landmarks is the El Cerro del Indio Acostado, an ancient rock formation that looks like a man’s profile and is beloved by locals. 

During the rafting experience, there are myriad opportunities to bathe in waterfalls and swim in the crystalline waters of the Rio Güejar in between navigating the gushing rapids. Don’t rush to leave the region after the rafting adventure because there’s a variety of nature activities to fully immerse yourself in, like tubing, horseback riding, and hiking; all of which support the local families who are building tourism options in their communities.]]></summary>

I built Transcrib.ee to help me generate transcripts for lectures on YouTube with no captions, especially multilingual lectures. I was constantly frustrated with videos that had no transcripts or inaccurate ones, so I built a tool and decided to share it with everyone.
This tool uses Groq (an AI inference engine that's different from Grok and offers very fast processing) and OpenAI's Whisper model (really accurate in multilingual) to quickly transcribe any YouTube video, regardless of the language. It's been a game-changer for my studies!
To make it even faster, I created a Chrome extension that lets you get transcripts using a keyboard shortcut or directly from the YouTube video player by clicking the Transcrib.ee button. I hope it helps you too! Try it out and let me know what you think: https://www.transcrib.ee/

I built a simple accessibility widget, which can be embedded on any website for free. 
No signup required, just a line of (defer) code to copy & paste.
It'll not slow your website down, and once installed, there's a blue accessibility icon fixed to the lower right side of the screen, what can it do?
* highlight links and headers
* pause all animations
* increase font size
* change contract
* hide images
* and more!
Any feedback would be great, maybe you miss a feature? Looking forward to your thoughts!
Thanks,
Simon

It's a set of tools that have allowed me to prototype quickly small (and increasingly bigger) kernels, and create userspace programs to interact with them.
Supports riscv64, amd64 and i386. The intel port has been tested and used on real hardware, from big dual-socket Xeon machines to an old X220.
It is all C, I have plan to make rust bindings for the kernel library. But again, they're plans at this stage.
Porting to new architectures is relatively simple, a basic port to riscv took me a couple of weeks of spare-time hacking.
While still at early stage, has now reached the point where I believe it can be useful to more people than just me.
Let me know what you think :-)

The fans were almost all Black, as is the student body at the county’s lone public high school. Scanning the field and the stands would give you little indication that more than half the county’s residents are white. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN!
After 6 years of R&D, our small team is excited to share our project TideCloak - an IAM designed to help developers move fast without worrying about catastrophic breaches or overpowered admins with keys to the kingdom.
Traditional IAMs rely on centralized authority - admins, root certificates, and decryption keys - which create glaring vulnerabilities in a breach. To address this, we’ve integrated Keycloak (Red Hat’s IAM) with a decentralized key architecture powered by our (academically validated) Ineffable Cryptography.
Here’s the idea: keys are split across a decentralized network (our Cybersecurity Fabric) so no one ever holds the full key. Even in a breach or F$%k up, there’s no unchecked authority exposed.
Right now, TideCloak uses the Cybersecurity Fabric as an IdP, meaning users authenticate without their credentials being stored or shared. Essentially, users bring their own authority - without needing to trust anyone else to keep it safe.
Coming soon:
- Identity Governance Administration to prevent super admin abuse.
- User-sovereign digital assets, where assets are secured with unique decentralized keys to protect against mass breaches.
We’ve just launched a free developer sandbox, and we’d love your feedback:
https://github.com/tide-foundation/tidecloak-gettingstarted
It’s still early stages, and your input will help us improve.
Thanks for taking a look - ask us anything!

The women were having miscarriages. They were bleeding and in pain.
They needed a medical procedure to clear their uterus, but their doctors delayed it or didn’t even counsel them about it. Our yearlong investigation found that abortion laws are affecting how physicians treat pregnancy loss and other complications because the procedures used in these cases are also used for abortions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RAGLite is a Python package for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.
RAG applications can be magical when they work well, but anyone who has built one knows how much the output quality depends on the quality of retrieval and augmentation.
With RAGLite, we set out to unhobble RAG by mapping out all of its subproblems and implementing the best solutions to those subproblems. For example, RAGLite solves the chunking problem by partitioning documents in provably optimal level 4 semantic chunks. Another unique contribution is its optimal closed-form linear query adapter based on the solution to an orthogonal Procrustes problem. Check out the README for more features.
We'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions, and are happy to answer any questions!

  - Remembers current position - continue where you stopped reading on any device
  - Share PDFs with an external audience via a link or a QR Code. Shared PDFs can be access controlled
  - Dark Mode, colored themes and custom theme colors
  - Inverted color mode for reading PDFs
  - SSO support via OIDC

  - view PDFs seamlessly in the browser of my desktop and mobile devices
  - every user can upload files
  - can be self-hosted via Docker
  - minimal and resource-friendly
  - SSO support

  - They are using the inbuilt PDF viewer of the browser. This works fine on desktops and laptops but on smartphones it will simply download the PDF file and not display it in the browser.
  - They are really feature rich and therefore resource-hungry. I did not need fancy AI or OCR. I just wanted to view and organize my PDFs.
  - The content needs to be curated by an admin user. Normal users are not allowed to add PDFs.
  - PDFs can not be uploaded via the UI. PDFs can not be uploaded via the UI.

The idea came from my own struggles keeping track of trip details—flights, itineraries, places I wanted to visit, and even the random thoughts I had along the way. Nothing out there felt personal enough or flexible enough, so I decided to build it myself.
What makes Voyalog different is how laid-back and flexible it is. It doesn’t try to control every aspect of your trip. You can use it to plan as much or as little as you want. It’s also a super clean way to keep your photos and attachments organized, with free cloud storage included.
As a digital nomad and solo developer, I’ve put my heart into this. I’d love to hear your thoughts—whether you find it helpful, see areas for improvement, or even if it’s something you’d actually use. I have plenty of ideas to expand and improve the app, but first, I want to make sure it truly resonates and makes sense for others.
For me, the coolest part is how easy it makes reliving your trips. Like instantly pulling up a photo of the amazing ramen you had in Tokyo months ago, instead of digging through thousands of random pictures.
The app doesn't even require an account, so you can use it right away. It's only available on Android at the moment.
If this sounds interesting, I’d love for you to try it and let me know what you think. Any feedback is appreciated! You can download it from here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.voyalog.ap...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joe Otterson, reporting for Variety:
“Silo” has been renewed for both Seasons 3 and 4 at Apple TV+,
with the fourth season set to be the show’s last.
The renewal news comes as the post-apocalyptic drama is currently
airing its second season. The sixth episode of Season 2 is due out
on Dec. 20. The season finale is scheduled to debut on Jan. 17.
I feel bad complaining about a good show not only getting renewed, but renewed through to a planned conclusion. I fucking hate when good shows get cancelled after one season.
But. While I really liked season 1 of Silo, season 2 has been a bore. We’re halfway through — five episodes — and everything interesting could have been put in one episode. Maybe one and half. I hope the remaining five episodes of season 2 pick up, but so far, it really feels like this entire season has just padding to get to what’s next. Hugely disappointing, really.

I originally built Magic Message Santa for my kids. They wrote Santa a letter with their Christmas wishes (like we've all done in the past) and I thought, “What if we could send Santa a voice note instead? How cool would that be!”
I knew AI was great at transcribing voice notes, but I wasn’t sure if voice generation was there yet. After some initial testing, we were genuinely amazed by the results, it felt like magic! So, I named it and opened it up to the public.
Hope you and your kids enjoy the experience as much as we do!
Would love to hear your thoughts or answer any questions you might have. Have a Merry Christmas!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I built Habit Rewards, a habit tracker app designed to make building habits more enjoyable through gamification and a clean, minimalist design.
The app allows you to:
- Track daily/weekly/monthly habits.
- Earn virtual coins for completing habits.
- Set personalized rewards for achieving goals.
- View progress through beautiful tile-based grids
- Mark habits as failed intentionally, so the tracking remains realistic.
The goal was to create something simple but engaging to help with consistency. It's built with FlutterFlow and Firebase, and the app is live on the App Store.
I’d appreciate any feedback or thoughts, especially if you’ve worked on similar projects or have ideas to improve it.
Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN!
I wanted to share Yakari, a tool I built to make command-line interfaces more approachable through interactive TUIs. If you've ever forgotten CLI flags or needed to look up command syntax, this might help.
Yakari turns complex commands into interactive menus. Users can navigate through options with simple key presses instead of memorizing complex command structures. If you've used Emacs and Magit (or any other Transient) before, the interface will feel familiar.
Features:
- Transform CLIs into guided menus
- Create custom menus for any CLI
- Support for flags, named parameters, choices, and interactive inputs
- Command history and contextual help
You can try it out without installing thanks to uv [1]:
  uvx --from yakari ykr demo # Play with a demo showcasing different argument types
  uvx --from yakari ykr git  # Try the git menu in any git repo

I'd love feedback from both CLI users and developers. What tools would you find most useful to have menus for? How could this make your terminal workflows easier?

It sure is old, having been established in 1654 by a Levantine Jew from Syria named Cirques Jobson, though it has only been located on the present site since (circa) 1970.

There is another claimant to the title in Oxford, the Grand Café on High Street, which was originally founded in 1650, a coffee house opened by a Jewish entrepreneur named Jacob. It is Europe's oldest in that aspect, but technically speaking, it has not continually been a coffee house throughout its history unlike the Queen's Lane Coffee House.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Through the city of Sendai runs the Hirose River. It has several stream pools along its course, one of which is known as Kashikobuchi, or the Wise Abyss, and there is a chilling legend that accounts for its name.

Once upon a time, a local man was fishing by this stream pool when he found a gossamer thread tied around his ankle. Finding it strange, the man undid it and instead tied it around the trunk of a nearby willow tree. The same thing happened over and over again, until the tree got dragged into the water with a loud noise. Dumbfounded, the man stood there watching the ripples spread on the surface of the river.

Out of the silence that followed, an ominous voice was heard saying "Kashikoi, kashikoi "(Very wise, very wise). Then the man finally saw what lurked underneath the water: a monstrous spider that reigned over the area, preying on unsuspecting villagers.

Interestingly, the same spider makes an appearance in another folk tale of Sendai. In this legend, a large eel that lived in the downstream called on another villager to aid him in a fight with the spider, asking him to stand by as a witness and not to make a sound. The next evening, the villager came to see the eel and the spider fighting, and could not help but scream in terror. This caused the eel to lose the battle, and all the villager saw was its severed head glaring at him from the water, before losing his mind and dying.

The Spider of Kashikobuchi was both feared and worshipped by the villagers, who regarded him as a god of trade and protector against floods. Today, a largely neglected stele in the thicket by National Route 48—overlooking the Kashikobuchi pool, no less—serves as the only testament to this spider god, here referred to as Myōhō-gumo-no-rei, or the Ghost of the Mystic Spider.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Masumoto Family Farm is a fourth-generation Japanese-American farm outside of Fresno, California, run by David “Mas” Masumoto and his daughter, Nikiko. The family focuses on growing heirloom stone fruits and grapes, steered by their belief that, above all else, fruit should taste amazing. That seems like an obvious goal, but in the modern market, durability and appearance have long trumped flavor in the produce aisles. So by growing delicious heirloom varieties, the Masumotos are making a radical choice. And with no guaranteed commercial buyers, they often have to rely on equally radical systems to sell their fruit. That’s why, 20 years ago, Mas decided to tread new ground to save the Elberta peach—an almost-extinct heirloom stone fruit—by creating his Adopt-a-Tree Program.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This museum's primary focus is on musical instruments that represent the diverse musical traditions of Morocco and the surrounding region. Visitors can examine a comprehensive collection of musical instruments from various ethnic and cultural groups. The displays provide context about the historical significance, construction techniques, and cultural importance of these musical artifacts.

Traditional Moroccan music is classified by its kaleidoscopic regional variations. Among the most common styles are Amazigh, Andalusi, malhun, chaabi, aita, reggada, gnawa, and guedra. Each of these styles is associated with specific ethnic groups and musical instruments. Made of locally available resources and at times with hard-to-come-by materials, these instruments required is astonishing level of artisanship.  

Architecturally, the museum preserves the splendor of a traditional Moroccan palace, with its beautiful inner courtyard and elaborately decorated rooms serving as an exceptional setting for the musical instrument exhibits. The space itself tells a story of cultural refinement, with each room carefully designed to complement the musical displays and provide visitors with an immersive experience of Morocco's musical heritage.

An inscription unearthed in the reception room attests that the building was constructed in 1882. The original owner of this palace was Ben Larbi Jamai, Grand Vizier of Sultan Moulay Hassan I. In 1912, the French authorities repurposed this building to serve as a military hospital, and a few years later, in 1920, the palace was officially recognized as a historical monument. The same year, the Museum of Indigenous Arts was opened on its premises.  Since then, the theme of the museum has undergone several transformations, and in 2014, it eventually became the National Museum of Music.]]></summary>

Watson and Ozy Media were both convicted in July of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. 
Last year Watson was indicted after New York Times reporting revealed that former Ozy Media Chief Operating Officer Samir Rao impersonated a YouTube executive on a conference call with Goldman Sachs. Both Watson and Ozy were indicted, and both pleaded not guilty throughout the trial, with Watson claiming instead that the entire trial was racially motivated, biased, and corrupt. He and his team raised more than $60,000 since March 2023 on this argument through a website titled “Too Black for Business,” and last month, supporters released a two-part, three-hour docuseries on YouTube called “The Troubling Case of Carlos Watson.”]]></summary>

Classic saimin noodle soup at a beloved diner chain, top-tier fish at the best new omakase in town, ceviche tostadas at a chill BYOB spot, and more of Honolulu’s best meals
 Outside interests have made money in Hawai‘i for centuries, including in food. Waves of restaurateurs from the continental U.S. and abroad have opened restaurants in Honolulu, with everyone from Japanese conglomerates to Michael Mina setting up shop. But simultaneously, Honolulu’s homegrown businesses have been able to ride waves of excitement to expand themselves. In the last decade, tiny mom-and-pop restaurants have opened second locations, while established local chains expanded their reach. More and more chefs have worked to learn about Hawai‘i’s history and culture to respectfully incorporate aspects into their restaurants. That is to say, diners in Honolulu are a bit spoiled for choice.
Updated, December 2024:
The winter tourist season has descended on Honolulu, and with holiday festivities in full swing, comfort foods and neighborhood stalwarts like the homey spot Moké’s Bread and Breakfast are the draw. Despite the generally warm weather, Honolulu is a soup town, and the slight dip in temperatures this time of year has people turning to only-in-Hawai‘i noodles at Palace Saimin, around since the mid-century, and clear, restorative bowls at Phở Tô Châu, an anchor in Honolulu’s Chinatown.
Eater updates this list quarterly to make sure it reflects the ever-changing Honolulu dining scene.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN,
I’m excited to share Bodo, an open-source compute engine designed for large-scale data processing in native Python. Bodo is powered by an auto-parallelizing JIT compiler and an HPC backend, enabling it to generate highly optimized, parallel binaries (MPI) for Pandas and NumPy code—all without requiring any code rewrites.
Our latest benchmark demonstrates 20x to 240x speedup over traditional distributed computing frameworks like Spark, Ray, and Dask (code and details in repo).
The inspiration for Bodo came from my background in HPC, when I saw how extremely slow and hard to use Spark was (has gotten better over the years but still not great). Of course, a compiler has its own limitations (e.g. not all Python is compilable), but I think it’s leaps and bounds better.
Let me know what you think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made 2024 Crypto Recap to make an engaging way to see how your crypto portfolio stacked up this year.
If you aren't someone who spends all day monitoring the latest in crypto, but still have some crypto on eg Coinbase, you might have a general sense of how your portfolio is doing, but might not know other things like:
- How did your portfolio fare vs the S&P 500 this year?
- What were your best and worst trades, if you had any?
- How does your crypto behavior compare to others?
I made 2024 Crypto Recap to make a fun, quick way to see all these in a familiar format.
I had the idea to make this because around the end of the year is usually when I'm checking in on my own financial situation; and a lot of the personal finance tools I use for that don't have great support for crypto. I was surprised to learn that much of this data was just an API call away thanks to Coinbase, and of course took inspiration from many of the other wrapped products out there, too.
I hope you learn something interesting and maybe get a chuckle out of it. Feedback welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever get lost searching through genetic literature? I've built a new interface for bioRxiv+medRxiv to directly browse preprint findings on the genome!
To begin I downloaded 7TB's of bioRxiv+medRxiv preprints and extracted mentions of genetic variant ID's or positions. Documented in "How to download bioRxiv on a budget": http://sitlabs.org/writing/biorxiv.html
This project started after I was trawling through Google Scholar to review a gene when I realised I had missed relevant upstream findings which hadn't been linked to the gene. I wondered if there could be a better interface to explore genetic literature?
Next I provided the variant mentions and paper context to gpt-4o-mini and requested structured output summarising the scientific finding. Finally I mapped all variants to the latest genome build and plotted them on our custom genome browser.
This project was made by the new Scientific Interface & Tooling Lab (http://sitlabs.org) at Oxford. We will be releasing new interfaces and tools to improve scientific productivity with an initial focus on biology research.

We originally launched this just under a month ago as a clip playlist generator, and while we saw some initial excitement, we soon realized a tough truth: people just don’t create playlists very often.
So, we’ve been working on refining the product into something more practical and frequently used—an answer engine. Think Perplexity, but every source is a real person speaking in a YouTube video.
We’ve been using this for product comparisons, primary source research, and getting startup advice from trusted sources (like the YC Channel).
Excited to see if you find it useful!

Whether you are a longtime Acorn user (like me), or a would-be new user, you should set aside some time to actual read Acorn’s documentation. It’s a full user manual, and it not only describes, in detail, what every feature in the app does and how to use them, but also a vast array of “how-to” tutorials, many of them videos.
In broad strokes, there are two approaches to documenting a serious, professional-level app or software system. One was is a comprehensive functional reference resource. That’s a way that you, the user, can teach yourself how to use a feature, refresh your memory about a feature you haven’t used in a while, or even just check to see if a certain feature even exists. The other is a narrative, storytelling, tutorial approach. That’s not teaching yourself — that’s letting an expert teach you, and today that’s often a visual approach through video.
Acorn’s document is so thorough that it encompasses both approaches. Either one would qualify Acorn as a well-documented application. But by including both, Gus Mueller should be given some sort of medal or award. Different people learn in different ways, and Acorn’s documentation is there for everyone.
It should go without saying, but no serious tool — hardware or software — is complete without thorough, polished documentation. Acorn goes above and beyond. It’s amazing enough that a company as small as Flying Meat — it’s really just Gus and his wife Kirstin — has produced a full-fledged professional-strength image editing application that has remained modern and cutting-edge for 17 years and counting. But it’s also accompanied by first-class comprehensive documentation.

Formaldehyde, used for everything from preserving dead bodies to binding wood products and producing plastic, is extremely widespread and causes far more cancer than any toxic air pollutant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hakone is a town famed for its volcanic landscape, including a large caldera lake with a stunning view of Mount Fuji and onsen resorts. Historically, it flourished as a post station with a border checkpoint, situated on the road connecting Tokyo—then known as Edo—and Kyoto.

The 319-mile-long road was called the Tokaido or "East Sea Road," a name which survives today as a bullet train line. The cobblestone pavements of the road have survived at three points: Kanaya, Kikukawa, and Hakone.

The Hakone portion of the Old Tokaido  Way was known as a perilous point back in the Edo period, a steep mountain pass often slippery with mud. Even after it was paved with stones around the 17th century, travelers are said to have had a hard time getting past the pass.

In 1618, the shogun’s government planted cedar trees along the road, 412 of which have survived to this day as a scenic lakeside avenue. The feudal-era atmosphere still hangs in the area, and walking on the cobblestone pavement in the woods will let you feel like a journeying samurai.]]></summary>

I built this as a solo developer using Elixir and Phoenix LiveView, which means minimal JavaScript and fast load times. I’m seeing less than 100 KB in assets and pages loads in under 0.5 seconds for the project I’m using to track Planisphere’s own development.
While the major features are already in place, including user management, I’m actively building out feature parity, including integrations, dynamic iteration velocity, reporting, and more.
Planisphere offers a 14-day free trial with no credit card required, after which it’s just $6 per user per month. I’m also working on migration tools to make the transition seamless. If you’re looking for help migrating data or are interested in partnering to build these tools, reach out at martin@planisphere.dev.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Charlotte Hornets scheduled a Christmas-themed on-court skit for a break in the second quarter of their home loss Monday to the depleted 76ers. The setup involved Hugo, the mascot of the Hornets, learning what a couple of participating children most want for Christmas, and then delivering the goods. The payoff, as far as I can tell, was supposed to come with the final wish: A kid tells Hugo, sadly, that his father is moving the family to Philadelphia, and Hugo saves the day by producing a new father, clad in a Hornets jersey, to keep the family in Charlotte. You're rolling your eyes now, but someone at the Hallmark Channel is rubbing their hands together greedily while their assistant speed-dials Luke Macfarlane.
To set up this joke, the skit had to first demonstrate that Hugo had Santa-like powers. The second and penultimate child to interact with Hugo, a 13-year-old named Jack, asked for and received a Playstation 5. In the same way that the children in the punchline did not get to keep the actor in the Hornets jersey, Jack was never intended to keep the Playstation 5; the expensive hardware was meant to establish Hugo's generosity, in order to set up the gag about how a Hornets-loving dad, to replace your regular, crappy one, would a great and wonderful gift. The Hornets were giving the gift of entertainment, to the audience, with a skit! They were not giving a PS5 to a child. Alexei Phillips, Jack's uncle, told Queen City News that after the skit the Hornets took back the PS5, and instead gave his nephew a Hornets jersey.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dan Moren, writing at Six Colors:
The newly released Acorn 8 adds a bunch of great
features to the mix. A few of them will be familiar to Apple
platform users: subject selection uses machine learning to let
you quickly isolate and grab the subject of a picture (there’s
also a corresponding “Remove Background” feature to simplify
that task) and a Live Text tool allows you to select and copy
text within an image.
For me, the star of the show is the fascinating Data Merge, which
is a bit like Mail Merge for images. If you’ve ever needed to
create the same image several times but with different information — nametags, for example, or personalized gift cards — this is a
life-saver. You open your template image, identify your variables,
then hand Acorn a CSV file with the relevant data and it will
process through them, assigning text where needed and even putting
images in assigned layers. It’s the kind of wild automation tool
that might not be something you need every day, but when you do
need it, there’s really no replacement.
The rare sweet spot that Acorn hits is that it’s super-approachable to new and casual users, who just need an image editor sometimes, and super-powerful for power users who want to dig in.

        <updated>2024-12-18T16:01:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dave Nanian, writing on the Shirt Pocket blog:
macOS 15.2 was released a few days ago, with a surprise. A
terrible, awful surprise. Apple broke the replicator. Towards
the end of replicating the Data volume, seemingly when it’s
about to copy either Preboot or Recovery, it fails with a
Resource Busy error.
In the past, Resource Busy could be worked around by ensuring
the system was kept awake. But this new bug means, on most
systems, there’s no fix. It just fails.
Since Apple took away the ability for 3rd parties (eg, us) to copy
the OS, and took on the responsibility themselves, it’s been up to
them to ensure this functionality continues to work. And in that,
they’ve failed in macOS 15.2. Because this is their code, and
we’re forced to rely on it to copy the OS, OS copying will not
work until they fix it. [...]
For those who may be working for Apple, or have good contacts, the
bug is FB16090831. A fix would be really helpful, folks.
This means Shirt Pocket’s outstanding utility SuperDuper can’t make a bootable clone of your startup drive on a machine running MacOS 15.2.0. It’s worth noting that you can still use SuperDuper (or other backup utilities) to clone all of your data, which is, by far, the most essential data in any backup. But bootable startup drives clones are an essential part of many people’s data integrity workflows.
This bug seems to affect CarbonCopyCloner and Apple’s own Time Machine, too. A bug like this is always unfortunate, but especially around the holidays, when it might take longer than usual to get fixed, even if the issue is escalated within Apple.

For Mexican restaurants and supermarkets, the holidays mean one thing: Tamal season is here
 It wasn’t until I moved to New York City for college that I realized how much I took the tamales of my childhood holidays for granted. A born-and-raised Southern Californian with a big Mexican American family, I had never known a Christmas without a pile of corn husk-wrapped tamales waiting next to a honey ham and the half dozen other sides my mom and aunts had prepared for us, the corn masa hot and inviting, begging us to dig in.

I work as an Android developer at a large retailer, on the app that the in-store employees use to
see their schedules, view product details, get support, etc. Part of our engineering on-call 
rotation involves helping these in-store employees with any app issues they may encounter. There are
always a few times every rotation where I know solving someone's problem would be way easier if I
could just see their screen as if I were in-store with them.
However, many of these employees are non-technical and wouldn't want to go through the onboarding of
TeamViewer or Zoom, are under time constraints in a busy store, or (understandably) just wouldn't
know how to get set up.

Whether it’s poached, baked in a tart, or cooked into jam, quince can shine in both sweet and savory dishes 
 If you have ever tried membrillo — the dense Spanish jam often paired with Manchego on a nice cheese plate, maybe with a handful of Marcona almonds and a glass of Tempranillo – you know the sweet, slightly floral flavor of quince. Its appearance, however, may remain a mystery. The pink hue and uniform slices of quince paste look nothing like the golden, lumpy fruit as it hangs on a tree during the autumn harvest season. 
At a glance, quince could be mistaken for an heirloom apple or pear, but hold one in your hand and you’ll soon understand a key difference between them – this rock hard fruit cannot be eaten raw. With a little heat and a little patience, …]]></summary>

With Tough Tongue AI, you can stumble, stammer, and say the weirdest stuff—then try again until you nail it. No judgment, no sweaty palms, and definitely no awkward pauses...okay, maybe a few, the AI is still far from perfect, but it’s all part of the fun!
It has been helpful and given me confidence to have those conversations I've been avoiding! Hope it's of help to you as well :)

Currently, this uses screenshots and LLMs support for extracting screen UI elements effectively. This is still a work in progress and attempting to make this work with local models via Ollama (the code is in place with some issues). As of now, Gemini and GPT 4o works the best for finding UI elements and planning the task.
Some examples that work as of now:
  1. Use gmail and ask @example.com for lunch next saturday  

 2.  Start a 3+2 chess game on lichess  

https://github.com/BandarLabs/clickclickclick
This improves the cost of one automation task from approx. $0.6 via Claude to:
$0.06 - OpenAI 4o mini as planner + free Gemini flash 1.5 (15 calls/min)
The Llama vision models will eventually make it 0.

Both the cabin and the city of Dodgeville are named for M. Henry Dodge, a man whose rapacious desire for wealth and power typified the era. In the early 19th century, the area belonged to the Ho-Chunk Nation. The Ho-Chunk and other Indigenous nations had mined the area for lead for centuries, often selling to French and American traders.

The deal is available in-store only at participating locations (you can find a list of participating locations on the Smashburger website here). The deal is good on both single-patty and double-patty versions of the chain's various burgers.
Interestingly enough, the deal is not limited to one use (i.e. one free burger) per person so you can buy something like four burgers and get four burgers free. The relevant fine print reads as follows:

"For each burger or sandwich purchased in a transaction, receive one (1) complimentary order of any burger or sandwich (protein substitutions available) (not including applicable taxes) on the menu that is of equal or lesser value to the item purchased.  Must use promo code 4031 at checkout to redeem this offer in person at a participating location.  No limit on number of qualifying complimentary items that may be redeemed with coupon in a single transaction.  Offer valid only for item of equal or lesser value."

 Tis the season for lots of things — hot cocoa, gift shopping, and perhaps most importantly, cookie swaps. These annual exchanges of delicious baked goods have become increasingly popular in recent years, and maybe you’ve been invited to one but aren’t exactly a great baker. Or perhaps you’re interested in hosting your first-ever cookie swap, but have no idea where to start. That’s where Aimee France, a baker and the mind behind the wildly popular Instagram account formerly known as @yungkombucha420, comes in. 
France first encountered the cookie swap as a child, when her mother would attend a yearly ladies’ nigh. “My mom would always come home with a ton of cookies, and that…]]></summary>

Last year, I quit my corporate job and went full-time on ProjectionLab, the long-term financial planning app I've been building for the past 4 years, which some of you may recognize. The decision to go all-in felt like a huge leap. But it was the right call, and it's been a good year.
And without the HN community, it would not have happened. As I mentioned last time [0], the feedback on my original Show HN is THE reason I'm still here working on this. I'm really grateful for that. And I hope the way I’ve grown PL -- staying bootstrapped and focused on users -- resonates with the early supporters who helped to shape it.
For now I'm still the only engineer, burning the candle at both ends, but luckily I'm not feeling burnt out myself!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN. I made a little JS library for streaming structured data from LLMs using leniently-parsed XML as a medium.
E.g.
    await simple('fun pet names', {
      schema: { name: Array(String) },
      model: 'openrouter:mistralai/ministral-3b'
    }); // => ["Daisy", "Whiskers", "Rocky"]

When using LLMs, I've ended up gravitating towards boring time-tested XML-esque tag-based delimiters instead of JSON/function-calling for the following reasons:
- Diverse presence in training corpuses (consider flavours of content commonly adjacent to these syntaxes vs. JSON)
- HTML was built for fallible humans to write; LLMs are equally fallible. Let them cook [html]!
- IME better and more consistent adherance than very delicate JSON/YAML etc.
- Lenient by nature (following Postel's law of being liberal …]]></summary>

I noticed senior tech folks have valuable knowledge in their work docs – processes, templates, guides. This is expertise worth thousands, sitting unused. But they rarely share it: too busy for courses, unsure about value, or overwhelmed by setup.
I built Tapflow (https://tapflow.co) to fix this:
- Notion-like editor you already know
- Drop your content, set price
- Get instant product page
- Built-in payments
Numbers:
- Some early users made $20k+ from their products
- 1000+ registered pros, mostly word of mouth, Reddit and PH
- Profitable, bootstrapped side-project
Would love feedback:
- What stops you from sharing your expertise?
- How would you price your technical knowledge?
Try it: https://tapflow.co
Stack:
Backend: nginx, express.js, Apollo GraphQL, postgreSQL, redis, Stripe
Frontend: next.js, react-query, GraphQL, Material UI, yoopta wysiwyg Hosting: AWS, DigitalOcean, bunny.net
Free to use, 10% fee on sales or Pro tier.

My biggest qualm with drinks that advertise themselves as spicy is that they’re never spicy enough, but Ghia does not have this problem. It’s not hot enough to be unpleasant, but spicy enough to keep you warm through the rest of winter.

Not Oscar season, but rather that stretch when the halls of streaming services are decked with the brightly lit, thinly disguised advertisements that are the year's new Christmas movies.

Sabrina is proud to say they are a real Christmas freak, and this year they asked some of their colleagues to watch some of the most, uh, available new holiday movies. The fifth movie in our lineup is The Christmas Quest, a movie that pushes the boundary of what a neckline can be.
Sabrina Imbler: I’m so excited to talk with both of you about Hallmark’s first and potentially last foray into the special kind of love that stems from a mutual interest in Icelandic antiquities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you ever want to embed a super long string in JavaScript, and find yourself escaping quotes or interpolations by hand?
I find this comes up a lot, particularly when you're doing code generation stuff, because you need to have examples of code for the LLM, and that code often has strings embedded inside it. For example, take a look at the code properties in this JSON array[1].
Introducing stringify.org, the world's only correct-by-definition JavaScript string encoder website. It uses JSON.stringify, which is the only guaranteed method to output a string that is also valid JavaScript. It's in the spec.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
My girlfriend and I wanted to find a fun ay to improve our bird recognition skills, as birding knowledge felt so out of reach to us.
So we decided to create Birdle, a daily bird guessing game. Our journey started in South Africa with our wonderful and fortuitous collaboration with BirdLife South Africa. After the incredible and warm reception, our players convinced to finally start covering other countries. This year we worked hard to release for testing new versions for the UK and, just today, the US.
The game is also available as an app at:
- Android: https://android.birdle.world
- iOS: https://ios.birdle.world
The version is still in beta for testing, as we are still learning about US birds, so any feedback is strongly appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While building SaaS products, we noticed a recurring problem: content performance hinges on the first few words. Hooks determine success, but defining and generating effective hooks programmatically is hard.
Here’s how we approached the challenge:
1. The problem:
Attention is subjective and context-dependent. Identifying patterns that consistently work across platforms is complex.
2. Our approach:
- Data collection: Analyzed high-performing LinkedIn posts, social media ads, and email subject lines.
- Lightweight NLP system: Developed a system to identify linguistic patterns like structure, emotional triggers, and readability.
- Fine-tuned GPT models to generate hooks based on frameworks observed in the data.
3. Tech challenges we tackled:
- Balancing creativity and relevance to ensure hooks are engaging without veering into clickbait.
- Building 15+ adaptable frameworks such as curiosity-driven questions, data-backed insights, and emotional prompts.
- Iterating with user feedback to refine hook quality and ensure consistent results.
The result is a system that identifies attention-grabbing patterns and generates hooks that perform well across platforms.
We’re actively building out new features and optimizations. If you have feedback on our approach, the tech, or ideas to explore, we’d love to hear from you. Reach us at support@copytruck.com.

- Find S3 buckets without encryption enabled and their total size
And it works surprisingly well. Let me know what do you think!

As a support rep, I spent months copying email templates from sticky notes. It was time-consuming and frustrating, especially when formatting got messed up.
That’s why I built Tempstr — a tool that lets you instantly access and copy your most-used templates, complete with preserved formatting, all without leaving your browser tab.
Tempstr works seamlessly with the Chromium extension I also developed, which uses a restricted API key to securely fetch your templates.
If repetitive email tasks have been a headache for you, I’d love for you to check it out and share your feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN!
We developed a browser extension that blocks distracting sites. The killer feature is that we use LLMs and user-defined goals to provide the best possible blocking experience.
The decision-making process is not binary, we have multiple categories, allowing for more nuanced user interactions. This makes the browsing experience much less frustrating compared to other website blockers.
Sites like Reddit or YouTube are not always bad, and Wikipedia or other educational resources are not always good. By considering what the user is working on, we are able to make more informed and effective decisions.
Other blockers rely on pre-made blocklists for distracting websites. This approach is clearly insufficient for most use cases, as curating such lists is tedious—whether for the developer or the user.
We've also added quality-of-life features, including whitelists, blacklists, active hours, temporary unblocking, nuclear mode and a well-integrated (and optional) Pomodoro timer.
Learnings:
Initially, we scraped page content to make decisions. However, this approach posed significant privacy concerns. Now, all our decisions are based on tab metadata, ensuring a much better level of privacy and much better performance. No page content is transferred to the server.
Data collection:
We don't store browsing data unless the user explicitly reports incorrect decisions, BYOB model version will be released soon as well based on user demand.

Immediately, his fate became the subject of an international debate: Should he stay in the U.S.? Or should he be returned to Cuba, to live with his father? From our play cousins at Futuro Studios, this is part of their series Chess Piece: The Elián González Story.

Fourteen years ago, Congress set out to remedy a basic unfairness in the tax code. The tax that funds Medicare, because it’s aimed mainly at wages, hits even the poorest American workers. But the wealthy could easily avoid paying their share. So lawmakers created a new type of Medicare tax to capture the kinds of income the rich often enjoy: interest, dividends and capital gains from investments.
A host of billionaires — sports team owners, oil barons, Wall Street traders and others — have managed to avoid paying it, ProPublica found. 
To study who was actually paying the new tax, ProPublica analyzed its trove of IRS data conta…]]></summary>

ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.
In states with abortion bans, ProPublica has found, pregnant women have bled to death, succumbed to fatal infections and wound up in morgues with what medical examiners recorded were “products of conception” still in their bodies.
These are the very kinds of cases state maternal mortality review committees are supposed to delve into, determining why they happened and how to stop them from happening again.
But panels in states that have recently imposed strict bans on abortion have done little to uncover whether the laws are contributing to maternal deaths…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently tried out an AI-driven tool called Cora Intelligence, and it’s been a game-changer for lead generation. Instead of working with a preloaded database or enriching a list of existing leads, it lets you input your industry and generates fresh leads tailored to your needs.
The standout feature is its AI-driven data customization—you can request specific details like product prices or summaries in plain language, and the tool retrieves the information for you. It even includes a chatbot where you can ask follow-up questions about any lead and get answers instantly, saving a ton of time on manual research.
Does anyone know of other tools that combine lead generation with AI-powered data enrichment and instant chat-based queries? I’d love to explore more options!

- It is 100% type safe. It supports the use of zod schemas to declare endpoints
- It has great DX. It auto-infers a client function for every endpoint you declare, making it extremely useful for developing full-stack web apps which are completely written in TypeScript
- It is highly modular. The middleware engine is unlike most other existing implementations and follows a functional-style paradigm
It is still in early development stages. Feedback is highly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I built this tool in a few hours because I needed a quick way to create profile pictures and email signature images. With Propic, you can upload a photo, remove the background, and replace it with a colorful round pill of your choice.
The background removal happens entirely client-side, so your photo never leaves your device. It’s fast, private, and easy to use.
You can find a link to the GitHub repo on the webpage.
Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions for improvements!

How it works:
1. Connect with the tools your business uses (currently Slack or Gmail).
2. Create workflows by dragging and dropping nodes onto the canvas.
3. Listen to incoming events or trigger workflows manually.
Behind the scenes:
1. Each workflow runs as a durable, long-running execution.
2. AI agents within the same workflow share memory.
3. AI agents associate different channels, such as Slack threads or Gmail email threads, with workflows and can understand when replies are linked to specific workflow executions.
Try it out:

There will be bugs!! But I’d really appreciate your feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gus Mueller:
This is a major update of Acorn, and is currently on a
time-limited sale for $19.99. It’s still a one time
purchase to use as long as you’d like, and as usual, the full
release notes are available. I want to highlight some of my
favorite things below.
“Select Subject”, “Mask Subject”, and “Remove Background” are new
commands which use machine learning (or A.I. if you prefer) to
find the most important parts of your image, and then perform
their respective operations. This has been a request for a long
time, and while I was doubtful of it’s utility, it’s actually
pretty fun to play with and more useful than I figured it would
be. So I’m glad I took the time to integrate it.
You can now set your measurement units to inches, centimeter, or
pixels, and it shows up across the tools for your image, not just
specific ones. This includes the crop palette, shape dimensions,
filter settings… well, pretty much everything. This might be the
oldest feature request I’ve implemented so far. And then related
to this, Acorn 8 now has an on canvas ruler which you can use to
measure out distances, straighten your image with, or even
redefine the DPI.
Look up Table (LUT) support. LUTs are pretty fun, and they work by
mapping one set of colors to another, enabling consistent or
stylized visual effects. LUTs are used primarily in photography or
filmmaking, and you can download and install new LUTs from various
places across the internet.
And more, so much more. The release notes are copious, and for me, always interesting. Acorn remains one of my most-used tools. It’s fast, reliable, powerful, extensible/scriptable, and the interface makes so much intuitive sense. That’s all been true since version 1.0 back in 2007, and that’s why it’s been my go-to image editor since it was in early beta before version 1.0 back in 2007. It’s just faster and more powerful today.
Acorn is, simply put, one of the best Mac apps ever made. It’s that good. You’re nuts (sorry) if you don’t check it out while it’s available for just $20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made this app for myself, but it's probably worth sharing.
When I tried to find a nice app that I could use to check air quality multiple times a day, I was shocked. All of them looked boring with traffic-light coding and overcrowded with unnecessary data. On top of that, they either contained ads or required payment.
I didn't want to use any of those apps every day, so I thought, "Well, how hard could it be?" and accepted the challenge. I expected to finish development in a month, but since I'm a designer and don't normally program apps, I had to learn Swift on the go. This required a month more than I expected.
In my designs, I'm usually way too focused on efficiency. Since this was my personal project, I wanted to experiment, so I didn't use standard controls or color coding.
Inspired by avant-garde style, I used forms and movement to convey air quality, as well as an asymmetrical layout and overflowing visualizations. I enjoy using the app, and I hope you will, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even before kickoff, the final of the NCAA men's soccer championship was special as a meeting between two underdogs. Marshall, which won its first title in the 2020 season as an unseeded team, was the 13th seed this year and reached the final by defeating the No. 1 Ohio State. Meanwhile, unseeded Vermont beat two-seed Pitt and three-seed Denver on its way to the title game. The Thundering Herd and Catamounts put together a real thriller Monday night, as Vermont won its first championship in program history on a sudden-death goal in overtime.
That goal is at the 7:56 mark of the highlight reel below, though the entire second half of the match was very dramatic. Marshall took a 1-0 lead in the 57th minute after Vermont keeper Niklas Herceg mishandled a tough cross right into the path of Tarik Pannholzer. Herceg kept his team in it with a beautiful save minutes later, and in the 81st minute, Marcell Papp took advantage of a poor clearance from Marshall keeper Aleksa Janjic to start and finish a one-two with a shot from just inside the box. You're here for the winner, though. In overtime, centerback Zach Barrett intercepted a pass in the Vermont half and smacked a speculative longball for Maximilian Kissel. The forward shrugged off his defender, then dribbled around Janjic and scored.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since 2018, Christmas—or rather, XXXmas—has made a provocative, year-round statement in an Oslo traffic circle. At its center stands a 20-foot-tall (6-meter) figure, simply called Santa—a creation that has become both a curiosity and a controversy.

The striking red bronze sculpture, created by Los Angeles artist Paul McCarthy, has earned nicknames like the “Dildo Gnome” and “Santa with Butt Plug” because the object Santa holds—a Christmas tree—bears a suggestive resemblance to a sex toy. With exaggerated features and provocative humor, it’s impossible to miss.

McCarthy frames his work as a critique of Western consumerism and the holiday season’s excesses, blending high and low culture with playful irreverence. He notes that an innocent Christmas icon can carry distinctly adult undertones: while it might simply be a Christmas tree, it could also resemble a butt plug—redefining it as abstract art.

Public opinion in Oslo is divided: some see the statue as a tacky distraction, while others embrace its absurdity as a quirky addition to the cityscape. Even far-right organizations have voiced their disapproval, arguing that it undermines traditional values, sparking debates about artistic expression and cultural identity.

Christian Ringnes, brewer heir and philanthropist, whose foundation funded the project, calls the statue a bold centerpiece for the area—an amusing, lively twist for an otherwise unremarkable spot. Ringnes admits he initially saw it as a jolly Santa Claus, only later recognizing its more provocative interpretations.

Oslo’s version, painted bright red and constructed from rough, horizontal slices, differs from the smooth, dark, unpainted original in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Planned for installation in 2001, the Dutch statue faced delays and was ultimately relocated a couple of times after intense backlash to its design.]]></summary>

Svensdotter testified that several years before, she had been approached by a handsome man dressed in gold who called himself the Älvakungen, meaning “Elf King.” (Elf can be used generically for all humanlike spirits of nature, similar to the term fairy). He led her into the forest, to a great hall hidden beneath a mountain, where they danced and reveled with other elves in fine clothes.

        <link href="https://pypi.org/project/najaeda/"/>
        <updated>2024-12-17T19:56:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to introduce Naja EDA, a Python package designed to streamline post-synthesis Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows.
Naja EDA offers a robust framework that enables both software and hardware developers to efficiently navigate and manipulate electronic designs.
Key Features:
- Comprehensive Netlist Exploration:
  . Navigate netlist hierarchies with ease.

  . Access multiple levels of detail, including bit-level and bus-level granularity.

  . Explore instance-by-instance or utilize flattened views at the primitives level.

  . View per-instance connections or comprehensive equipotential networks.

  . Apply and manage design changes seamlessly.

  . Experiment with new EDA concepts using an intuitive API.

  . Build tailored tools to address specific challenges without relying on proprietary EDA software.

Simple example - print all instances in the design:
    def print_netlist(instance):
        for child_instance in instance.get_child_instances():
            print(f"{child_instance}:{child_instance.get_model_name()}")
            print_netlist(child_instance)

- https://pypi.org/project/najaeda/
- https://github.com/najaeda/naja
We would love to hear your feedback and learn more about how we can make naja EDA useful for software and hardware designers !
Looking forward to your thoughts!

From casual kickbacks to formal family dinners, here’s a playlist sure to please any crowd
 December belongs to the at-home entertainers. Early winter holidays and cooler weather offer myriad reasons to host events at home, from casual Christmas cookie swaps to intimate, cozy dinner parties. And one of the most fun, albeit daunting, tasks associated with hosting an event at home is organizing a playlist that sets the proper mood — especially when the genre is as polarizing as holiday music.
People have volatile reactions to holiday music; tearing up to a hymn at midnight mass, singing along to a classic, and excited gasps when a childhood tune unlocks a core memory. For everyone who thinks “Last Christmas” is a straight-u…]]></summary>

The best food trends of the year included cookbook clubs, conchas, and nonalcoholic cocktails
 To say it’s been a tumultuous year for many of us is perhaps an understatement. But when asked to survey the world of food and drinks over the last 12 months, it was easy to find some bright spots. These are the food trends that Eater staff were most grateful for in 2024, from small aesthetic pleasures to larger nostalgic comforts. 
Cookbook clubs
I’ve been a part of a cookbook club since the middle of last year, but this year, they really blew up, with my friend Steph Lau’s cookbook club repeatedly going viral and even earning an appearance on Good Morning America.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emma Chamberlain's most recent YouTube video opens with a montage of archival clips of her trying on outfits, shopping, and then purging her clothes over the years. Despite having, in her estimation, thousands of articles of clothing, Chamberlain says she was never satisfied. Instead, once she had accumulated what she decided were too many clothes, she would do a massive purge of her closet—only to fill it back up again. It's an interminable cycle: Buying a new thing is the answer to your emotional issue du jour, that is until you've unintentionally filled your home with too many things, at which point the only thing you can do to feel better is to purge. 
Once Chamberlain had ruthlessly evaluated each of the pieces in her closet, what she was left with, to her surprise, was a sort of capsule wardrobe, a deliberately small, curated collection of clothing intended to be worn interchangeably. That Chamberlain, uber-influencer and proprietor of a 12 million–follower YouTube channel, has gone capsule is indicative of the sustaining appeal of the concept, and I believe indicates an attempt to exert aesthetic control in a time of marked economic and social instability.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-12-17T19:32:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I built a CLI tool designed to streamline job hunting for software engineers. You can manage your job search more effectively by populating your professional connections and tracking companies of interest. Once set up, you can deploy it to a server to continuously scrape new job postings and share them directly to a Discord channel via free webhooks. This makes it easy to stay updated on relevant opportunities in real-time.
Why I made this?:
LinkedIn sucks, their email blasts are often spammy and filled with irrelevant listings. On top of that, if you’re relying solely on mainstream platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed, it’s nearly impossible to be first in line for a newly posted opportunity. It scrapes company job boards directly, ensuring you’re notified of opportunities the moment they go public.
Still making improvements everyday but you can give it a try using Homebrew (macOs) or install via Cargo (windows, linux). Appreciate any feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blackmagic Design:
Blackmagic Design announced it will start taking pre-orders for
the new Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive camera — the world’s first
commercial camera system designed to capture Apple Immersive Video
for Apple Vision Pro — today with deliveries due to start in
early 2025. DaVinci Resolve Studio will be updated to support
editing Apple Immersive Video early next year, offering
professional filmmakers a comprehensive workflow for producing
Apple Immersive Video for Apple Vision Pro. Apple Immersive Video
is a remarkable 180-degree media format that leverages
ultra-high-resolution immersive video and Spatial Audio to place
viewers in the center of the action. [...]
Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive features a fixed, custom lens
system pre-installed on the body, which is designed specifically
to capture Apple Immersive Video for Apple Vision Pro. The sensor
delivers 8160 × 7200 resolution per eye with pixel level
synchronization and an incredible 16 stops of dynamic range, so
cinematographers can shoot 90fps 3D immersive cinema content to a
single file. The custom lens system is designed for URSA Cine’s
large format image sensor with extremely accurate positional data
that’s read and stored at time of manufacturing. This immersive
lens projection data — which is calibrated and stored on device — then travels through post production in the Blackmagic RAW
file itself.
$30,000 — not cheap, but not crazy. And this isn’t merely 3D in a rectangular frame — it’s 180° 8K 3D.
David Smith:
What really intrigues me about it is when/if it will show up for
rental. I have a few tentative ideas in this space I’d love to
explore but I don’t think would justify the cost of owning one.
Looks like Lensrentals rents a vaguely similar, traditional
Blackmagic camera kit for around $1,000/week ... which would make
experimentation much more accessible.

Running a family takes coordination to figure out who is doing what and when.  WindChime is an app built to make that a little easier.
It automatically sends notifications when you make a task request, and you'll get a notification when the task is complete so you don't have to follow-up to find out if something is done.
Current contact and todo apps create information silos necessitating messaging contacts and task requests back and forth. WindChime reduces the friction of coordination by making the information available across everyone's phones (parents, childcare, kids).
Built by two dads who want great apps for their family life.

Like many of you, I have been using AI extensively in my day-to-day work. One area where I find AI particularly valuable is in learning. I believe LLMs can help us humans unlock our true learning potential, which is why I built an initial version of a learning platform powered by foundational AI models.
With this platform, you can learn about any topic, create quizzes, flashcards, and even generate engaging podcasts to enhance your learning experience.
Please let me know what you think and if you have any feedback—I would really appreciate your time!

These are the food phenomena we’d like to bid adieu to in the coming year
 While 2024 saw many great things in the world of food and drinks — excellent new restaurants! An actually good season of Great British Bake Off! — there is much that the Eater staff would like to say goodbye to as we move into 2025. Some of these food and dining phenomena, from the benign annoyances to the potentially harmful, are perhaps more than mere trends. But, by naming them here we’re throwing our naive hope out into the universe that in the months to come they will please finally stop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started this project because I believe MCP has the potential to transform how AI models interact with external resources, but the ecosystem is still very fragmented. There's no central place to discover and compare all the server implementations available, which makes adoption and experimentation harder for developers.
I initially built the GitHub repo awesome-mcp-servers (https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers/), and it's been amazing to see the community contribute to it. Now, I'm taking it further with a directory that automates many tasks—introspecting servers to determine the tools, resources, and prompts they provide, inferring required configurations, and checking dependencies for vulnerabilities. These features are designed to make it easier for people to trust and use these servers in production environments.
While an open-source protocol is fantastic for innovation, I also think we need a centralized channel for addressing critical issues like security vulnerabilities, dependency management, and user support. My hope is that this directory not only grows with help from contributions, but also becomes a trusted resource for anyone entering the MCP space. If you're working on MCP servers or are interested in the project, I'd love to hear your thoughts!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN!
In a recent "Ask HN: What are you working on?" thread, I mentioned I was working on OCRing a large book:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41971614
The post generated some interest so I thought I would keep HN posted.
The book is Saint-Simon’s Memoirs -- an invaluable historical account of the French court under Louis XIV, full of wit, sharp observations, and of incredible literary value. I'm OCRing the edition of reference made between 1879-1930, that contains a lot of comments and footnotes: 45 volumes, ~27,000 pages.
Here's a link to a blog post that describes the techniques used so far (the project is still ongoing):
https://blog.medusis.com/38_Adventures+in+OCR.html
But you may also directly access the result here:
https://divers.medusis.net/boislisle/pub
This web app (not optimized for mobile, sorry) solves a tricky problem of preloading images efficiently. In short: preloading the next image isn't enough, since browsers will repaint if an image is moved, or scaled. Or browsers won't paint at all if visibility is hidden or opacity is zero, and will paint only when those values change. On an average, slow machine, this takes visible time. But if an image is simply behind another element, it will be painted, and the removal of the covering element or changing the z-index will not trigger a repaint.
(Preloading is important because it lets one review results fast; if one has to wait 150-200 ms between images it's simply discouraging).
Would love to hear feedback; happy to answer any question!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We built a way to go from requirements to a fully working admin panel/internal tool -type application within minutes. As a user you provide the various entities and their relationship plus any reports or dashboard widgets and it will generate it for you.
The problem with existing no code tools is that you still need to spend a lot of time building after figuring out what is needed (a problem of its own). Being able to focus on what is needed means you can build faster than designing, dragging, dropping, configuring.
What can you describe? Everything from tables, field types, relationships between tables and columns/fields, role-based access restrictions (RBAC), reports, dashboard metrics, bar/line/pie charts, lists.
This is made possible by fine-tuning Llama 3.1 to convert requirements into specs and code. Applications evolve over time and this means that the model has to be predictable between versions to ensure that the data/schema migrations can be generated cleanly, as well as provide any errors and warnings related to the requirements or data loss.
For non-developers this can be a huge time-saver since you don't have to use any additional developer resources. For developers it can be a great way to get 80+% of the way for complex apps (it's like super-scaffolding). Generated apps can be fully evaluated before purchase. A full git repo containing the back-end, front-end, migrations, etc. is the output of the entire process.
Currently the generated code base is TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next.js but the capability is there to generate different stacks because of the approach taken to not go directly to code when fine-tuning.
Brought to you by the team at Red Axle (https://redaxle.com)
Check out the video at https://youtu.be/rPppwB4jPlQ for a smaller app.
We look forward to your thoughts. Does building apps this way make sense for the super savvy HN crowd?

Let alone this being hard to set up and taking time, it is also pretty high-maintenance. I had to do a lot of infra work, and while this being billable hours for me I didn’t enjoy the work at all. For some parts of it, there were nice solutions like dbt, but in the end for an end-to-end workflow, it didn’t work. That’s why I decided to build an end-to-end solution that could take care of data ingestion, transformation, and Python stuff.

Authorities have charged a man named Luigi Mangione with the crime, and if a note he was carrying with him at the time of his arrest is to be believed, Thompson was killed as a response to the cruelty and depravity of the American healthcare industry, which has since become an urgent topic of conversation in American media and culture.
Evidence of the killer’s victory can be found on any news channel, or in any number of mainstream publications. There was a brief period of time when one could get away with dismissing the enthusiasm that swelled around Mangione’s alleged act as something that only existed in the unreality of the internet—the byproduct of a small, irony-poisoned segment of the country that best understands how to use social media as a megaphone. If that enthusiasm ever was contained, it has since escaped: SNL is now a safe place to joke about Thompson’s death, and respectable publications like The New Yorker and New York Magazine have acknowledged Mangione’s folk-hero status. The effectiveness of the killing can also be found in reactions from those in the government. New York Governor Kathy Hochul has convened a “safety summit” for New York CEOs, and Florida authorities charged a mother with making terroristic threats for saying “delay, deny, depose” (the words Mangione allegedly wrote on his shell casings) during a phone call with her insurance provider. Senator Elizabeth Warren evidently takes the groundswell of support for Mangione seriously enough to pander to those who sympathize with him. She recently went on TV to say, “Violence is never the answer … but you can only push people so far.”]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-12-17T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originating over a thousand years ago, the Nebuta Matsuri is a traditional summer festival held in several cities in Aomori Prefecture, most notably in Aomori City. Originally a lantern festival, Nebuta has since developed into a parade involving huge papier-mâché floats that mainly portray kabuki actors, mythological figures, and folk heroes.

Founded in 2011, the Nebuta Museum Wa Rasse exhibits such floats used in the most recent festival, celebrating this unique cultural event and archiving its history. The name was chosen as the winner of a public naming competition; rasse is based on rasse-ra, the typical heave-ho shout cried out by the float-haulers, while wa has several meanings in Japanese including "harmony" and "circle." Together, the name is also meant to evoke the word warai, or "laughter."

Located in the Aomori Waterfront area, the museum is only a short walk from the city’s central station. The building that houses the museum is an eye-catching sight, with red vertical louvers covering its exterior and giving its entrance a look like that of a steel curtain parting to welcome visitors.

The museum is a dark, spacious hall filled with colorful lights coming from the Nebuta floats, showcasing traditional artistry and folklore. The papier-mâché figures are astonishingly dynamic, with flowing hair and splashing water magically brought to life.]]></summary>

It also includes a bunch of flags to get exactly what you want in the format you want.
I got this idea as I was trying organize the large amount of local git repos I had. I also found it particularly useful when traveling since I use a different device. In these cases, it is really helpful to know which local git repos I forgot to push commits or have fallen behind the remote version.
Hope you find it really useful, let me know if you like it and also if you have any feedback for it!

Many sellers like me rely on DMs or clunky solutions, which can make managing sales and payments a headache. I wanted to simplify the process by turning my Instagram into a fully functioning storefront, quickly and effortlessly.
What CheckoutLink does: 
 Turn Instagram posts into shoppable links—sell directly through DMs or bio links. 
 Manage products, buyers, sales and payments from one simple dashboard.
 Sync your PayPal or Stripe account to get paid instantly. 
 Quick setup with no coding or website required.
I'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback or any suggestions you have to make CheckoutLink even better. Feel free to ask me anything!
Thank you so much for your support and I hope CheckoutLink can help you grow your business as well!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN! Agora is a search engine for e-commerce products. We've indexed 4 million products sold on 8,100 Shopify and WooCommerce stores and made them easy to purchase with a single cart transaction. Think of a decentralized Amazon.
I originally launched Agora as a side project here on HN to find a pair of red shoes for my wife last Christmas. I quickly realized that some of the best products on the internet are sold by small online stores that struggle to get the same visibility as large retailers. I started Agora on a mission to solve this problem. If you sell the best pair of red shoes in the world, customers should be able to find it.
We recently built a merchant dashboard that helps Shopify and WooCommerce merchants sell more on our search engine. Agora Merchants connects to your existing e-commerce store without any painful setup required and helps you track your store's performance on Agora. We don't take a commission of sales, orders are routed to your existing point of sale system, and inventory is automatically uploaded and refreshed. We do this with a combination of crawlers and AI agents.
So how is this different than Amazon? Both Amazon and Agora give network effects to stores (i.e. if you're searching for red shoes from one store, you may also want to buy a red dress sold by a different store). The key difference with Agora is that you continue selling on your existing e-commerce store, without having to manage inventory and payouts on another platform. This creates a magical experience for our merchants that saves them hundreds of hours. We believe in a future where merchants can sell however they want, we just bring them more customers.
I'd love your feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New Crispy Chicken Nuggets arrive at Taco Bell restaurants nationwide starting December 19, 2024 and will be joined by a trio of new spicy dipping sauces including Hidden Valley Fire Ranch Sauce.

A limited-time menu item, Taco Bell's Crispy Chicken Nuggets features white meat chicken bites marinated in "zesty jalapeno buttermilk flavor," breaded with a mix of breadcrumbs and tortilla chips, and then fried until crispy. It sounds like a chicken nugget version of the chain's previous tortilla-crusted chicken strips.
To accompany the new Crispy Chicken Nuggets, Taco Bell offers a trio of new sauces, including:


Hidden Valley Fire Ranch Sauce - Taco Bell’s first-ever ranch partnership offers a blend of Taco Bell's Fire Sauce and Hidden Valley Ranch.  
Bell Sauce -  "A familiar, rich, creamy, and tangy signature blend with subtle chili notes crafted with tomatoes, red chiles, and garlic." 
Jalapeno Honey Mustard - A sweet-heat sauce featuring honey mustard with a kick of jalapeno.  


Taco Bell's Crispy Chicken Nuggets are available a la carte in a 5-piece order with one dipping sauce for a suggested price of $3.99 and in a 10-piece order with two dipping sauce for $6.99.
You can also get them as part of a combo meal with regular Nacho Fries and a large fountain drink starting at $5.99 with 5 nuggets and $8.99 with 10 nuggets.
For more variety, there's the Crispy Chicken Nugget Deluxe Meal. It includes five nuggets, 1 dipping sauce, a Crunchy Taco, a Beef Chalupa, regular Nacho Fries, and a medium fountain drink starting at $10.49.

Baking my wedding cake helped me save money — and be really present as a bride
 Everything about my wedding fell into place, which was the only way I could have ever considered having one. We chose the venue because a friend was its beverage director and offered his help in setting it up. The day we got the wedding license, we met another friend for dinner and he let us know that he had officiated a friend’s wedding, so we asked if he’d oversee ours. I sent a photographer whose work I love an Instagram DM asking for her suggestions for someone who might want the gig, and to my great surprise, she offered to do it herself for a wildly under-market rate. The guest list was kept to 30 people because we only wanted our close family and dearest friends in attendance (…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At every event, tons of photos are taken, but they rarely get used well. As organizers, you post a handful on social media while the best moments are scattered across attendee phones. And if you’re hoping for engagement or visibility? It’s a grind.
We built Premagic, an event tool that flips this problem.
Here’s what we do:
Instant Photo Sharing: We use AI to auto-select the best event photos and share them in real time with attendees. They get photos they love. You get organic visibility when they share (and they do).
Branded Advocacy Posters: Personalized “I’m attending” or “I’m speaking” posters are generated automatically—no designer needed. Attendees become your event’s marketing army.
AI Avatar Check-Ins: We turn event check-ins into an experience. Attendees can generate personalized, branded avatars on the spot—fun, shareable, and sponsor-friendly.
We’ve tested this at over 2,000 events and seen a 3x increase in organic social reach for organizers. Event marketers and sponsors love it because it amplifies visibility without paid ads.
We’re event tech folks trying to make photos and moments work harder—organically.
Would love your feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers appear to have refreshed their mojo. It was never far gone, although consecutive home-and-away losses to the Atlanta Hawks confer a soupçon of illegitimacy so long as the Hawks remain the only team in the NBA to have lost twice to the abominable three-win Washington Wizards. The Cavaliers appear to have recovered from the wobble, and this is all normal basketball business in November and December, but it's enough to say that the team regressed after the best start in franchise history. That was inevitable. The questions had to do with how far their form would dip—are they as capable of excruciating lows as they are of rarified highs—and where precisely they'd sit in the league hierarchy once they'd settled.
That is possibly the most hedged and evasive basketblog lede ever written about a team with just four losses a third of the way through an NBA regular season. Part of that, I swear, is an effort to contain my own excitement about this Cavaliers team. I find them very easy to like, notwithstanding the few minutes every game that Donovan Mitchell spends waving his personal stamp around like a crazed mail clerk. Monday night they beat the absolute hell out of the Brooklyn Nets, recovering from a quick opening deficit with a vicious 16–0 run and then pouring it on, so that the final 39 minutes or so of a 48-minute contest were treated like an exhibition. Cleveland's scoring efficiency was downright unreasonable: The four starters not named Donovan Mitchell combined for 56 points and missed just five total shots and one free throw between them. Caris LeVert and Georges Niang drilled 8 of 14 three-point attempts off the bench. Without anyone even having a standout performance, the Cavs breezed to 130 points, and only Darius Garland kicking the ball around uncharacteristically and Sam Merrill forgetting how to shoot prevented them from sniffing 150.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always been fascinated by cryptographic principles, so I decided to dive deep into zero-knowledge proofs and implement a Groth16 proof verifier entirely in Rust. This project validates cryptographic proofs and demonstrates how succinct, verifiable computations can be achieved.
Using Rust's powerful libraries like arkworks, I implemented pairing checks, public input commitments, and proof validation logic while ensuring the code remains modular and efficient.
I handled the complexities of affine group operations, scalar multiplications, and optimized public input verification to make this a practical ZK verifier.
Let me know what you think! Happy to answer questions about the design, challenges, or ZK cryptography in general.

between conservative color-blindness and liberal race-consciousness that had dominated
race politics since the 1960s. Instead of color blindness and meritocracy, the
right now seeks to openly protect white, Christian men from liberalism and to
advance white Christian nationalism. Liberals no longer settle for
race-conscious policies, as they had since the 1960s. They have adopted a more

For most of my life, I only knew matzo as one thing: a dry, somewhat flavorless cracker that always came in the same orange-and-white cardboard box. We ate it during holidays, but never really enjoyed it, and certainly it never occurred to me to eat matzo on purpose beyond the 10 days or so a year when it was mandated. But is it any surprise that matzo became yassified? The latest company to tackle the unleavened market is Matzo Project, a cute, bubbe-themed brand that makes matzo good enough for even goyim to snack on: Matzo Project. It makes the usual “flats” and also meal for ball making, but may I suggest unwrapping a bag of matzo chips?  Small, wafer-like crackers that come speckled with everything seasoning, cinnamon sugar, or just salt. They’re tasty and flavorful, but their key characteristic might be their hardiness, which makes them ideal for any thick dip.



No peeking! But check out what the Eater Advent Calendar has already revealed.  And check back each day for a new clutch condiment, gadget, or nibble that, yes, makes an amazing gift — but these surprises are just for you.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most of western Bulgaria is a moderate seismic risk zone, but it is also blessed with many hot springs. They vary in temperature and the healing mineral they naturally contain, and have been enjoyed ever since Roman times.

In Gorna Banya, the water has been revered for its healing nature for centuries. According to local folk tales, the waters had restored the once-abandoned village and healed a hunting dog from the valley of Sofia.

In 1922, a modern bathhouse with separate bathing areas and medical facilities was built, replacing an old Ottoman building. The ornate brick structure was designed in a late Vienna Secession style, with reinforced concrete domes and stone statues.

Public bathing culture started to decline in the 1960s as bathrooms became commonplace in new buildings, and collapsed further after the fall of the communist regime, as government subsidies for public baths dried out, leaving all but a few profitable structures closed and abandoned. The Gorna Banya bath house was no exception.

Today, the beautiful abandoned structure is a shadow of its former self. Yet contrary to most of its abandoned counterparts, it rarely falls completely silent. The water that once gave it life now flows freely right next to it, in a public fountain that attracts those who still seek the town's mineral-rich waters.]]></summary>

How acris.ai works:
1. Each step is an LLM prompt that you can chain together and execute. You can choose the type of a step: Text, JSON, Function Call, ReAct Agent, Vector DB etc.
2. Deploy it as a web application or JSON API
3. All free for now. Will implement usage based charging later
Feedback is welcome.

- Hit detect
- Get visual bounding boxes + JSON output

The chain is coming for McDonald’s and Chick-fil-A, and the end result doesn’t feel totally Taco Bell
 As anyone who frequents Taco Bell knows, most of its menu is just assemblages of the same few gloops. There is the bean gloop, the cheese gloop (a personal favorite), and of course, the beef gloop. These are the essential, constituent elements of most items on the Taco Bell menu, guaranteeing that if you like the Beefy 5-layer Burrito you’ll probably also like the Mexican Pizza.
The chain’s newest addition, however, is decidedly not gloop. It is chicken nuggets, which hit stores nationwide later this week (for now, on a limited basis). With a thick, craggy coating and breast meat, the end result exists more…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN,
I built a leaderboard app to track rankings for my Catan group. It’s based on the Elo ranking system—the same system used in chess.
Everyone starts with 1100 points, and your score changes based on game results. Beating a stronger player earns you more points.
Turns out, the "elo" system isn’t just for chess. It works for any competitive game. We’re now using it for a variety of board games, and even for padel, and tennis.
Recently, I decided to open it up to the public.
You can give it a try — it’s free.

This spring, the Justice Department announced a major victory against a drug firm that manufactured billions of opioid painkillers. Endo Health Solutions, the agency said, would face $1.5 billion in fines and forfeitures and plead guilty to a corporate criminal charge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I built FightJetLag.fyi to help travelers reduce jet lag and feel functional faster.
Huge fan of the sleep research and functional performance research and wanted to ensure everyone has the opportunity to understand Jet lag and plan for it!
You enter your travel details (current location, destination, date/time of travel), and it generates a tailored protocol to minimize jet lag. The suggestions are split into:
-Before Travel
-During Travel
-After Travel
The advice is based on sleep, nutrition, light exposure, and other science-backed strategies. You can also choose different levels of aggressiveness: mild, medium, or aggressive approaches depending on how seriously you want to tackle jet lag.
It's designed for anyone: frequent flyers, business travelers, athletes, or casual vacationers.
I’d love feedback on the site, the protocols, or any ideas to improve it. Does this solve a problem you've faced?
Try it out https://www.fightjetlag.fyi/ — and let me know what you think!
Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paul Kafasis, on the Rogue Amoeba blog:
Even as our products steadily grew in popularity, our relationship
with Apple was almost non-existent. Plenty of individuals inside
the company were fans, but we received very little attention from
Apple as a corporate entity. We didn’t much mind being outsiders,
but it meant that we often had zero notice of breaking changes
introduced by Apple.
During this time, Apple placed an emphasis on improving the
security of MacOS, continually locking the operating system down
further and further. Though their changes weren’t aimed at the
legitimate audio capture we provided our users, they nonetheless
made that capture increasingly difficult. We labored to keep our
tools functioning with each new version of MacOS. Through it all,
we lived with a constant fear that Apple would irreparably break
our apps.
In 2020, the disaster foreshadowed literally one sentence ago
struck. Beta versions of MacOS 11 broke ACE, our then-current
audio capture technology, and the damage looked permanent.
Kafasis is a friend and frequent guest on The Talk Show (and holds his own as a podcast co-host with a combustible collaborator), and I use quite a few apps in Rogue Amoeba’s suite, so I was familiar with the broad outline of this saga. But seeing it all spelled out made clear it was a lot more precarious than I thought.

        <updated>2024-12-16T23:17:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever solved a tricky problem at the command line, only to struggle documenting it later?  I built Savvy so you can capture and share your CLI solutions in seconds.
With a simple savvy record history command, you can:
   - Go back in time and cherry pick commands from your shell history
   - Automatically expand aliases
   - Redact sensitive information locally
   - Convert hard-coded values into runtime placeholders
   - Export locally to markdown files or create shareable team workflows using Savvy.

Some FAQs
Q) How Does Savvy’s CLI work?
   Savvy’s CLI uses shell hooks (full support for bash and zsh. Fish support is in beta) to capture commands. Savvy’s CLI never looks at any command outputs or active keystrokes. Users have to explicitly opt-in (by typing savvy record/savvy record history) to capture commands every single time.

   Once you select a particular workflow with savvy run, savvy starts a new sub-shell and walks you through each step of the way. No manual copy paste or editing commands to provide run time values.

   Demo: https://getsavvy.so/demo

   Savvy takes your redacted commands as input and uses Llama 3.x hosted on Groq to create a first draft of your workflow.

   Savvy ask/explain are powered by  GPT 4/GPT4o to convert natural language to shell commands and vice-versa.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is our Atlas of Water Science. It's a globe mapping water science that colleagues have done over the past few years. Approx 300 papers got analyzed. The pipeline sends open access papers to an LLM asks the LLM to extract areas relevant to science in a form suitable for a geocoder, then we use a geocoder to get lat lons. When things happen in the same spot we jitter the locations a bit to differentiate things. gpt4o-mini was used for most of the analysis. Some of the features on the website are directly invented by Claude. There are some errors when geocoding went wrong or locations were extracted incorrectly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm exited to share this project I've been working on with you. Simply, it makes productivity and studying instantly rewarding and engaging from the start, increasing the chance of consistency in the long term.
You can start "training sessions" which are the timers where you are meant to focused. During this, if you are studying you can take AI generated quizzes based on certain subjects. Right now its a dropdown selection of set topics as I'm not sure of the safety of allowing people to type whatever they want to the AI, but I might change that.
After the training sessions, based on the time trained and the team you have built, you receive points. These points can be used to build up your team by opening packs of various rarities. With this, you feel rewarded from getting points and being productive instantly. Along with this, you can join 'leagues' which are rooms with other people to compete to be the best. Also, you can compete in real time matches against others to make your team have more worth than show.
Its publicly released but I'm still improving it daily and all I would like is for people to use it and give feedback, good or bad. Thank you!

When I was in college, I went to a party that I’ll never forget.
 The theme was Alice in Wonderland, and the crowd outside of the house was made up of people dressed as Mad Hatters, Red Queens, and more. 
 But the real spectacle was inside. There was not a piece of furniture to be seen. The walls of all the empty rooms were covered in newspapers, and all the overhead lights had been replaced with black-light bulbs, filling the air with a purple haze. Someone had used the newspapers as a canvas, drawing giant mushrooms and other psychedelic shapes with white paint that glowed blue in the ultraviolet light. 
 Someone in that house had paid attention in chemistry…]]></summary>

Of the 119 works in the series, two depict the same location in today's Ueno Park: a horticultural oddity known as the Moon Pine Tree.

Founded in 1631 and moved to the current location in 1694, the Kiyomizu-Kannondō pavilion of the former Kan'ei-ji Temple complex is modeled after Kiyomizu-dera Temple in Kyoto, with its own version of the famous platform called the "stage." In front of it once stood the Moon Pine Tree, a landscaping wonder with a long branch that drew a perfect circle, from which visitors could have a scenic view of the Shinobazu Pond framed in a full moon.

The original Moon Pine Tree was knocked down in the early Meiji era during a typhoon and remained lost for nearly 150 years. In 2012, it was reconstructed with state-of-the-art horticultural techniques. Though often overlooked, it's worth climbing up to the Kiyomizu stage and take a look through the moon at the quaint, yet modern district of Ueno below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got approached by the finance department of a large company. There is a new regulation in Europe that mandates a defined XML-format for e-invoices for some transactions and - I kid you not - their SAP implementation wasn't able to address this. They also said that all solutions on the market were either cumbersome (think: manually typing in all fields) or required deep system integration.
I thought it cannot be that hard to use AI for this and built a little invoice converter that takes your PDF invoice in whatever form it is, and outputs exactly the XML structure that is required in the regulation. Given that AI is not perfect (but surprisingly close to it!), you can manually edit all fields.
Target users are companies where their current solution does not yet support the standard and that do not want to change their existing invoicing flow (incl. foreign businesses).
Trying it out is free. Given this is my first real B2B tool, would love some feedback!

Check an item, decide if you want it to be automatically relisted in N days or at X date (or never).
That's it: no AI, no notifications, no nothing.
Backstory:
As a product manager, I always wanted to build things but never had time to learn how to code them.
Six months ago, I asked people around if I should invest 20-something weeks into learning React or, in that timespan, LLMs would be capable of doing programming for me. The consensus was that I should learn to code. I disagreed with it.
Two weeks ago, I paid for GitHub Copilot and, with o1-preview's help, devised the plan and developed the actual code of my PWA. It works as a charm, so I, my family, and friends use it every day, precisely as planned.
Now, I can comfortably say that I still don't know how to code, but that won't stop me and shouldn't stop any other non-coder from developing something they want anymore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
Let me introduce Carton …
A product can be defined by the answers to your customers' questions. A feature brings together questions and answers. While the questions mostly remain the same, the answers can change and may correspond to different versions, forming a roadmap for future product success. A phenotype is the visualization of an answer, evolving as the answers change over time.
Carton provides a framework for product scoping (not project management or product design) that makes use of this definition.
Let's think even further. With the advent of artificial intelligence, the entire process of software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Soon, software will be created more through natural conversation than traditional programming languages.
Carton helps ensure you always have a clear record of what you've asked from the AI and, even better, helps to request what comes next.
Its a very early proof of concept phase. Super excited to hearing what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
I wanted to show what we have been working on for the last few weeks. We have done data extraction/web scraping for the last few months, and we built this internally to help us. However, clients requested a SAAS tool, so here it is!
You guys can test it out here (app.potarix.com). Everyone who signs up gets 5$ credits. Scraping each page takes up $0.10 of your credits. You are not charged for unsuccessful scrapes!
We launched last week, and our platform was super buggy. We initially launched without the concept of "jobs" in our product, so every time you wanted to scrape a platform, you would have to wait 5 minutes on one screen to get your results. Something is bound to happen in those 5 minutes, so the task would fail for some unknown reason.
Looking ahead, we built stuff in-house that we would love to include in the SAAS platform shortly. We have built functionality to click, type, scroll, etc. on the page. AI also tends to be wrong sometimes, so we created a tweakable script in the backend to control the agent's actions. That way, you are in control and can bring the script to 100% accuracy. We have also seen people battling to build infrastructure for their large-scale scraping projects. We wanna autonomously let folk set up parallelization and choose the infra for their project so everything is scraped as quickly and succinctly as possible from the SAAS.
If any of these future features sound interesting, feel free to book some time, and we can discuss how we can help you with these now!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Located near Kilmartin in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, Poltalloch House is a significant 19th-century mansion now in ruins. Constructed between 1849 and 1853, the house was designed by William Burn, a prominent architect known for his work in the Scottish Baronial style. Built for the Malcolm family, who were influential landowners in the area, the mansion features characteristic elements of the style, including turrets, battlements, and crow-stepped gables.

The house's decline began during World War II when it was requisitioned by the military. The wartime use led to significant wear and tear. After the war, the high costs of maintenance and changing economic circumstances contributed to the mansion's abandonment in the mid-20th century. Over time, Poltalloch House fell into disrepair, with its roof collapsing and interior largely destroyed.

Today, Poltalloch House stands as a ruin. While no full restoration has been undertaken, there have been efforts to stabilize the structure to prevent further deterioration. Despite its dilapidated state, the house remains an important example of William Burn’s architectural work and the Scottish Baronial style that was popular in the Victorian era. It is fascinating to view the way in which nature has taken over the ruins with many trees and vines running over the crumbling structures. The mansion and the surrounding estate are historically significant to the region, reflecting the social and economic history of Scotland’s aristocracy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How far can Manchester City fall? That's the question coming out of the weekend, as the four-time reigning champions suffered the latest indignity in what is now a run of eight losses in 11 games with just a single, solitary win. This latest blow came Sunday at the hands of its crosstown rivals, as Manchester United won the local derby in almost surreal fashion, turning around a first half 1-0 deficit into a two-goals-in-two-minutes late barrage to pick up the 2-1 win at City's shell-shocked stadium. The loss alone is bad enough for City, but the way that it lost, to what looked like a flaccid United side for about 98 percent of the match, will bring even more pain to Pep Guardiola and his beleaguered squad of expensive underachievers.

*Key features:*
- One-click WireGuard server deployment on Vultr/Linode
- Automatic server cleanup when inactive (configurable: 30min/1h/2h/4h or custom)
- Simple web UI for server management
- Downloads WireGuard configs directly
The cleanup feature monitors WireGuard connections - if no peers are connected for your set period, the server is automatically destroyed to save costs. You can adjust this timeout in the UI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few weeks ago, in a post primarily complaining about Google’s disingenuous claims about their Messages app’s support for encryption (they suggest, heavily, that it encrypts every message or most messages, but fact only supports encryption for RCS message sent between users of Google Messages on Android devices), I also complained about the fact that Google’s own Google Voice doesn’t support RCS at all.
Turns out Google Fi doesn’t support RCS fully either. Google Fi is Google’s cellular phone service. I actually use it to provide service to my Android burner phone. The prices are excellent and the service is fine for my minimal needs for a phone I barely use. But Google Fi offers something called “call and voicemail sync” that lets Fi users make and answer voice calls through the web. If you enable this, you lose RCS. See Reddit threads here and here with Fi fans complaining about it.
It’s just wild to me that Google would spend years waging a campaign urging Apple to support RCS, yet Google itself doesn’t support RCS in its own products.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chef Hiroki Odo uses a wagyu blend, sansho peppercorns, sake, and tamari to create this decadent burger.
 “I thought it would be nice to make a hamburger that mixed New York and Japan,” says chef Hiroki Odo. Actually, he made six. At Hall, Odo’s “conceptual bar” in the Flatiron District, the limited menu features a selection of wagyu burgers, from a simple single cheeseburger to one topped with A5 wagyu steak. 
Step by step, general manager Brian Saito walks through crafting Hall’s burgers. He starts with a blend of Sakura Wagyu chuck and A5 wagyu, finely grinding them and controlling just how much fat is in each patty. Then there’s the sauce, a combination of sansho peppercorns, “a perfect complement for the fattiness of the wagyu,” reduced in sake and tamari. It’s a sauce, Saito says, they also use at chef Odo’s titular kaiseki restaurant next door. All of it gets piled on buns made from the chef’s own recipe, “so their key point is a sense of unity.”
The entire Hall menu is in service of wanting to bring a variety of experiences to New York diners, says chef Odo, and to showcase all the cuisines Japan has to offer. But, he admits, multiple concepts in one space “isn’t the kind of restaurant you could open in Japan.” A cocktail and burger bar, in front of a chef’s counter, next to a kaiseki restaurant? That’s New York.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although far from the European front lines, the then-British colony of Sierra Leone was important to the war effort in both world wars. In World War I, the Royal West African Frontier Force served in operations against German forces in then-Togoland. In World War II, the strategic location of the port of Freetown meant it was fortified and became a critical base for protecting sea routes to the Middle East, India, and Australasia.

The vast majority of these forces were native Africans, many of them Sierra Leonean. Sierra Leoneans served as soldiers in the Frontier Force, and an even larger number served in the Carrier Corps. Combat in the African interior relied on vast quantities of materiel, but a lack of roads and mechanization meant that often the only effective method of transport was on the heads of the Carrier Corps.

Sierra Leonean forces saw combat from East Africa to Italy, and faced a grim death toll. Besides death in combat, many hundreds died of sicknesses including dysentery, tuberculosis, and especially malaria. The Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery honors soldiers who died during service in World War II. The cemetery contains the graves of 70 West African and four British soldiers.]]></summary>

How many flies got to live out the rest of their limited days on Earth in a habitat as temperate and well-attended as my pre-war apartment? Its constant buzzing, especially near my face, was annoying, and a part of me blanched each time my eyes strayed from my food, opening up the possibility for the fly to regurgitate its fly juice on my avocado toast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six months out, the 2025 NBA Draft is primarily conceived of and talked about as the Cooper Flagg draft. This makes a certain degree of sense, as Flagg is a huge destroyer who has been kicking ass for Duke and looking every bit like the sort of prospect who could push NBA defense forward, someone without precedent (in draftese, he's been "demonstrating the myriad ways he affects winning.") But you don't need to be a basketball alien to be cool. Dylan Harper is a hyperskilled operator, the man widely projected to be selected one pick after Flagg, and the most magnetic player in college basketball.
Where Flagg is a somewhat idiosyncratic player, causing open confusion among NBA execs, there's zero uncertainty about the sort of professional Harper will be. He is the consummate modern point guard, someone who looks like he is playing at a pro level already. I don't really understand how college defenders are supposed to guard someone who is 6-foot-6 with a plus-four wingspan and this advanced of a ball-handler with both hands. Harper is the ideal driver, gliding both past and through defenders, who always appear to be flailing like used-car inflatable dancing guys in contrast to Harper's perfect balance. He's also shooting 36 percent from three—not an eye-popping number, but his mechanics are clean, not to mention beautiful, and that figure includes a ton of self-created step-back stuff and his recent hot stretch of 46 percent over the past four games. Harper had his big moment this past weekend, when he nailed a buzzer-beating three to down Seton Hall in an extremely competitive game.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Excellent five-minute short video from the ever-insightful Kirby Ferguson for The New York Times, exploring why everything looks the same, sounds the same, and seemingly is the same in today’s pop culture. The short answer: that sameness is only pervasive when you only look at what’s promoted by our three-headed social media hegemony (Meta, YouTube, and TikTok).

 For decades, surfers and eco-tourists filled planes to Central America’s most popular travel destination, but food-focused travelers have found lots to love in Costa Rica’s waters and jungles, too. The country’s various microclimates steadily funnel a bounty of seafood and produce into the bustling capital of San José, where ingredients make their way into casados (smorgasbords of rice, beans, meat, salad, and more), bocas (bar snacks), and vibrant seafood specialties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stove hot! Specifically, Yankees stove hot, which is good for the current state of Yankees fan cope. While it remains impossible to rebuild Juan Soto in the aggregate, "Now we can afford to sign multiple guys" is at least starting to pan out as true, if not necessarily in the hitting department. Of course, this blog is not about Juan Soto.
Last week, the Yankees signed free agent Max Fried to an eight-year, $218 million contract. This at least covered the record-breaking portion of rebuilding Soto's contract in the aggregate, though instead of the more straightforward "biggest contract in MLB history," it came with the qualifiers of being the largest guarantee for a left-handed pitcher. Also like Soto's contract, the contract has a large risk of being player-friendly toward the end—Soto will be 41 when his runs out; Fried is currently 30 with a spotty injury history—but the Yankees front office, like the Mets', will only cry about the final years if the team doesn't make some deep runs in the first few.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN, I’ve been working on this multiplayer crossword for a while now. There’s still so much more on my todo list for it, but I think it’s time to launch and get some feedback with what I have.
Every hour, a new crossword (13×13 or 15×15) is generated at https://crosswordracing.com If you prefer smaller/faster, every ten minutes, a new mini crossword (7×7 or 11×11) is generated at https://crosswordracing.com/mini
You’re playing each crossword at the same time as everyone else, racing to complete it first. You can’t see what you’ve got right, until you correctly complete the entire grid. But you get some fun feedback on what other players are doing: a cell turns green if one other player has correctly solved it, orange if two other players have, and red if three or more other players have entered the correct letter in that cell.
Chat is emoji-only for the first half of the game (i.e. 30 minutes for the front-page, 5 minutes for the mini). After that, it unlocks and you can chat freely.
If you’re not done when the next crossword is generated, you can just stay on the current page for as long as you like and keep working to solve it.
I didn’t manage to get user accounts done before my arbitrarily-imposed launch date, so everyone is anonymous for now. I definitely want to build accounts, streaks, trophies, etc. The other big thing I’m excited to build is a “team mode”. You should be able to play on a team, where you can chat freely with your team-mates, and the cell colors indicate what the other team has (collaboratively) got correct. I think that would be a lot of fun.
Thanks for reading, checking it out, and for any feedback. Feel free to ask me anything, of course.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I honestly hate freelancing because it often feels unclear and stressful when starting new jobs, especially when employers aren’t sure what they want.
For the past few years, I’ve focused on specific projects like mobile chat apps using Flutter. With my existing codebase and experience, these jobs are easier and less stressful. I usually sell my codebase and move on.
However, finding these types of jobs is challenging. I tried many Upwork alert apps, but they either don’t work well or have over 95% false positives.
That’s why I created UpHunt. With UpHunt, you can create multiple profiles, and AI will match your profiles with Upwork jobs. You’ll receive instant notifications and can be the first to apply.
It's still a completely free project. I just need to hear your thoughts and feedback!

But nobody is just looking at their record. Injuries, a lack of depth, a weak offensive line, and an uncharacteristically flat offense have all combined to make this one of the least-impressive one-loss teams in memory. But wins are all that matters, and when the playoffs start the most important thing for the Chiefs will be that they have the best quarterback in football, who has found a way to win when it counts, even when it requires a little demon magic along the way. Everyone has been waiting for this football team to finally implode, but it hasn't happened yet, and they still have Patrick Mahomes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We created autonomous AI Agents that monitor the stock market for you while you go about your day.
How it works:
Tell our AI Assistant what you want to monitor, and it creates a project for our team of autonomous AI Agents. You'll get notifications (email + app) when significant events matching your criteria are detected. For short-term projects, you'll be notified when your analysis is ready.
Behind the scenes:
When you give the AI Assistant a request to monitor an entity (like a stock or group of stocks), an AI Project Manager plans the project and breaks the project down into manageable tasks. These tasks run asynchronously - some recurring (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly), others one-time.
Example prompts you can try:
Long-term monitoring:
- "Monitor Apple stock and notify me of any important events and red flags"
- "Monitor Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta stock. Notify me if any of them start trending toward being undervalued"
Short-term analysis:
- "Create a project to analyze the last 30 earnings calls for Tesla, spot trends, and how the business has evolved over time"
You can track the progress of all tasks as the AI Agents work in the background.
Try it here: https://decodeinvesting.com/chat
This is still an early version - we're actively improving it based on feedback. Would love to hear what you think and what features you'd want to see next!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN,
We’re excited to share PySpur, an open-source tool that provides a graph-based interface for building, debugging, and evaluating LLM workflows.
Why we built this:
Before this, we built several LLM-powered applications that collectively served thousands of users. The biggest challenge we faced was ensuring reliability: making sure the workflows were robust enough to handle edge cases and deliver consistent results.
In practice, achieving this reliability meant repeatedly:
1. Breaking down complex goals into simpler steps: Composing prompts, tool calls, parsing steps, and branching logic.  
2. Debugging failures: Identifying which part of the workflow broke and why.  
3. Measuring performance: Assessing changes against real metrics to confirm actual improvement.
We tried some existing observability tools or agent frameworks and they fell short on at least one of these three dimensions. We wanted something that allowed us to iterate quickly and stay focused on improvement rather than wrestling with multiple disconnected tools or code scripts.
We eventually arrived at three principles upon which we built PySpur :
1. Graph-based interface: We can lay out an LLM workflow as a node graph. A node can be an LLM call, a function call, a parsing step, or any logic component. The visual structure provides an instant overview, making complex workflows more intuitive.  
2. Integrated debugging: When something fails, we can pinpoint the problematic node, tweak it, and re-run it on some test cases right in the UI.   
3. Evaluate at the node level: We can assess how node changes affect performance downstream.
We hope it's useful for other LLM developers out there, enjoy!

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42433683</id>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been on the job hunt for the past few months and after going through numerous reddit threads and Linkedin posts I saw that customized resumes make a huge difference in getting callbacks. But every tool I tried was either bloated with 50+ features I didn’t need or way too expensive (some were charging $70/month!). These people think I'm made of money!
So I decided to build my own AI resume builder.
It’s simple and streamlined:
It takes your resume and the job post and generates  a custom resume tailored to that post. (We do not store your resume or use it to train the AI)
What used to take me 20-30 minutes now takes 30 seconds.
I’ve gotten callbacks from companies like Apple, Nvidia, Meta, and Amazon using it.
The pricing is designed to be accessible: the more jobs you apply to, the cheaper it gets — around $2 per resume.
I'd love for you to try it out and let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Barcelona is one of the most visited cities in the world—and given its abundance of urban beaches, cultural institutions, and striking Gaudí-designed masterpieces, justifiably so. But while the city is famous for its restaurants, much of what makes its cuisine so unique has been lost in the rush of international brands and blandly Spanish dining concepts meant to appeal to tourists and digital nomads.

To this day, Barcelona’s identity is tied to Catalonia, a semi-autonomous region with its own language, culture, anthem, and gastronomy. Despite being part of Spain for well over five centuries, Catalan people are still fiercely proud of their own distinct traditions. When it comes to the food, that means here you’ll encounter dishes combining meat and seafood (as well as meat and fruit) fo…]]></summary>

Smash burgers are a menu slam dunk. Is that a good thing?
 I can’t remember the last time I saw a burger that didn’t have a lacy edge. I know they still exist out there, half-pound bistro burgers oozing with juice, but these are not the burgers that trend, the burgers that beckon obsession on TikTok. No, the burgers I am told I want are meaty doilies, pressed nearly paper thin, ground beef fried to a crisp.
Over the past five years or so, smash burgers have grown in national popularity. But 2024 was the year they officially peaked — and maybe jumped the shark. A genuine creativity around incorporating new flavors into smash burgers has made the inevitable turn into a mandatory menu addition for every place that is trying to be the next big thing.

Orders from last week started going out over the weekend, and hundreds more are shipping today.
It’s too late now to get an order in for Christmas, no matter where you live, but it’s not too late to place an order from this batch of shirts and hoodies. But, we’ll probably close the store to new orders tomorrow (Tuesday), so don’t wait. My sincere thanks to everyone who’s bought one (or in many cases, more than one).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Malmö harbor, a cone-shaped concrete relic of World War II-era architecture rises above the former dockyard like a giant vertical cigar: the Spetsbunker, a towering 60-foot (18-meter) bomb shelter. 

The bunker’s construction around 1940 solved a significant challenge for the nearby then-bustling shipyard: the waterlogged, unstable ground made underground shelters impractical. Designed to protect up to 150 workers, the structure, however, ultimately went unused, as Sweden remained largely untouched by the war.

While relatively common in wartime Germany, this type of above-ground bunker is believed to be the only one of its kind in Sweden. Drawing on the pioneering work of engineer Leo Winkel, known for creating Winkeltürme (“Winkel Towers”) or Spitzbunker (“Pointed Bunkers”), the structure embodies both functionality and creativity. 

The air raid shelter’s tall, narrow, circular base, with a metal-reinforced pointed top, was crafted to be nearly invisible to enemy bombers and exceptionally difficult to destroy. Even a direct hit would cause the payload to glance off the surface, rather than penetrating the walls.

Overgrown with vines, the Spetsbunker remains a stoic sentinel. Though closed to the public, its weathered interior features a spiral staircase, platforms, and a central shaft with a winch. Its distinctive silhouette continues to serve as both a historical landmark and a reminder of wartime innovation.]]></summary>

 With all the chaos of the holiday season swirling, it’s not a surprise that you’re online right now trying to find a gift for someone in your life. There’s a lot going on this time of year, and a trip to the mall definitely won’t make you feel any less stressed out about getting everything checked off your to-do list.
But there is a foolproof solution that doesn’t involve making a frantic, last-minute shopping trip: just give the recipient you have in mind a really great food subscription box. It’s both an easy gift and a win-win: Your recipient gets to open a present multiple times over the course of the next year, and you’ll also save yourself several headaches by jumping online and ordering something to be shipped directly to their door instead of fight…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So it's agreed, then: The only Super Bowl that America should demand after the year we've all had is Bills-Lions. It has all the elements we think we deserve—points, absurd plays, points, easily caricatured main characters, points, long-to-the-point-of-seemingly-interminable-suffering fan bases, points, a coach who wants all his linemen to have touchdowns, more points, another coach who has been slagged repeatedly for not reaching let alone winning the big one, additional points, the MVP and the Coach Of The Year if you're into that sort of thing, further points, towns that fight the odds just by getting out of bed every day, another round of points, drunks jumping through furniture, and one final round of points.
Now comes the hard part, which is coming to grips with the likelihood that we likely won't get Bills-Lions again, and having the fortitude and dignity to refuse to watch whatever matchup the National Football League tries to pretend we'd rather have instead. In other words, if it ain't Bills-Lions, we must cancel the parties, refuse to get dressed on game day, and hate-watch the Puppy Bowl instead. If we can't get it together to do the right thing in November, we may as well give it an honest go in February.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nestled in central Morocco’s rugged landscapes, the Ahouli Mines have a rich history as a hub of mineral production. The French company Penarroya initiated the mining operations in 1927. From 1928 to the 1960s, these mines yielded tens of thousands of tons of lead annually, employing hundreds of workers who extracted resources from dynamite-blasted tunnels—an industrial technique now banned in Morocco.

At about 1.5 kilometers from the entrance, the main tunnel splits into two and narrow shafts dart off in several directions, with ladders and pulleys connecting to shafts at shallower and deeper levels. There are also some larger chambers used for storing disused trolleys, mining tools, and basic amenities for the miners, including a makeshift shower. An ominous red metal door is locked wi…]]></summary>

Ever since ChatGPT came out, I've been using it to debate and learn new ideas. Having a short insightful conversation where AI coaches you can be powerful but it's hard to get right with a general purpose chat LLM because they don't propose stories, lack context and don't track progression
I'm building Socratify with the hypothesis that a product built around AI questioning humans and proposing interesting questions daily can be 100x more rewarding than book summaries and other passive content.
Inspired by Charlie Munger's concept of a latticework of models that you apply to new situation. Socratify teaches you a concept (e.g., Disruption), discusses a situation where it's applicable, (e.g., Google vs. Perplexity) and gives you feedback as well as the strongest counterargument
Checkout the first release at https://www.socratify.com/
Appreciate thoughts from the HN community and would love to learn what you would want from an AI coach that makes you better every day

If you are looking to impress a tea friend or matcha enthusiast, this is the matcha I would suggest. It toes the line between being fancy and flavorful without having an appalling price tag. Its deep green hue is an indicator of the high-quality matcha each tin provides, but if that doesn’t convince you, the aroma — and flavor — will. This matcha is rich, floral, and subtly sweet but rounded out by mild bitterness. It’s delicious drunk straight because the matcha is already so smooth, but I also find it adds the perfect earthy bite to matcha lattes. I love to pair it with warm milk and a drizzle of vanilla bean paste for a fragrant matcha latte that is arguably better than any of the pale, $8 versions you might order at a coffee shop. One warning: Once you try this matcha, you can never go back to the cheaper stuff (nor will you want to, anyway).



No peeking! But check out what the Eater Advent Calendar has already revealed.  And check back each day for a new clutch condiment, gadget, or nibble that, yes, makes an amazing gift — but these surprises are just for you.]]></summary>

I Introduce a library of type-safe URL builder that can be used in the Blazor project.
Blazor is a cool technology that makes it easy for anyone to write modern web in C#, but I found it lacking in features around URLs.
Similar projects already exist, but this library is
* Compatible with razor's source generator (the previous one had to explicitly turn this off with the advent of .NET6)
* Automatic generation of @page, [Parameter], and [CounterWithQuery] attributes (handwriting is very tedious, right?)
* Automatic generation of highly customizable menu structures (icons, descriptions, L10N, all possible!)
Happy hacking!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Conclave, currently playing both in theaters and on demand, is the kind of movie that will generate almost all of its long-term business from its ending. Yes, it will be nominated for, and perhaps win, a whole shitload of Oscars. And yes, DOP Stephane Fontaine’s camerawork deserves one of those Oscars. If you want two hours of sumptuous Vatican porn (and the mood strikes me more often than you’d imagine), Fontaine and director Edward Berger deliver a movie with multiple frames that are literally suitable for framing. Put those shots in a fucking museum.
But that ain’t what anyone’s gonna talk about coming out of the theater. What everyone is gonna talk about is, “Oh wow, can you believe that ending?” And if you haven’t seen it Conclave yet, you’ll be besieged by satisfied customers encouraging you to experience its endgame for yourself. We’re still in the Spoiler Zone for this film, so I can’t and won't talk more about how Conclave’s plot resolves itself. Nor do I want to, because my opinion—and it’s only mine—is that it was corny and stupid.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a kind of hush that is specific to old-growth suburbs, a quietness that is more vast and more inherent than any disturbance that kind of place can kick up. The place where I grew up is different in some ways than it was when I was growing up there, but that fundamental quiet is undisturbed. Things happen and make their various sounds—you'll hear a quick blurt of music when someone steps out of a bar to smoke or as people come and go from one of the restaurants downtown, cars go by and dogs get bossy on their walks and freight trains chug and honk over the New Jersey Transit lines when the commuter trains aren't running. People still live there, and people make noise. The part that is striking, and which is striking to me whenever I go back to see my parents in the house where I grew up, is how the totality of that suburban quiet swallows all this up. It's there and then it is gone, and there is maybe the wind in the trees or just nothing at all.
I have lived in noisy places for longer than I ever lived in all that quiet, but the appeal of it isn't lost on me. I like how dark it gets at night there, and I like walking back from the train station down those quiet sidewalks and through all the old extraneous shortcuts of my youth. The last few times I've done this I have startled some deer standing around in a parking lot, as aimless and wary as I was when I did the same thing as a teenager; they stared at me but did not run. I am aware that it is a nice place to live and it was on balance a perfectly fine place to grow up. I understand why people live there. I am also under no illusions about how quickly and how thoroughly I would go insane if I were to try to do it again.]]></summary>

Joy in Marriages with ADHD

Date night!
We all love the concept.  But I hear many complaints from non-ADHD partners that they are tired of being in charge of date night.  Their ADHD partner 'never seems to get around to planning any.'  I get the disappointment, though I also push back sometimes and suggest that those with the executive functioning skillset might be well-suited to doing that planning if they don't take the lack of involvement from the ADHD personally.
However, here is another approach that might get a bit more attention from ADHD partners - Alphabet Date Night.  I ran into this concept online and loved it immediately because it's so FUN!  It also hits on two ADHD motivational strengths - gamification and 'new'.  
The idea is that you cycle through the alphabet selecting dates that start with different letters of the alphabet to keep things fresh.  Only use any given letter once in a 26-date cycle.  Some examples:
A


apple picking
alpacas (at the zoo)
aquarium
art exhibit
B
basketball game
basket exhibit
boating/boats
biking
beach
C
car show
cycling
cat bar (where you have lunch with cats - yes, it's a thing)
cooking (together; take a class; go to a cooking shop and pick out one thing for your kitchen)
comedy (movie; club; take an improv class together)
You get the idea.  You can look up lists of alphabet dates online...or you can have the fun of making your own.  Post it online in a joint document or on a bulletin board somewhere in your house and add to it as you think of new ideas.
So much fun!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In accordance with New York Athletic Club bylaws, any defensive player who wins the Heisman must be a dual threat player: one who also takes enough snaps on offense to remind voters of the QBs and RBs those voters like to vote for, and who normally win this award. That’s how legendary Michigan CB Charles Woodson secured the Heisman in 1997 (over betting favorite Peyton Manning), and it’s how Colorado CB/WR Travis Hunter edged out Boise State RB Ashton Jeanty for the honor on Saturday night. Hunter is even more of an offensive threat than Woodson was, amassing 92 receptions and 1,152 yards on offense this season while also serving as the Buffaloes’ shutdown corner. This man is a special talent, and the NFL Draft will reward him for it.
Now let’s talk about Hunter’s coach, who’s a total asshole.]]></summary>
