        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's fun to speculate about bad team chemistry. Sometimes the sideline body language is revealing enough. Sometimes you get an uncharacteristically detailed and cogent Shams Charania report, like the one the Sixers suffered last week. Sometimes you can figure it out in the circuitous sentences of beat reporters, who are too polite or compromised to say it outright. And sometimes it can be deduced from the mere presence of Rudy Gobert, a man so unpopular among his colleagues that ESPN tried to learn why at feature length. Even as the team around him has changed, Gobert is still Gobert, with charisma about as strong as his low-post repertoire.
This offseason's trade between the Knicks and Wolves was, in some ways, trading like for like. One offensively gifted, sporadically infuriating big man was swapped for another, Julius Randle to Minnesota and Karl-Anthony Towns to New York. All things considered, the Towns-Gobert pairing was a pretty successful experiment, schematically and interpersonally. But Randle is a bit more dour than the man he was replacing. Gobert-Randle had tremendous grump-on-grump potential, and we're starting to see it, eight wins and seven losses into a Wolves campaign against a very soft slate of opponents.]]></summary>

In other words, he's messing around with the All-Star Game.
Credit to him for trying, anyway. Silver is nothing if not persistent, and at his pay grade as commissioner of your National Basketball Association, he'd damned well better be. He is already being given credit for the largely illusory benefits of the in-season tournament, which is mostly just a tribute to schedule manipulation (good games between good teams are always that, Emirates branding be damned), some gym floor murals by 12-year-olds with an unlimited supply of spray paint, and a trophy nobody has any particular attachment to. But Silver does understand that customers will buy anything they can be fooled into thinking is worth the attention span. The challenge, where the All-Star Game is concerned, is that no one is fooled.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As fans in America, it's important to remain grateful for the ease with which we can indulge a truly gluttonous appetite for elite soccer, our consumption unshackled from the regional restrictions, splintered broadcast rights, and timezone issues that make it much more difficult for everyone else to watch as much of the best teams and leagues as we can. That being said, I do regret the fact that it's recently become a lot harder to keep up with the international game stateside.
For a couple years now I've spent most midseason international breaks spotting tasty UEFA Nations League matchups and CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifiers on the schedule, only to learn that watching them would require expanding my already bloated streaming service subscriptions to divorce-threatening levels. I'm about as motivated a soccer fan as there is, and yet even I refuse to stump up for the Fubos and Vixes and Fox Soccer Pluses of the world, especially when you can't even rely on those services to air every match in the competitions they have the rights to. It's gotten to the point where I've now all but given up even thinking about catching non-tournament national team games.]]></summary>

This is all fair, although to be frank, Michaels has seen everything a thousand times during his long career; it would be not just weird but worrying if he was hooting and hollering over the ordinary nonsense like some unhinged post-Ritalin Kevin Harlan. It’s just the Jaguars on a weeknight, and also the man just turned 80.
But Thursday night's Steelers-Browns game, a blizzard that happened to feature yard lines and penalty flags, turned Michaels absolutely giddy. The ultimate broadcasting lifer became your 7-year-old on Christmas morning, full of wonder and delight and processed sugar, tucking into his gig as if every play was a hunk of prime rib with a double-baked tater the size of your spaniel's head and a Balvenie on the side, neat—all fed to him forkful by straining forkful by Jane Fonda circa Barbarella.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since it was first announced in December 2012, the feature film adaptation of the wildly popular musical Wicked, itself an adaptation of the incredibly strange Gregory Maguire novel, has been beset by delays. First, there were eight years in development hell, easily enough to kill most films. Then there was a pandemic. Nearly a decade had passed since the initial announcement by the time Jon M. Chu took over as director in 2021, fresh off In The Heights and Crazy Rich Asians. By the end of the year, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande were cast as the green and pink protagonists, respectively. In April 2022, Chu posted a note sent from his “OzPhone” on Twitter that read, in part, “As we prepared the production over the last year, it became impossible to wrestle the story of 'Wicked' into a single film without doing some real damage to it":
As we tried to cut songs or trim characters, those decisions began to feel like fatal compromises to the source material that has entertained us all for so many years. We decided to give ourselves a bigger canvas and make not just one 'Wicked' movie but two! With more space, we can tell the story of 'Wicked' as it was meant to be told while bringing even more depth and surprise to the journeys for these beloved characters.]]></summary>

The dreams were in sequence: two parts of a single story that were braided together. A single day of my life became the intermission. Everyone thinks their dreams are interesting. We are self-involved creatures, infatuated with the shiny pictures our subconscious makes for us and presents like a movie in the mere seconds before our brains return to the living. But the week before the election, my subconscious gave me something special. 
In the dream, the moon was shrinking. I was staring up at the sky while it swirled around and around, becoming smaller and smaller, orbiting around nothing, counterclockwise in an oval like it was going around a race track. And just when it became too small to really see, it became larger and larger and larger and larger. It was coming toward us, falling, plummeting into the Earth's atmosphere. And then I woke up. The whole next day, I read about the moon. I researched what would happen if the moon fell (we would all die). I tried to understand how big the moon actually is (very big). Of course, it returned to my dreams the next night. In the sequel, the moon was lost. The moon had plummeted into the Pacific Ocean, and we could not find it.

Christmas simply is when and where it is; Christmas season surrounds it in some more subjective but necessarily limited ways.

There are childhood memories that linger in your soul for no discernible reason, and here is one of mine. I was six years old. I was living in Chicago, and playing on a Mites-level youth hockey team. I have no memory of whether or not I was a good hockey player. This was the level of youth sports where you’re essentially dressing up as an athlete without being one yet. You put on your equipment, you skate onto the ice, you do what the coach tells you until you don’t feel like doing it anymore, and then you dick around like the kid you are. A slightly more organized playdate. I remember my skates being super tight, I remember being taught how to loosely stick handle the puck, and I remember my pads smelling like a cadaver after I’d taken them off. The rest is a haze.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At every stage of his career, Christian Pulisic has always relished playing for the USMNT. When he was a boy wonder at Borussia Dortmund, it was by scoring a ton of goals in the U.S.'s failed efforts to qualify for the 2018 World Cup that he introduced himself to the country and legitimized himself as more than just the next Julian Green. When he was alternating between sitting on the Chelsea bench due to injuries and sitting on the Chelsea bench because he'd slipped down the pecking order, getting to come and bang in CONCACAF was a way to rebuild his confidence. And now that he's in the form of his life for AC Milan, rounding into his prime by playing a huge role for a team competing for domestic and continental honors, his play with the USMNT feels equally expansive and ambitious. This is the best Christian Pulisic we've ever seen, a prospect that is equal parts encouraging and annoying.
The headlining event came in Monday night's huge win against Jamaica—where Captain America grabbed two goals in a thrilling 4-2 victory—though Pulisic built the foundation for that big performance by killing it for Milan all season. With Rafael Leão holding down Pulisic's preferred left wing position, the American has split his time in Italy this season between setting things up as a central attacking midfielder and ripping down the right wing. And rip he has: Pulisic leads Milan in Serie A goals and assists, and he's scored against Liverpool and gotten an assist against Real Madrid in the Champion's League. Milan has been slightly off the pace in Serie A this year, mostly because their backline has been somewhat wobbly and the new coach wasn't getting along with Leão, the club's best player. Throughout it all, though, Pulisic has been flying.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Augusta Britt has had, by any reasonable accounting, an extraordinarily rich and interesting life, and seems like a vivid and fascinating person. By her mid-teens in the mid-1970s, she was a pistol-packing Arizona refugee from her own abusive family and any number of atrocious foster homes. She met the novelist Cormac McCarthy by a motel pool in 1976 when she was 16 (and he 42) and became, for the next few years, his secret lover as well as, for the next four decades, the pretty direct inspiration for many of his stories and characters.
When she was 17—and McCarthy, Britt would find out later, was still married to Annie DeLisle—the two ran off to Mexico believing (or fantasizing) that the FBI was after McCarthy on statutory rape and human trafficking charges; they returned to the U.S. shortly after her 18th birthday. In 1981, when she would have been 21 or thereabouts, she left McCarthy in Tennessee and returned to Arizona. They saw each other many times over the following decades and kept up a deep correspondence for the rest of his life, but never lived together again; he asked her to marry him two separate times but backed out of both proposals. Britt has spent time as a patient in a mental hospital; she has worked as a trauma nurse; she is richly thoughtful about her unique life; now, at 64, she still trains horses and shoots guns, and evidently taught McCarthy much of what he learned about both hobbies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to reporting from The Athletic's resident football pot-stirrer Dianna Russini and co-conspirator Zack Rosenblatt, we now realize that Aaron Rodgers is only partly to blame for the New York Jets being the latest iteration of the New York Jets—and yes, everyone knows what that means. Their recent reporting reveals that superannuated yet still overmatched owner Woody Johnson has also stamped his footprint right in the middle of the mudslide which led yesterday to the firing of general manager Joe Douglas, only six weeks after he fired head coach Robert Saleh. What was already a typically Jetsy situation has only continued to get more Jetsy.
Now, the report could just be an act of reputational sanitation on Rodgers’ behalf, although that scale of clean-up job would require more than a double byline, plus we have no evidence that either author is particularly keen on Rodgers one way or another. According to Rosenblatt and Russini (we're switching billboard credits because we don't know who did more heavy lifting on this), Woody broached the subject of benching Rodgers for backup quarterback Tyrod Taylor earlier this season, only to be talked off that particular comedic ledge by everyone else in the room. You may now talk among yourselves on the subject of whether Johnson might not be a genius, or just someone who has watched Rodgers closely this year. But frankly, everyone is ignoring the central fact, which is that no matter what the cast of characters shows, the Jets were the Jets and are the Jets, and because of Items 1 and 2, they shall always be the Jets. A benching or a firing or another firing or some future firing will not and cannot change that. The only thing for Jets employees to do at this point is to become ex-employees as quickly as possible. I mean, who on that payroll has got it better than Smilin' Bobby Saleh right now?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People hate Jake Paul. He is the walking personification of a Reddit board: a cocky, belligerent white boy who loves to troll as much as he loves to use mental health issues as marketing. His transition from YouTube provocateur to "serious" "boxer" has been built on the calculated decision to fight washed-up black athletes. It’s smart; boxing has always thrived when catering to the public imagination around race war. The desire to see Paul get knocked out by one of the faded avatars of black masculinity he sets himself against explains much of the draw of his fights. His savvy protection of that appeal explains why he only fights people he can comfortably beat with his young legs and just-about-competent skills.
When it was first announced that Paul planned to fight a 58-year-old Mike Tyson, the initial response was one of widespread incredulousness. Over time, people seemed to convince themselves that somehow a geriatric Tyson could be the one to finally put Jake Paul “in his place,” whatever that might mean. It always made sense why Paul would want to fight an old Mike Tyson. But what exactly was in it for Tyson? Money, surely, but that can’t be the only reason. This is a man in his late 50s, who’d been mostly retired since the early 2000s. The people who got suckered into caring about this fight didn't want to see that reality, transposing instead an image of the Mike Tyson of yore, maybe older and slower in some vague way, but still in possession of the exhilarating, terrifying power and violence that made him a legend. On some level, maybe Tyson wanted to see that too.]]></summary>

Mammoth tusk collectors trawl the ice for tusks and other bones poking out from the melting permafrost, but occasionally they stumble on bodies that have been frozen for tens of thousands of years. In 2017 and 2018, tusk collectors found two mummified cave lion cubs, a species that has been extinct for thousands of years and likely resembled modern lions. In 2020, a tusk collector unearthed another, even rarer ancient kitten: a frozen saber-toothed cat cub, as Asher Elbein reported in The New York Times.
Despite their presence in our prehistorical imaginings—such as a starring role in the Ice Age franchise—the actual soft-tissue appearance of saber-toothed cats remained a mystery to scientists. So this new cub offers the first-ever glimpse at how the cats appeared in real life, about 35,000 to 37,000 years ago. The term saber-toothed cat refers to a plethora of cat-like species with elongated teeth, and the most famous—and perhaps most extravagantly toothed—belonged to the genus Smilodon. Scientists identified the new cub as Homotherium latidens, a species in another genus that contained the "scimitar-toothed cats," as these cats had curved canines that were smaller than Smilodon's. The researchers' paper describing the new kitten was recently published in Scientific Reports.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Laura Helmuth was named editor-in-chief of Scientific American in March 2020, shortly before the magazine was set to celebrate its 175th year in print. Helmuth, who had previously directed health and science coverage at The Washington Post, told Poynter it was her dream job: "I love this magazine. It’s been around forever ... and I want to make it even more influential.”
Last week, after four-and-a-half years at the helm of the oldest continuously published magazine in the United States, Helmuth resigned. She made this decision shortly after a series of posts on Bluesky in which she called Trump voters "fucking fascists." Helmuth later deleted the posts, but screenshots wound their way to Twitter, where Elon Musk weighed in, leading to a wave of online harassment. It's unclear what exactly prompted Helmuth's resignation, but it's hard not to connect the dots. Helmuth did not respond to a request for comment.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not much for nicknames, though occasionally a moniker so good emerges that it becomes the only way I can think about a player. Atlanta's Australian ballhawk Dyson Daniels has earned such a nickname: the Great Barrier Thief. In his first season with the Hawks, the 21-year-old Daniels is starting for the first time and, as such, is having a breakout season. It's always fun when a young, promising player is given their first chance at a big role, because all that newfound responsibility is a much stronger test of their abilities; there's so much talent in the league right now that surely each team has several players who could do more if given more opportunity. Daniels has shown, through 13 games with the Hawks, that he is one of the best defensive playmakers in the NBA.
Daniels is currently leading the league with 3.4 steals per game; his 91 deflections are a whopping 34 more than second-placed De'Aaron Fox. Daniels is averaging 4.7 steals every 100 possessions, the highest such figure since Nate McMillan, the guy who coached the Hawks for some of last season, did it in 1993–94 for the Seattle Supersonics, who don't exist anymore. Daniels recently put together an unholy four-game streak of six or more steals per game, and he has recorded a steal in every single game except for Monday night's win against the Fox's Sacramento Kings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's no reason why a sudden, unplanned team meeting has to be a bad thing. Maybe it's a good thing! Maybe your veteran teammate is calling the team meeting, immediately after the conclusion of a road game, because he wants to shower someone in much-deserved attention, or to announce that he just got a great deal on car insurance. You can't know until you have attended the meeting. Best not to burden yourself with anxiety. Best to go into the meeting expecting it to be happy and celebratory.
Kyle Lowry, veteran guard for the Philadelphia 76ers, did not recently get a great deal on car insurance, or if he did, that was not why he called Monday's meeting. The 76ers had just played listlessly and disjointedly and had their butts pretty thoroughly hacked off by the Miami Heat, their fourth consecutive loss, dropping their record to a league-worst 2–11. It was Lowry's impression that the team—which if healthy and united should very reasonably expect to make another playoff run—needed to clear the air and share "a call to action and urgency," as sources described it to ESPN's Shams Charania.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Administrators at Hayfield Secondary School in Alexandria, Va., set out late last year to create a football powerhouse. The principal and athletic director, both new to the school, recruited the coach from Freedom High School, a school located in a neighboring county that had claimed the state title the previous two seasons and was in the Top 40 nationally. One high school poaching a football coach from another isn't all that noteworthy, unless, as in this case, all his top players and coaching staff come with him.
Basically, the best team in the state was invited to just change its address and uniforms and get back to whipping everybody's ass. And they accepted. It's been all ugliness ever since. Hayfield put together the most talked-about schoolboy football juggernaut to hit Alexandria since the 1971 team at T.C. Williams, the squad that inspired the Remember the Titans. This ain't the feel-good drama that one was, however. The administration's pre-fab superteam scheme fell into place so fast and was so successful—the Hawks went 9-0 with a scoring differential of 563-13 against other public schools—that it produced multiple investigations for rule-breaking, a postseason ban, lawsuits, and an 11th-hour court injunction. In between all of that was a whole bunch of uncompetitive football.]]></summary>

About a decade ago, a team traveling from the East into the Golden State would have to duel three Cup contenders in quick succession: Los Angeles, Anaheim, and San Jose. But now, as both the Ducks and Sharks slog through a stretched-out rebuild and the Kings haven't won a playoff series since 2014, the trip's most intimidating foe is jetlag. Nevertheless, the Detroit Red Wings still spent a long weekend finding a way to lose all three meetings, dropping themselves into a precarious early-season position that already threatens to extend their postseason drought to nine years.
The Ducks game to open the trip was the most frustrating, as a 3-1 Detroit lead near the end of the second evaporated into a 6-4 defeat. In the back-to-back against the Kings, head coach Derek Lalonde's boys sleepwalked to a 4-1 loss. In San Jose on Monday, the team salvaged one point thanks to an effective power play that helped get the game to overtime, but still left the building as losers on account of No. 1 overall pick Macklin Celebrini's knockout blow at three-on-three.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You never actually hear a metaphorical window close. For starters, the window in question is metaphorical; for another, that kind of window doesn't open up and down as you might imagine it, but in and out. That way, it can open and close with a gust of ill wind or a burst of good fortune. The transparency of it might make you think the window is not just wide open but a glass door that leads out to the backyard pool and allows the largest of mesomorphs easy passage. Approach with too much confidence and you might walk right into it that way, and your insurance won't cover the cost of the dentist having to pull glass out of your gums.
We don't know if the San Francisco 49ers' six-year window of Super Bowl contendership is finally closed, but it certainly has a totally unjustified sense of closing soon. They just feel too ordinary for one to care about in that way.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's nothing quite like an exciting Sunday Night Football game. After a day of sitting on the couch mainlining RedZone, it's a nice, healthy step-down to sit back and enjoy just one game in the moment. If that game delivers, then all the better. There have been some fun ones this season, even as recently as last weekend with the Jared Goff interceptionpalooza. But for my money, Sunday's match-up between the Chargers and Bengals was the best Sunday night game of the season. Both teams, at separate times and sometimes at the same time, looked like they were trying to gift the game away; this somehow only made the game itself more compelling. A battle of weaponized incompetence might not sound like riveting viewing, but both teams traded periods of dominance across 60 minutes, and the only reason really that the Chargers came out ahead 34-27 is that they choked just a bit less in the final quarter.
If you want to be more generous than that, the Chargers won because they executed one more time than the Bengals did in the fourth, but that would ignore how Los Angeles built up a comfortable 27-6 lead on the arm of Justin Herbert, only to abruptly and completely forget how to play defense. Let's start with Herbert, though, because he was absolutely dealing in the first half. Herbert completed his first six passes on the night for 123 yards and two TDs, the first of which was a beautiful laser down the seam to tight end Will Dissly. The second was even better, as Herbert took a wide bootleg right before swerving left and leaving his feet for a bullet to a wide open Quentin Johnson in the end zone:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no surprise that the Bills and the Chiefs played a high-stakes thriller that was decided when one of their quarterbacks made a spectacular play. But there was still no way, really, to be prepared for Buffalo QB Josh Allen's improv in the most nerve-wracking of spots—up two with just over two minutes to play, facing fourth-and-two on the KC 26. Fail to the gain the yards (or opt to kick a field goal), and the Bills would be handing the ball over to Patrick Mahomes with the opportunity for a game-winning two-minute drill. Instead, Allen seized the victory for himself by beating every Chiefs defender to the end zone.
Kansas City rushed four against Buffalo's five blockers, but Allen was still able to spot a crease in the defense as he stepped up in the pocket. With two wideouts going to the sticks on the right, and another target at the same distance on his left, there was just enough of an opening in the middle for Allen to acquire the yardage he needed. But he didn't stop there. Accelerating toward the goal line, he made one diving tackler fall helplessly at his heels, shrugged off another who tried to fly at his arm, and powered through safety Bryan Cook as he fell triumphantly into the blue paint. The Bills had their two-score lead, and the defense did their part to make the final line 30-21.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want to understand what makes De'Aaron Fox's game so effective and cool, the most important thing to understand is something of a signature Fox play: the surprise fast break. Several times per game, while the opposing team is in the process of setting up its halfcourt defense with obvious spatial and manpower advantages, Fox will see an opening and sprint with the ball directly into the heart of that defense, creating either a layup for himself or a wide open shot for a teammate. The sorts of gaps he pries open are not available to any other ball-handler on any other team, because nobody else in the NBA is as demon-quick as Fox, or as insistent on applying pressure in seemingly disadvantageous situations. 
You can apply the logic of the surprise fast break forward to explain the rest of his game, and as he showed over a historic weekend, the highest level of that game is startling.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Orlando Pride did not become the first team in NWSL history to collect 60 points for any one reason. On any given day, you could assign credit to Barbra Banda's attacking ferocity, Marta's ageless orchestration, or the league's stingiest defense. But in order to make it through an entire season with only two losses, you need the reliable presence of all three of those things, and more. Truly great teams are great as a matter of course. This is something that the Kansas City Current learned on Sunday, as they fell to the Pride, 3-2, in the league semifinal.
The final score conceals the convincing nature of Orlando's victory, which was claimed in the 82nd minute through an act of eye-watering beauty crafted by the best player in history. Everything that happened after Marta scored to give the Pride a 3-1 lead—16 minutes of stoppage time, the Current getting a goal back thanks to a fluky handball in the box, Banda leaving the game with an injury—may as well not have happened, because the game had already been defined for good by Marta's feat:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you'd asked me 20 years ago, I would have said confidently that Wayne Gretzky's NHL record of 894 career goals was unbreakable. It was a curio to be admired, not a number to be chased; like Cy Young's 511 wins, it came from a different era, almost a different sport entirely. If you'd asked me one year ago, when Alex Ovechkin was scuffling with five goals, which is all he'd still have even a month later, I'd have considered the chase a tragicomedy—an ancient Ovi, looking so washed up he should be talking to a volleyball, puttering his way through sad season after sad season, long after he should have retired, making his team worse. It would have been awful; it would have lessened both the record and Ovechkin's career. 
I'll extend myself some forgiveness for thinking it was over, that guys pushing 40 don't tend to have slumps, or at least not slumps that end. I would have done well to recall Ovechkin's quote from more than a decade ago, a sign that he probably stresses the least of anyone over his goalscoring droughts. "Right now I’m scoring goals and I’m the king of the world," he said. "And a couple weeks ago I was almost in the toilet. So maybe you just forget to flush me."]]></summary>
