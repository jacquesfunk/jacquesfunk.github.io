While Jason's new book—it's called Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, And Future Of Blizzard Entertainment, and comes out next week—will in some sense sell itself due to Schreier's status as a titan in his field and Blizzard's massive following, in another and more literal sense the guy still has to go out there and sell it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How fast the mighty fall, and timely, too. The Houston Astros' seven-year streak of reaching the ALCS ended the same night that the Atlanta Braves' six-year streak of reaching the NLDS did the same, and each in an unceremonious sweep—at least, as much as a sweep can be a sweep in a three-game postseason series. At the very least, the Milwaukee Brewers spared us an extra day without any postseason baseball by forcing a Game 3 against the Mets.
No sensible person will cry about these developments. The Astros are the Astros, and the Braves were a dead team walking even entering the playoffs; better they just be put out of their misery. Other than the overarching sentiment towards both teams' failings, conflating them is a bit misleading. The postseason record that the Astros strung together might be distasteful, but has to garner some level of respect: No other team has managed it. Meanwhile, "reaching the NLDS" can sound impressive when phrased that way, but even in the expanded playoffs, half the teams that reach a Divisional Series do it through the regular season.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's the absolute best kind of hit? A grand slam, you might say. I suppose, yeah, objectively, that's right. But after Andy Ibáñez knocked a bases-loaded double into the left corner pocket in the eighth inning of a tied Tigers-Astros game on Wednesday, Tigers fans might disagree. With the bases-clearing two-bagger, they received beat after beat of great news: the suspenseful declaration that the ball was fair, and then the dramatic build of an incrementally larger lead. "One run scores! ... Two runs score! ... Evvvvvverybody scores!" It was as good as it gets, and so was the rest of the afternoon for the Detroiters, as Houston went 1-2-3, 1-2-3 to eject themselves from the postseason barely 24 hours after it began.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here we are again. For most of Erik ten Hag's tenure at Manchester United, England's most storied club has been reeling. Though his first season, the 2022-23 edition, was a moderate success—third place in the Premier League and a League Cup trophy, after a 2021-22 season in which the club finished sixth with no trophies—it's been downhill since. Instead of building on that return to decency, last season United finished eighth in the league and last in its Champions League group, looking dire for most of the campaign.
The Dutch manager was almost immediately on the hot seat last season, losing four out of seven matches in the first six weeks, and it didn't get much better as the season went on. A 4-0 loss to Crystal Palace in early May seemed to signal the end of his time at Old Trafford, but a shock FA Cup final victory over Manchester City bought him enough of a reprieve to try again this season. A spendy summer followed that victory, and if not a return to title contention, the United faithful and brass probably expected a solid push for the top four. If the first six weeks of this season are to be believed, however, they're in for more of the same, which has to have put Ten Hag on the brink of the unemployment line.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The year is 1979. The Phillies are playing the Reds. Pete Rose tries to steal second, and the throw arrives late. The ump signals safe, and instead of arguing the call Cincinnati second baseman Joe Morgan just says: “It’s Pete Rose of the Philadelphia Phillies!” Never mind that Morgan and Rose were teammates for six years on the Reds. Never mind that Rose would’ve been announced earlier as part of the starting lineup, or that he would’ve made it to first base in some way before taking second. It's a commercial, so you have to cut it some slack.
Still, it stands to reason that Joe Morgan would not be particularly shocked to see Rose at second. But he also wasn’t paying all that close attention if he only noticed Rose when the two were right next to each other. The scenario raises a lot of questions, but not necessarily the one that Morgan asks: “And what kind of aftershave you using?”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And with that, episodes 7 and 8 bring Industry's roller-coaster third season to a close. These past 8 weeks may have flown by, but it also feels like we've just finished running a marathon and are in desperate need of an IV drip of fluids straight into the bloodstream. Season 3 of Industry was exhausting, operatic, and stuffed to the gills with action, plot, degradation, sex, and violence. And if the comments on these recaps are any indicator, it has also been a divisive season, with people torn on its pacing, its ratcheted-up storylines episode to episode, and its sensory overload, which undermined the impact of its most catastrophic and exhilarating moments. Season 3 was not interested in patience, letting things breathe, or drawing things out. That worked both to and against the show's …]]></summary>

If Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen’s brand, The Row, has permeated the imaginations of ordinary people who can’t afford $1,000 sandals, it may be because it’s become synonymous with the abysmal internet brainrot trend “quiet luxury,” a backlash to the labelmania that defined much of 2010s fashion, and perhaps an encapsulation of increasing class consciousness in the years coming out of the pandemic.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If Borussia Dortmund is famous for something, it is for being the most consistent, and so far the most successful, challenger to Bayern Munich's Bundesliga supremacy in the 21st century. If Borussia Dortmund is famous for something else, it is for being Europe's premier finishing school for young talents destined for bigger and better salaries and transfer fees upon graduation. Here's a short list of players who have passed through Dortmund in the last 15 years or so, in no particular order: Robert Lewandowski, Ousmane Dembélé, Jadon Sancho, Ilkay Gündogan, Mario Götze, Christian Pulisic, Jude Bellingham, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Erling Haaland, Mats Hummels ... Ok, maybe the list isn't so short, and not all of those players starred upon leaving Dortmund. However, the impressive history of talent detection and refinement is there, and that list is about to get a little bit longer, now that Karim Adeyemi appears to be hitting a new level of excellence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My first pets were a pair of hamsters, sisters from the same litter. I was surprised that such tiny little brains could hold such distinct personalities: Harley, golden and white, was more athletic, more aloof, notably smarter, happy to play by herself; Yankee, a chubby cream-colored meatball, craved human touch—she'd run to the door at the top of her cage and stare up, unable to see much with a hamster's terrible eyesight but secure in the knowledge that I'd soon come to scoop her up. All she wanted was to be held and petted. She was the biggest little sweetie on god's green Earth. The sisters got along grandly in their shared, three-tiered cage. And then one day out of nowhere, and for reasons I never understood and I suspect they didn't either, Yankee starting beating the shit out of Harley every time they'd cross paths—biting her, scratching her, screaming with fury at the mere sight of her previously beloved sister. We separated them, giving each their own cage, and they each lived out their long happy hamster lives in solitary. But it was a good lesson for young me. No matter how fuzzy or friend-shaped, creatures are not simply furry people and can't be viewed or treated as such. Animals are animals.
Grizzly bears, despite looking an awful lot like thousand-pound hamsters, are ur-predators. They are secretive, unknowable, capable of tremendous acts of strength and violence. Our ancestors knew this: The word "bear" was originally a euphemism, invented by our Germanic-speaking predecessors afraid to use the animal's true name, made taboo out of a superstitious fear that speaking it would cause them to meet one. Our Enlightenment-era men of science were no less intimidated—it was designated Ursus arctos horribilis for a reason. This week in Alaska, nature provided a morbid and useful reminder that bears are bears, with all that entails.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Atlanta Braves will play their second elimination game in three days Wednesday afternoon, when Max Fried leads them against Joe Musgrove of the San Diego Padres in Game 2 of their National League Wild Card series. With all due respect to Atlanta's handful of healthy players, the Braves are not wanted here! Four of their, what, six best players are out; the team only nosed into the Wild Card at all because of a preposterous first-in-history gap-day doubleheader, where everyone knew going in that both teams could advance with a split. It's hard to imagine a less legitimate playoff berth than one earned in the second of these two games, after your opponent has already lost all motivation.
It's clear that God has seen enough of the Braves. Three road teams won on Tuesday, including the even more road weary New York Mets, who haven't played a game at home since Sept. 22 and who failed America by going hangover mode in Monday's late game and allowing Atlanta to shamble onwards. The Braves, meanwhile, advanced one single runner to third base in nine innings Tuesday night, struck out 15 times, and were ruthlessly blanked by playoff debutante Michael King and a pair of Padres relievers. For lack of anything even vaguely resembling a suitable alternative, Atlanta manager Brian Snitker handed the ball to A.J. Smith-Shawver, a 21-year-old prospect with fewer than 30 total innings of work in the majors, who threw 87 pitches for the big club this year, all of them back on May 23. Smith-Shawver watched his team squander a first-inning scoring opportunity, then took the mound in a Braves uniform for just the second time in 2024. Seven pitches later, this happened:]]></summary>

Left to their own devices, the locusts are solitary and greenish, mostly indistinguishable from any other grasshopper. When the environment is right and the insects' populations begin to grow, however, the locusts can sense their growing numbers and undergo a dramatic transformation into their gregarious phase. They change their color, their body size, and even their brain. And then the locusts begin to swarm, flying in groups of tens of billions that can reach up to 100 square miles, all in search of food.
Although Schistocerca gregaria is one of the world's most devastating pests, "the desert locust has been little studied in the field, and much of its ecology is still unknown," said Koutaro Ould Maeno, a locust expert at the Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Science.]]></summary>

Though they got off to a strong start of winning a game and then losing a game, or vice versa, they performed too well during the rest of the season to achieve what I would consider historic mediocrity: the highest percentage of games that ended in a .500 record. Their superior competition ended up being their divisional rival.
The last time we checked in with the Red Sox in the race to .500, in the middle of June, the live standings had them at second all-time behind this year's San Diego Padres. While the Padres' second-half surge completely shed any accusations of mediocrity en route to the playoffs—23 out of their 26 games finished at .500 happened within the first 72 games of the season—the Red Sox gave their fans just a little more hope with an 81-81 finish.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After Pete Rose's death was announced on Monday night, a lot of clever microphone addicts opened their obligatory thumbnail summaries of him by explaining that he was "a complicated figure." It’s the sort of thing people say about people when they can’t believe that the person they're describing is really just what they appear to be. Nothing could have been more obviously wrong, in this case, including the concept of hitting on 17. The last thing in the world Pete Rose ever was, for all the things he was or purported to be, was complicated.
He wasn't complicated as a player, a manager, or in the end, as a self-parodic martyr. Rose had smaller measures of the skills that great ballplayers have but a greater capacity to employ them tirelessly, which is what his admirers always admired. He had one overarching gift, though, that covered by the play and the player—the determination and ability, through sheer persistence, to make you make a stand about him. His was the purest kind of narcissism, one so utterly naked that it never needed a second level. He knew that you were only interested in hearing him speak on the subject of him, and that became increasingly true as he grew from boyhood to late boyhood to middle-aged boyhood to octogenarian boyhood.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For too long, as they suffered under a purple-and-gold yoke, Los Angeles Clippers fans were familiar with a very particular sort of pain: The arena stopped serving alcohol at the end of the third quarter, meaning anyone seeking a premium-style VIP luxury bar experience in the dreary confines of an NBA arena during the fourth quarter was out of luck. The thrill of watching James Harden take his 13th and 14th free throws of the night as the Clips try to overcome a late 11-point deficit just doesn't hit the same without a $22 domestic draft. The experience of recounting said free throws five hours later over a $31 gin and tonic is equally paltry if you can't share it with fellow VIPs in the arena where Harden shot those free throws.
Thankfully, California governor Gavin Newsom has solved this pressing problem. On Sunday, Newsom signed AB-3206, an extremely specific bill that will allow alcohol sales to continue until 4:00 a.m. in VIP areas of the new Clippers arena in Inglewood until Jan. 1, 2030. California state law otherwise prohibits alcohol sales between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m.; now, thanks to the state legislature, an arena that has yet to host its first NBA game can boast of the first exception. The bill does not name the Clippers arena specifically, though its carve-out in state liquor law applies strictly to vendors operating in a "fully enclosed arena with a seating capacity of at least 18,000 seats located in the City of Inglewood," and only within a "private area in the arena no larger than 2,500 square feet" after events.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The most honest Francis Ford Coppola has ever been on celluloid isn't present in any of his own movies. Rather, it can be found in a 1991 documentary shot by his wife, Eleanor. Hearts of Darkness, a project started by Eleanor and later finished by co-directors George Hickenlooper and Fax Bahr, tells the story of Francis’s travails while making Apocalypse Now, a movie that was already considered a canonical classic of the New Hollywood era by the time the documentary was released. But at the time of filming, the infamously beleaguered production of Apocalypse Now was just another example of FFC’s limitless, egomaniacal ambition to achieve the ultimate spectacle-as-political-statement, that would speak to something profound about Vietnam, about America, about mankind.
Coppola at that point in time was one of the biggest directors in the world, coming off his two enormously successful Godfather movies and the critically beloved The Conversation. He had long planned to adapt Joseph Conrad's 1899 novel Heart of Darkness, turning it into a story of the Vietnam War that journeyed into the dark night of the human soul. Eleanor’s documentary is about the dark night of Francis’s soul. At times, he is the picture of the overindulged, male auteur full of grandeur and vanity, holding court on the importance of cinema and art and ambition and himself. At other times, he is a ball of exposed nerves, full of anxiety about the difficulty of the production, about the personal wealth he has poured into the film when outside funding ran out, and, worst of all, about the prospect of failing to make a good movie. At one point, he talks about the sin of pretentiousness, about how every artist is terrified of being seen as pretentious, so much so that they pull back or play safe in detrimental ways. He tells his wife that he cannot allow himself to be afraid to be seen as pretentious, as it’s the only way to really go for it. It is a risk worth taking.]]></summary>

Mr. McMahon is named for the character that the real-life McMahon portrayed on TV starting in the late '90s, and the documentary tries to untangle the fiction of that character from the reality of the man—a reality that is oftentimes more repugnant than any wrestling angle could dare to be. It succeeds, to an extent, thanks to the shocking behavior of its subject, but there is a lack of understanding that what made Vince McMahon successful at all costs is also what made him reprehensible.

And then there are the New York Jets. Taking a soggy field for their contest against the Broncos after a solid 2-1 start, head coach Robert Saleh's boys delivered the kind of performance that makes fans in the stands swear off football for life and turns a star quarterback into a sour prig—well, OK, Aaron Rodgers was already that, but he's aiming it more pointedly at his own guys now.
Everyone can agree on this: It was not the defense's fault. After holding the Patriots to three points last week, they shut down the pass and only really slipped up on one Denver touchdown drive. Even late in the game, when they could have pleaded exhaustion, they stiffed the Broncos on key plays and put their offense in position to win. They also helped produce this bleak QB stat graphic:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As always, we're ending the month with a challenging themeless. This week's puzzle was constructed by Greg Snitkin and Glenn Davis, and edited by Hoang-Kim Vu. Greg is a dad with three small kids and a hedge fund accountant from South Orange, N.J. He famously refers to changing diapers as “batting clean-up” (after his kids have “loaded the bases”). His puzzles have appeared in The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Universal. He’s thrilled to see his lifelong friend Glenn make his puzzling debut! Glenn is a reformed sports blogger now working in the nonprofit sector. He hopes this collaboration with Greg is better received than the biology lab report in high school their teacher took them to task for writing too informally.
Defector crosswords, launched in partnership with our friends at AVCX, run every Monday. If you’re interested in submitting a puzzle to us, you can read our guidelines HERE.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It could be worse, White Sox fans. You could be Pirates fans, trapped in a cycle of losing by the caprices of your cheapskate organization, which by releasing one fan-favorite player four plate appearances shy of a contract bonus and benching another, did its part to warn off future free agents. You could be Angels fans, who ever so briefly were allowed to believe they would be free of Arte Moreno's reverse Midas touch, and instead just witnessed the team's losingest season in franchise history, has no future prospects, and spent last week making your White Sox look like world-beaters. You could be A's fans, who on Sunday received one last kick in the crotch after 20 years of it, when the final postgame show of Oakland's season and existence was, for unclear reasons, recorded before game 162 was actually played. "We don’t even know the result of today’s baseball game," studio host Brodie Brazil told viewers trying to prolong the last hours of the Oakland Era—a fitting and final fuck-you to a fanbase that's used to them.
Cheer up, White Sox fans! You ended your season with a win on Sunday, something 11 of the 12 playoff teams won't be able to say. It was your fifth win in six games to close the season and avoid passing the '62 Mets for the worst record in the modern era. Sure, OK, maybe a lot of you were hoping for a loss—hoping that each of your 121 losses could at least be in service of history. That might at least have made the losses teleological and thus more bearable, but they must instead stand on their own as the droppings of an epically but not quite historically bad team. Shit for shit's sake.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The collective agreement on what to do after catching a historic baseball is very fiscally responsible, like a financial literacy course titled "So You Just Won The Lottery." The man who caught Shohei Ohtani's 50/50 home run ball would receive full marks: He declined an initial offer—reportedly $300,000—from the Dodgers and contacted an auction house, Goldin, the next day. Seeing as the current highest bid for the ball sits at $1.2 million with over 16 days to go, it was pragmatic and well-executed, if unsentimental, decision-making. As the seller wished to remain anonymous, the ESPN article on the auction instead quotes Goldin CEO and founder, Ken Goldin, and Goldin seizes upon the opportunity to mete out some uncensored self-advertising: "This is one of those cases where our reputation for getting the absolute highest price on hot-market items [came] into play ... honestly, we had no competition at all."
This is not moral judgment on the man who caught Ohtani's baseball. Imagine being so composed if a house were to fall into your lap; chance would be a fine thing. Ultimately the point of any item of sports memorabilia is to own it or sell it, and to own a baseball of Ohtani's worth is synonymous with being extremely wealthy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At one point in time, Rory Dames was mostly known as a longtime women's soccer coach, leading the NWSL's Chicago Red Stars for about a decade as well as overseeing Chicago-area youth powerhouse Eclipse. But more recently, he's become known as a coach whom players repeatedly reported for emotional abuse and manipulation. Those reports by players did not immediately diminish Dames's power; he only resigned when those accounts began becoming public. The ensuing 234-page Yates report into systemic abuse across women's soccer included his name hundreds of times. 
U.S. Soccer, which oversees the U.S. Women's National Team as well as sanctioning the NWSL, suspended Dames's coaching license and, per USA Today, the federation reported him to the U.S. Center for SafeSport, the organization created by Congress to investigate sexual abuse across Olympic sports. SafeSport doesn't have any jurisdiction over the NWSL, but Dames's presence in the database still mattered, especially given his continued prominence in Chicago-area youth soccer. (The NWSL also banned Dames for life.) SafeSport opened an investigation into Dames, and anyone who searched its database would have found his name.]]></summary>
