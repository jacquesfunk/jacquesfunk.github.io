        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gus Mueller:
This is a major update of Acorn, and is currently on a
time-limited sale for $19.99. It’s still a one time
purchase to use as long as you’d like, and as usual, the full
release notes are available. I want to highlight some of my
favorite things below.
“Select Subject”, “Mask Subject”, and “Remove Background” are new
commands which use machine learning (or A.I. if you prefer) to
find the most important parts of your image, and then perform
their respective operations. This has been a request for a long
time, and while I was doubtful of it’s utility, it’s actually
pretty fun to play with and more useful than I figured it would
be. So I’m glad I took the time to integrate it.
You can now set your measurement units to inches, centimeter, or
pixels, and it shows up across the tools for your image, not just
specific ones. This includes the crop palette, shape dimensions,
filter settings… well, pretty much everything. This might be the
oldest feature request I’ve implemented so far. And then related
to this, Acorn 8 now has an on canvas ruler which you can use to
measure out distances, straighten your image with, or even
redefine the DPI.
Look up Table (LUT) support. LUTs are pretty fun, and they work by
mapping one set of colors to another, enabling consistent or
stylized visual effects. LUTs are used primarily in photography or
filmmaking, and you can download and install new LUTs from various
places across the internet.
And more, so much more. The release notes are copious, and for me, always interesting. Acorn remains one of my most-used tools. It’s fast, reliable, powerful, extensible/scriptable, and the interface makes so much intuitive sense. That’s all been true since version 1.0 back in 2007, and that’s why it’s been my go-to image editor since it was in early beta before version 1.0 back in 2007. It’s just faster and more powerful today.
Acorn is, simply put, one of the best Mac apps ever made. It’s that good. You’re nuts (sorry) if you don’t check it out while it’s available for just $20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made this app for myself, but it's probably worth sharing.
When I tried to find a nice app that I could use to check air quality multiple times a day, I was shocked. All of them looked boring with traffic-light coding and overcrowded with unnecessary data. On top of that, they either contained ads or required payment.
I didn't want to use any of those apps every day, so I thought, "Well, how hard could it be?" and accepted the challenge. I expected to finish development in a month, but since I'm a designer and don't normally program apps, I had to learn Swift on the go. This required a month more than I expected.
In my designs, I'm usually way too focused on efficiency. Since this was my personal project, I wanted to experiment, so I didn't use standard controls or color coding.
Inspired by avant-garde style, I used forms and movement to convey air quality, as well as an asymmetrical layout and overflowing visualizations. I enjoy using the app, and I hope you will, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even before kickoff, the final of the NCAA men's soccer championship was special as a meeting between two underdogs. Marshall, which won its first title in the 2020 season as an unseeded team, was the 13th seed this year and reached the final by defeating the No. 1 Ohio State. Meanwhile, unseeded Vermont beat two-seed Pitt and three-seed Denver on its way to the title game. The Thundering Herd and Catamounts put together a real thriller Monday night, as Vermont won its first championship in program history on a sudden-death goal in overtime.
That goal is at the 7:56 mark of the highlight reel below, though the entire second half of the match was very dramatic. Marshall took a 1-0 lead in the 57th minute after Vermont keeper Niklas Herceg mishandled a tough cross right into the path of Tarik Pannholzer. Herceg kept his team in it with a beautiful save minutes later, and in the 81st minute, Marcell Papp took advantage of a poor clearance from Marshall keeper Aleksa Janjic to start and finish a one-two with a shot from just inside the box. You're here for the winner, though. In overtime, centerback Zach Barrett intercepted a pass in the Vermont half and smacked a speculative longball for Maximilian Kissel. The forward shrugged off his defender, then dribbled around Janjic and scored.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since 2018, Christmas—or rather, XXXmas—has made a provocative, year-round statement in an Oslo traffic circle. At its center stands a 20-foot-tall (6-meter) figure, simply called Santa—a creation that has become both a curiosity and a controversy.

The striking red bronze sculpture, created by Los Angeles artist Paul McCarthy, has earned nicknames like the “Dildo Gnome” and “Santa with Butt Plug” because the object Santa holds—a Christmas tree—bears a suggestive resemblance to a sex toy. With exaggerated features and provocative humor, it’s impossible to miss.

McCarthy frames his work as a critique of Western consumerism and the holiday season’s excesses, blending high and low culture with playful irreverence. He notes that an innocent Christmas icon can carry distinctly adult undertones: while it might simply be a Christmas tree, it could also resemble a butt plug—redefining it as abstract art.

Public opinion in Oslo is divided: some see the statue as a tacky distraction, while others embrace its absurdity as a quirky addition to the cityscape. Even far-right organizations have voiced their disapproval, arguing that it undermines traditional values, sparking debates about artistic expression and cultural identity.

Christian Ringnes, brewer heir and philanthropist, whose foundation funded the project, calls the statue a bold centerpiece for the area—an amusing, lively twist for an otherwise unremarkable spot. Ringnes admits he initially saw it as a jolly Santa Claus, only later recognizing its more provocative interpretations.

Oslo’s version, painted bright red and constructed from rough, horizontal slices, differs from the smooth, dark, unpainted original in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Planned for installation in 2001, the Dutch statue faced delays and was ultimately relocated a couple of times after intense backlash to its design.]]></summary>

A west-flowing river sounds like it should have been a highway for the westbound emigrants, and to some degree it was. It was not an artery like the great rivers of the east, however. It is blocked by waterfalls in its upper reaches (of which the lowermost is Shoshone Falls). Even below the falls, it runs through deep canyons, often punctuated by rapids. Exasperated trappers, in the words of trapper Wilson Price Hunt, called it the Mad River in the early 19th century.

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42444667</id>
        <link href="https://pypi.org/project/najaeda/"/>
        <updated>2024-12-17T19:56:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to introduce Naja EDA, a Python package designed to streamline post-synthesis Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows.
Naja EDA offers a robust framework that enables both software and hardware developers to efficiently navigate and manipulate electronic designs.
Key Features:
- Comprehensive Netlist Exploration:
  . Navigate netlist hierarchies with ease.

  . Access multiple levels of detail, including bit-level and bus-level granularity.

  . Explore instance-by-instance or utilize flattened views at the primitives level.

  . View per-instance connections or comprehensive equipotential networks.

  . Apply and manage design changes seamlessly.

  . Experiment with new EDA concepts using an intuitive API.

  . Build tailored tools to address specific challenges without relying on proprietary EDA software.

Simple example - print all instances in the design:
    def print_netlist(instance):
        for child_instance in instance.get_child_instances():
            print(f"{child_instance}:{child_instance.get_model_name()}")
            print_netlist(child_instance)

- https://pypi.org/project/najaeda/
- https://github.com/najaeda/naja
We would love to hear your feedback and learn more about how we can make naja EDA useful for software and hardware designers !
Looking forward to your thoughts!

From casual kickbacks to formal family dinners, here’s a playlist sure to please any crowd
 December belongs to the at-home entertainers. Early winter holidays and cooler weather offer myriad reasons to host events at home, from casual Christmas cookie swaps to intimate, cozy dinner parties. And one of the most fun, albeit daunting, tasks associated with hosting an event at home is organizing a playlist that sets the proper mood — especially when the genre is as polarizing as holiday music.
People have volatile reactions to holiday music; tearing up to a hymn at midnight mass, singing along to a classic, and excited gasps when a childhood tune unlocks a core memory. For everyone who thinks “Last Christmas” is a straight-u…]]></summary>

Cookbook clubs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emma Chamberlain's most recent YouTube video opens with a montage of archival clips of her trying on outfits, shopping, and then purging her clothes over the years. Despite having, in her estimation, thousands of articles of clothing, Chamberlain says she was never satisfied. Instead, once she had accumulated what she decided were too many clothes, she would do a massive purge of her closet—only to fill it back up again. It's an interminable cycle: Buying a new thing is the answer to your emotional issue du jour, that is until you've unintentionally filled your home with too many things, at which point the only thing you can do to feel better is to purge. 
Once Chamberlain had ruthlessly evaluated each of the pieces in her closet, what she was left with, to her surprise, was a sort of capsule wardrobe, a deliberately small, curated collection of clothing intended to be worn interchangeably. That Chamberlain, uber-influencer and proprietor of a 12 million–follower YouTube channel, has gone capsule is indicative of the sustaining appeal of the concept, and I believe indicates an attempt to exert aesthetic control in a time of marked economic and social instability.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I built a CLI tool designed to streamline job hunting for software engineers. You can manage your job search more effectively by populating your professional connections and tracking companies of interest. Once set up, you can deploy it to a server to continuously scrape new job postings and share them directly to a Discord channel via free webhooks. This makes it easy to stay updated on relevant opportunities in real-time.
Why I made this?:
LinkedIn sucks, their email blasts are often spammy and filled with irrelevant listings. On top of that, if you’re relying solely on mainstream platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed, it’s nearly impossible to be first in line for a newly posted opportunity. It scrapes company job boards directly, ensuring you’re notified of opportunities the moment they go public.
Still making improvements everyday but you can give it a try using Homebrew (macOs) or install via Cargo (windows, linux). Appreciate any feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blackmagic Design:
Blackmagic Design announced it will start taking pre-orders for
the new Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive camera — the world’s first
commercial camera system designed to capture Apple Immersive Video
for Apple Vision Pro — today with deliveries due to start in
early 2025. DaVinci Resolve Studio will be updated to support
editing Apple Immersive Video early next year, offering
professional filmmakers a comprehensive workflow for producing
Apple Immersive Video for Apple Vision Pro. Apple Immersive Video
is a remarkable 180-degree media format that leverages
ultra-high-resolution immersive video and Spatial Audio to place
viewers in the center of the action. [...]
Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive features a fixed, custom lens
system pre-installed on the body, which is designed specifically
to capture Apple Immersive Video for Apple Vision Pro. The sensor
delivers 8160 × 7200 resolution per eye with pixel level
synchronization and an incredible 16 stops of dynamic range, so
cinematographers can shoot 90fps 3D immersive cinema content to a
single file. The custom lens system is designed for URSA Cine’s
large format image sensor with extremely accurate positional data
that’s read and stored at time of manufacturing. This immersive
lens projection data — which is calibrated and stored on device — then travels through post production in the Blackmagic RAW
file itself.
$30,000 — not cheap, but not crazy. And this isn’t merely 3D in a rectangular frame — it’s 180° 8K 3D.
David Smith:
What really intrigues me about it is when/if it will show up for
rental. I have a few tentative ideas in this space I’d love to
explore but I don’t think would justify the cost of owning one.
Looks like Lensrentals rents a vaguely similar, traditional
Blackmagic camera kit for around $1,000/week ... which would make
experimentation much more accessible.

Running a family takes coordination to figure out who is doing what and when.  WindChime is an app built to make that a little easier.
It automatically sends notifications when you make a task request, and you'll get a notification when the task is complete so you don't have to follow-up to find out if something is done.
Current contact and todo apps create information silos necessitating messaging contacts and task requests back and forth. WindChime reduces the friction of coordination by making the information available across everyone's phones (parents, childcare, kids).
Built by two dads who want great apps for their family life.

These are the food phenomena we’d like to bid adieu to in the coming year
 While 2024 saw many great things in the world of food and drinks — excellent new restaurants! An actually good season of Great British Bake Off! — there is much that the Eater staff would like to say goodbye to as we move into 2025. Some of these food and dining phenomena, from the benign annoyances to the potentially harmful, are perhaps more than mere trends. But, by naming them here we’re throwing our naive hope out into the universe that in the months to come they will please finally stop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started this project because I believe MCP has the potential to transform how AI models interact with external resources, but the ecosystem is still very fragmented. There's no central place to discover and compare all the server implementations available, which makes adoption and experimentation harder for developers.
I initially built the GitHub repo awesome-mcp-servers (https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers/), and it's been amazing to see the community contribute to it. Now, I'm taking it further with a directory that automates many tasks—introspecting servers to determine the tools, resources, and prompts they provide, inferring required configurations, and checking dependencies for vulnerabilities. These features are designed to make it easier for people to trust and use these servers in production environments.
While an open-source protocol is fantastic for innovation, I also think we need a centralized channel for addressing critical issues like security vulnerabilities, dependency management, and user support. My hope is that this directory not only grows with help from contributions, but also becomes a trusted resource for anyone entering the MCP space. If you're working on MCP servers or are interested in the project, I'd love to hear your thoughts!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN!
In a recent "Ask HN: What are you working on?" thread, I mentioned I was working on OCRing a large book:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41971614
The post generated some interest so I thought I would keep HN posted.
The book is Saint-Simon’s Memoirs -- an invaluable historical account of the French court under Louis XIV, full of wit, sharp observations, and of incredible literary value. I'm OCRing the edition of reference made between 1879-1930, that contains a lot of comments and footnotes: 45 volumes, ~27,000 pages.
Here's a link to a blog post that describes the techniques used so far (the project is still ongoing):
https://blog.medusis.com/38_Adventures+in+OCR.html
But you may also directly access the result here:
https://divers.medusis.net/boislisle/pub
This web app (not optimized for mobile, sorry) solves a tricky problem of preloading images efficiently. In short: preloading the next image isn't enough, since browsers will repaint if an image is moved, or scaled. Or browsers won't paint at all if visibility is hidden or opacity is zero, and will paint only when those values change. On an average, slow machine, this takes visible time. But if an image is simply behind another element, it will be painted, and the removal of the covering element or changing the z-index will not trigger a repaint.
(Preloading is important because it lets one review results fast; if one has to wait 150-200 ms between images it's simply discouraging).
Would love to hear feedback; happy to answer any question!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We built a way to go from requirements to a fully working admin panel/internal tool -type application within minutes. As a user you provide the various entities and their relationship plus any reports or dashboard widgets and it will generate it for you.
The problem with existing no code tools is that you still need to spend a lot of time building after figuring out what is needed (a problem of its own). Being able to focus on what is needed means you can build faster than designing, dragging, dropping, configuring.
What can you describe? Everything from tables, field types, relationships between tables and columns/fields, role-based access restrictions (RBAC), reports, dashboard metrics, bar/line/pie charts, lists.
This is made possible by fine-tuning Llama 3.1 to convert requirements into specs and code. Applications evolve over time and this means that the model has to be predictable between versions to ensure that the data/schema migrations can be generated cleanly, as well as provide any errors and warnings related to the requirements or data loss.
For non-developers this can be a huge time-saver since you don't have to use any additional developer resources. For developers it can be a great way to get 80+% of the way for complex apps (it's like super-scaffolding). Generated apps can be fully evaluated before purchase. A full git repo containing the back-end, front-end, migrations, etc. is the output of the entire process.
Currently the generated code base is TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next.js but the capability is there to generate different stacks because of the approach taken to not go directly to code when fine-tuning.

We look forward to your thoughts. Does building apps this way make sense for the super savvy HN crowd?

- One tool to ingest data
- Another one to transform it
- If you wanted to run Python, set up an orchestrator
- If you need to check the data,  a data quality tool
Let alone this being hard to set up and taking time, it is also pretty high-maintenance. I had to do a lot of infra work, and while this being billable hours for me I didn’t enjoy the work at all. For some parts of it, there were nice solutions like dbt, but in the end for an end-to-end workflow, it didn’t work. That’s why I decided to build an end-to-end solution that could take care of data ingestion, transformation, and Python stuff. Initially, it was just for our own usage, but in the end, we thought this could be a useful tool for everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So far, the person who killed United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson seems to have gotten what he wanted. It has been 13 days since Thompson was gunned down on a Manhattan street, and at this point the murder has been rather comfortably situated as an act of political violence. Authorities have charged a man named Luigi Mangione with the crime, and if a note he was carrying with him at the time of his arrest is to be believed, Thompson was killed as a response to the cruelty and depravity of the American healthcare industry, which has since become an urgent topic of conversation in American media and culture.
Evidence of the killer’s victory can be found on any news channel, or in any number of mainstream publications. There was a brief period of time when one could get away with dismissing the enthusiasm that swelled around Mangione’s alleged act as something that only existed in the unreality of the internet—the byproduct of a small, irony-poisoned segment of the country that best understands how to use social media as a megaphone. If that enthusiasm ever was contained, it has since escaped: SNL is now a safe place to joke about Thompson’s death, and respectable publications like The New Yorker and New York Magazine have acknowledged Mangione’s folk-hero status. The effectiveness of the killing can also be found in reactions from those in the government. New York Governor Kathy Hochul has convened a “safety summit” for New York CEOs, and Florida authorities charged a mother with making terroristic threats for saying “delay, deny, depose” (the words Mangione allegedly wrote on his shell casings) during a phone call with her insurance provider. Senator Elizabeth Warren evidently takes the groundswell of support for Mangione seriously enough to pander to those who sympathize with him. She recently went on TV to say, “Violence is never the answer … but you can only push people so far.”]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-12-17T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originating over a thousand years ago, the Nebuta Matsuri is a traditional summer festival held in several cities in Aomori Prefecture, most notably in Aomori City. Originally a lantern festival, Nebuta has since developed into a parade involving huge papier-mâché floats that mainly portray kabuki actors, mythological figures, and folk heroes.

Founded in 2011, the Nebuta Museum Wa Rasse exhibits such floats used in the most recent festival, celebrating this unique cultural event and archiving its history. The name was chosen as the winner of a public naming competition; rasse is based on rasse-ra, the typical heave-ho shout cried out by the float-haulers, while wa has several meanings in Japanese including "harmony" and "circle." Together, the name is also meant to evoke the word warai, or "laughter."

Located in the Aomori Waterfront area, the museum is only a short walk from the city’s central station. The building that houses the museum is an eye-catching sight, with red vertical louvers covering its exterior and giving its entrance a look like that of a steel curtain parting to welcome visitors.

The museum is a dark, spacious hall filled with colorful lights coming from the Nebuta floats, showcasing traditional artistry and folklore. The papier-mâché figures are astonishingly dynamic, with flowing hair and splashing water magically brought to life.]]></summary>

It also includes a bunch of flags to get exactly what you want in the format you want.
I got this idea as I was trying organize the large amount of local git repos I had. I also found it particularly useful when traveling since I use a different device. In these cases, it is really helpful to know which local git repos I forgot to push commits or have fallen behind the remote version.
Hope you find it really useful, let me know if you like it and also if you have any feedback for it!

Many sellers like me rely on DMs or clunky solutions, which can make managing sales and payments a headache. I wanted to simplify the process by turning my Instagram into a fully functioning storefront, quickly and effortlessly.
What CheckoutLink does: 
 Turn Instagram posts into shoppable links—sell directly through DMs or bio links. 
 Manage products, buyers, sales and payments from one simple dashboard.
 Sync your PayPal or Stripe account to get paid instantly. 
 Quick setup with no coding or website required.
I'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback or any suggestions you have to make CheckoutLink even better. Feel free to ask me anything!
Thank you so much for your support and I hope CheckoutLink can help you grow your business as well!

But that's not to say there isn't space for humour, when the events of the past have so often been surreal, ironic, or downright disastrous. Toby Clements, whose new novel A Good Deliverance takes the form of a 15th-century prison confession, recommends five of the funniest historical novels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN! Agora is a search engine for e-commerce products. We've indexed 4 million products sold on 8,100 Shopify and WooCommerce stores and made them easy to purchase with a single cart transaction. Think of a decentralized Amazon.
I originally launched Agora as a side project here on HN to find a pair of red shoes for my wife last Christmas. I quickly realized that some of the best products on the internet are sold by small online stores that struggle to get the same visibility as large retailers. I started Agora on a mission to solve this problem. If you sell the best pair of red shoes in the world, customers should be able to find it.
We recently built a merchant dashboard that helps Shopify and WooCommerce merchants sell more on our search engine. Agora Merchants connects to your existing e-commerce store without any painful setup required and helps you track your store's performance on Agora. We don't take a commission of sales, orders are routed to your existing point of sale system, and inventory is automatically uploaded and refreshed. We do this with a combination of crawlers and AI agents.
So how is this different than Amazon? Both Amazon and Agora give network effects to stores (i.e. if you're searching for red shoes from one store, you may also want to buy a red dress sold by a different store). The key difference with Agora is that you continue selling on your existing e-commerce store, without having to manage inventory and payouts on another platform. This creates a magical experience for our merchants that saves them hundreds of hours. We believe in a future where merchants can sell however they want, we just bring them more customers.
I'd love your feedback!

Baking my wedding cake helped me save money — and be really present as a bride
 Everything about my wedding fell into place, which was the only way I could have ever considered having one. We chose the venue because a friend was its beverage director and offered his help in setting it up. The day we got the wedding license, we met another friend for dinner and he let us know that he had officiated a friend’s wedding, so we asked if he’d oversee ours. I sent a photographer whose work I love an Instagram DM asking for her suggestions for someone who might want the gig, and to my great surprise, she offered to do it herself for a wildly under-market rate. The guest list was kept to 30 people because we only wanted our close family and dearest friends in attendance (…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At every event, tons of photos are taken, but they rarely get used well. As organizers, you post a handful on social media while the best moments are scattered across attendee phones. And if you’re hoping for engagement or visibility? It’s a grind.
We built Premagic, an event tool that flips this problem.
Here’s what we do:
Instant Photo Sharing: We use AI to auto-select the best event photos and share them in real time with attendees. They get photos they love. You get organic visibility when they share (and they do).
Branded Advocacy Posters: Personalized “I’m attending” or “I’m speaking” posters are generated automatically—no designer needed. Attendees become your event’s marketing army.
AI Avatar Check-Ins: We turn event check-ins into an experience. Attendees can generate personalized, branded avatars on the spot—fun, shareable, and sponsor-friendly.
We’ve tested this at over 2,000 events and seen a 3x increase in organic social reach for organizers. Event marketers and sponsors love it because it amplifies visibility without paid ads.
We’re event tech folks trying to make photos and moments work harder—organically.
Would love your feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers appear to have refreshed their mojo. It was never far gone, although consecutive home-and-away losses to the Atlanta Hawks confer a soupçon of illegitimacy so long as the Hawks remain the only team in the NBA to have lost twice to the abominable three-win Washington Wizards. The Cavaliers appear to have recovered from the wobble, and this is all normal basketball business in November and December, but it's enough to say that the team regressed after the best start in franchise history. That was inevitable. The questions had to do with how far their form would dip—are they as capable of excruciating lows as they are of rarified highs—and where precisely they'd sit in the league hierarchy once they'd settled.
That is possibly the most hedged and evasive basketblog lede ever written about a team with just four losses a third of the way through an NBA regular season. Part of that, I swear, is an effort to contain my own excitement about this Cavaliers team. I find them very easy to like, notwithstanding the few minutes every game that Donovan Mitchell spends waving his personal stamp around like a crazed mail clerk. Monday night they beat the absolute hell out of the Brooklyn Nets, recovering from a quick opening deficit with a vicious 16–0 run and then pouring it on, so that the final 39 minutes or so of a 48-minute contest were treated like an exhibition. Cleveland's scoring efficiency was downright unreasonable: The four starters not named Donovan Mitchell combined for 56 points and missed just five total shots and one free throw between them. Caris LeVert and Georges Niang drilled 8 of 14 three-point attempts off the bench. Without anyone even having a standout performance, the Cavs breezed to 130 points, and only Darius Garland kicking the ball around uncharacteristically and Sam Merrill forgetting how to shoot prevented them from sniffing 150.]]></summary>

This project validates cryptographic proofs and demonstrates how succinct, verifiable computations can be achieved.
Using Rust's powerful libraries like arkworks, I implemented pairing checks, public input commitments, and proof validation logic while ensuring the code remains modular and efficient.
I handled the complexities of affine group operations, scalar multiplications, and optimized public input verification to make this a practical ZK verifier.
Let me know what you think! Happy to answer questions about the design, challenges, or ZK cryptography in general.

between conservative color-blindness and liberal race-consciousness that had dominated

advance white Christian nationalism. Liberals no longer settle for

For most of my life, I only knew matzo as one thing: a dry, somewhat flavorless cracker that always came in the same orange-and-white cardboard box. We ate it during holidays, but never really enjoyed it, and certainly it never occurred to me to eat matzo on purpose beyond the 10 days or so a year when it was mandated. But is it any surprise that matzo became yassified? The latest company to tackle the unleavened market is Matzo Project, a cute, bubbe-themed brand that makes matzo good enough for even goyim to snack on: Matzo Project. It makes the usual “flats” and also meal for ball making, but may I suggest unwrapping a bag of matzo chips?  Small, wafer-like crackers that come speckled with everything seasoning, cinnamon sugar, or just salt. They’re tasty and flavorful, but their key characteristic might be their hardiness, which makes them ideal for any thick dip.



No peeking! But check out what the Eater Advent Calendar has already revealed.  And check back each day for a new clutch condiment, gadget, or nibble that, yes, makes an amazing gift — but these surprises are just for you.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most of western Bulgaria is a moderate seismic risk zone, but it is also blessed with many hot springs. They vary in temperature and the healing mineral they naturally contain, and have been enjoyed ever since Roman times.

In Gorna Banya, the water has been revered for its healing nature for centuries. According to local folk tales, the waters had restored the once-abandoned village and healed a hunting dog from the valley of Sofia.

In 1922, a modern bathhouse with separate bathing areas and medical facilities was built, replacing an old Ottoman building. The ornate brick structure was designed in a late Vienna Secession style, with reinforced concrete domes and stone statues.

Public bathing culture started to decline in the 1960s as bathrooms became commonplace in new buildings, and collapsed further after the fall of the communist regime, as government subsidies for public baths dried out, leaving all but a few profitable structures closed and abandoned. The Gorna Banya bath house was no exception.

Today, the beautiful abandoned structure is a shadow of its former self. Yet contrary to most of its abandoned counterparts, it rarely falls completely silent. The water that once gave it life now flows freely right next to it, in a public fountain that attracts those who still seek the town's mineral-rich waters.]]></summary>

How acris.ai works:
1. Each step is an LLM prompt that you can chain together and execute. You can choose the type of a step: Text, JSON, Function Call, ReAct Agent, Vector DB etc.
2. Deploy it as a web application or JSON API
3. All free for now. Will implement usage based charging later
Feedback is welcome.

The tool is pretty simple:
- Drop an image or use example ones (apples, llamas)
- Hit detect
- Get visual bounding boxes + JSON output

The chain is coming for McDonald’s and Chick-fil-A, and the end result doesn’t feel totally Taco Bell
 As anyone who frequents Taco Bell knows, most of its menu is just assemblages of the same few gloops. There is the bean gloop, the cheese gloop (a personal favorite), and of course, the beef gloop. These are the essential, constituent elements of most items on the Taco Bell menu, guaranteeing that if you like the Beefy 5-layer Burrito you’ll probably also like the Mexican Pizza.
The chain’s newest addition, however, is decidedly not gloop. It is chicken nuggets, which hit stores nationwide later this week (for now, on a limited basis). With a thick, craggy coating and breast meat, the end result exists more…]]></summary>

Then, when he built something, I would ask him to redesign it. He would tell me that if I had been clearer from the start, he wouldn’t have had to scrap his previous version. Let me know if this helps you as well ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN,
I built a leaderboard app to track rankings for my Catan group. It’s based on the Elo ranking system—the same system used in chess.
Everyone starts with 1100 points, and your score changes based on game results. Beating a stronger player earns you more points.
Turns out, the "elo" system isn’t just for chess. It works for any competitive game. We’re now using it for a variety of board games, and even for padel, and tennis.
Recently, I decided to open it up to the public.
You can give it a try — it’s free.

This spring, the Justice Department announced a major victory against a drug firm that manufactured billions of opioid painkillers. Endo Health Solutions, the agency said, would face $1.5 billion in fines and forfeitures and plead guilty to a corporate criminal charge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I built FightJetLag.fyi to help travelers reduce jet lag and feel functional faster.
Huge fan of the sleep research and functional performance research and wanted to ensure everyone has the opportunity to understand Jet lag and plan for it!
You enter your travel details (current location, destination, date/time of travel), and it generates a tailored protocol to minimize jet lag. The suggestions are split into:
-Before Travel
-During Travel
-After Travel
The advice is based on sleep, nutrition, light exposure, and other science-backed strategies. You can also choose different levels of aggressiveness: mild, medium, or aggressive approaches depending on how seriously you want to tackle jet lag.
It's designed for anyone: frequent flyers, business travelers, athletes, or casual vacationers.
I’d love feedback on the site, the protocols, or any ideas to improve it. Does this solve a problem you've faced?
Try it out https://www.fightjetlag.fyi/ — and let me know what you think!
Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paul Kafasis, on the Rogue Amoeba blog:
Even as our products steadily grew in popularity, our relationship
with Apple was almost non-existent. Plenty of individuals inside
the company were fans, but we received very little attention from
Apple as a corporate entity. We didn’t much mind being outsiders,
but it meant that we often had zero notice of breaking changes
introduced by Apple.
During this time, Apple placed an emphasis on improving the
security of MacOS, continually locking the operating system down
further and further. Though their changes weren’t aimed at the
legitimate audio capture we provided our users, they nonetheless
made that capture increasingly difficult. We labored to keep our
tools functioning with each new version of MacOS. Through it all,
we lived with a constant fear that Apple would irreparably break
our apps.
In 2020, the disaster foreshadowed literally one sentence ago
struck. Beta versions of MacOS 11 broke ACE, our then-current
audio capture technology, and the damage looked permanent.
Kafasis is a friend and frequent guest on The Talk Show (and holds his own as a podcast co-host with a combustible collaborator), and I use quite a few apps in Rogue Amoeba’s suite, so I was familiar with the broad outline of this saga. But seeing it all spelled out made clear it was a lot more precarious than I thought.

Some FAQs
Q) How Does Savvy’s CLI work?
   Savvy’s CLI uses shell hooks (full support for bash and zsh. Fish support is in beta) to capture commands. Savvy’s CLI never looks at any command outputs or active keystrokes. Users have to explicitly opt-in (by typing savvy record/savvy record history) to capture commands every single time.

   Once you select a particular workflow with savvy run, savvy starts a new sub-shell and walks you through each step of the way. No manual copy paste or editing commands to provide run time values.

   Demo: https://getsavvy.so/demo

   Savvy takes your redacted commands as input and uses Llama 3.x hosted on Groq to create a first draft of your workflow.

   Savvy ask/explain are powered by  GPT 4/GPT4o to convert natural language to shell commands and vice-versa.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is our Atlas of Water Science. It's a globe mapping water science that colleagues have done over the past few years. Approx 300 papers got analyzed. The pipeline sends open access papers to an LLM asks the LLM to extract areas relevant to science in a form suitable for a geocoder, then we use a geocoder to get lat lons. When things happen in the same spot we jitter the locations a bit to differentiate things. gpt4o-mini was used for most of the analysis. Some of the features on the website are directly invented by Claude. There are some errors when geocoding went wrong or locations were extracted incorrectly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm exited to share this project I've been working on with you. Simply, it makes productivity and studying instantly rewarding and engaging from the start, increasing the chance of consistency in the long term.
You can start "training sessions" which are the timers where you are meant to focused. During this, if you are studying you can take AI generated quizzes based on certain subjects. Right now its a dropdown selection of set topics as I'm not sure of the safety of allowing people to type whatever they want to the AI, but I might change that.
After the training sessions, based on the time trained and the team you have built, you receive points. These points can be used to build up your team by opening packs of various rarities. With this, you feel rewarded from getting points and being productive instantly. Along with this, you can join 'leagues' which are rooms with other people to compete to be the best. Also, you can compete in real time matches against others to make your team have more worth than show.
Its publicly released but I'm still improving it daily and all I would like is for people to use it and give feedback, good or bad. Thank you!

When I was in college, I went to a party that I’ll never forget.
 The theme was Alice in Wonderland, and the crowd outside of the house was made up of people dressed as Mad Hatters, Red Queens, and more. 
 But the real spectacle was inside. There was not a piece of furniture to be seen. The walls of all the empty rooms were covered in newspapers, and all the overhead lights had been replaced with black-light bulbs, filling the air with a purple haze. Someone had used the newspapers as a canvas, drawing giant mushrooms and other psychedelic shapes with white paint that glowed blue in the ultraviolet light. 
 Someone in that house had paid attention in chemistry…]]></summary>

Of the 119 works in the series, two depict the same location in today's Ueno Park: a horticultural oddity known as the Moon Pine Tree.

Founded in 1631 and moved to the current location in 1694, the Kiyomizu-Kannondō pavilion of the former Kan'ei-ji Temple complex is modeled after Kiyomizu-dera Temple in Kyoto, with its own version of the famous platform called the "stage." In front of it once stood the Moon Pine Tree, a landscaping wonder with a long branch that drew a perfect circle, from which visitors could have a scenic view of the Shinobazu Pond framed in a full moon.

The original Moon Pine Tree was knocked down in the early Meiji era during a typhoon and remained lost for nearly 150 years. In 2012, it was reconstructed with state-of-the-art horticultural techniques. Though often overlooked, it's worth climbing up to the Kiyomizu stage and take a look through the moon at the quaint, yet modern district of Ueno below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got approached by the finance department of a large company. There is a new regulation in Europe that mandates a defined XML-format for e-invoices for some transactions and - I kid you not - their SAP implementation wasn't able to address this. They also said that all solutions on the market were either cumbersome (think: manually typing in all fields) or required deep system integration.
I thought it cannot be that hard to use AI for this and built a little invoice converter that takes your PDF invoice in whatever form it is, and outputs exactly the XML structure that is required in the regulation. Given that AI is not perfect (but surprisingly close to it!), you can manually edit all fields.
Target users are companies where their current solution does not yet support the standard and that do not want to change their existing invoicing flow (incl. foreign businesses).
Trying it out is free. Given this is my first real B2B tool, would love some feedback!

Check an item, decide if you want it to be automatically relisted in N days or at X date (or never).
That's it: no AI, no notifications, no nothing.
Backstory:
As a product manager, I always wanted to build things but never had time to learn how to code them.
Six months ago, I asked people around if I should invest 20-something weeks into learning React or, in that timespan, LLMs would be capable of doing programming for me. The consensus was that I should learn to code. I disagreed with it.
Two weeks ago, I paid for GitHub Copilot and, with o1-preview's help, devised the plan and developed the actual code of my PWA. It works as a charm, so I, my family, and friends use it every day, precisely as planned.
Now, I can comfortably say that I still don't know how to code, but that won't stop me and shouldn't stop any other non-coder from developing something they want anymore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
Let me introduce Carton …
A product can be defined by the answers to your customers' questions. A feature brings together questions and answers. While the questions mostly remain the same, the answers can change and may correspond to different versions, forming a roadmap for future product success. A phenotype is the visualization of an answer, evolving as the answers change over time.
Carton provides a framework for product scoping (not project management or product design) that makes use of this definition.
Let's think even further. With the advent of artificial intelligence, the entire process of software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Soon, software will be created more through natural conversation than traditional programming languages.
Carton helps ensure you always have a clear record of what you've asked from the AI and, even better, helps to request what comes next.
Its a very early proof of concept phase. Super excited to hearing what you think!

I wanted to show what we have been working on for the last few weeks. We have done data extraction/web scraping for the last few months, and we built this internally to help us. However, clients requested a SAAS tool, so here it is!
You guys can test it out here (app.potarix.com). Everyone who signs up gets 5$ credits. Scraping each page takes up $0.10 of your credits. You are not charged for unsuccessful scrapes!
We launched last week, and our platform was super buggy. We initially launched without the concept of "jobs" in our product, so every time you wanted to scrape a platform, you would have to wait 5 minutes on one screen to get your results. Something is bound to happen in those 5 minutes, so the task would fail for some unknown reason.
Looking ahead, we built stuff in-house that we would love to include in the SAAS platform shortly. We have built functionality to click, type, scroll, etc. on the page. AI also tends to be wrong sometimes, so we created a tweakable script in the backend to control the agent's actions. That way, you are in control and can bring the script to 100% accuracy. We have also seen people battling to build infrastructure for their large-scale scraping projects. We wanna autonomously let folk set up parallelization and choose the infra for their project so everything is scraped as quickly and succinctly as possible from the SAAS.
If any of these future features sound interesting, feel free to book some time, and we can discuss how we can help you with these now!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Located near Kilmartin in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, Poltalloch House is a significant 19th-century mansion now in ruins. Constructed between 1849 and 1853, the house was designed by William Burn, a prominent architect known for his work in the Scottish Baronial style. Built for the Malcolm family, who were influential landowners in the area, the mansion features characteristic elements of the style, including turrets, battlements, and crow-stepped gables.

The house's decline began during World War II when it was requisitioned by the military. The wartime use led to significant wear and tear. After the war, the high costs of maintenance and changing economic circumstances contributed to the mansion's abandonment in the mid-20th century. Over time, Poltalloch House fell into disrepair, with its roof collapsing and interior largely destroyed.

Today, Poltalloch House stands as a ruin. While no full restoration has been undertaken, there have been efforts to stabilize the structure to prevent further deterioration. Despite its dilapidated state, the house remains an important example of William Burn’s architectural work and the Scottish Baronial style that was popular in the Victorian era. It is fascinating to view the way in which nature has taken over the ruins with many trees and vines running over the crumbling structures. The mansion and the surrounding estate are historically significant to the region, reflecting the social and economic history of Scotland’s aristocracy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How far can Manchester City fall? That's the question coming out of the weekend, as the four-time reigning champions suffered the latest indignity in what is now a run of eight losses in 11 games with just a single, solitary win. This latest blow came Sunday at the hands of its crosstown rivals, as Manchester United won the local derby in almost surreal fashion, turning around a first half 1-0 deficit into a two-goals-in-two-minutes late barrage to pick up the 2-1 win at City's shell-shocked stadium. The loss alone is bad enough for City, but the way that it lost, to what looked like a flaccid United side for about 98 percent of the match, will bring even more pain to Pep Guardiola and his beleaguered squad of expensive underachievers.

*Key features:*
- One-click WireGuard server deployment on Vultr/Linode
- Automatic server cleanup when inactive (configurable: 30min/1h/2h/4h or custom)
- Simple web UI for server management
- Downloads WireGuard configs directly
The cleanup feature monitors WireGuard connections - if no peers are connected for your set period, the server is automatically destroyed to save costs. You can adjust this timeout in the UI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few weeks ago, in a post primarily complaining about Google’s disingenuous claims about their Messages app’s support for encryption (they suggest, heavily, that it encrypts every message or most messages, but fact only supports encryption for RCS message sent between users of Google Messages on Android devices), I also complained about the fact that Google’s own Google Voice doesn’t support RCS at all.
Turns out Google Fi doesn’t support RCS fully either. Google Fi is Google’s cellular phone service. I actually use it to provide service to my Android burner phone. The prices are excellent and the service is fine for my minimal needs for a phone I barely use. But Google Fi offers something called “call and voicemail sync” that lets Fi users make and answer voice calls through the web. If you enable this, you lose RCS. See Reddit threads here and here with Fi fans complaining about it.
It’s just wild to me that Google would spend years waging a campaign urging Apple to support RCS, yet Google itself doesn’t support RCS in its own products.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chef Hiroki Odo uses a wagyu blend, sansho peppercorns, sake, and tamari to create this decadent burger.
 “I thought it would be nice to make a hamburger that mixed New York and Japan,” says chef Hiroki Odo. Actually, he made six. At Hall, Odo’s “conceptual bar” in the Flatiron District, the limited menu features a selection of wagyu burgers, from a simple single cheeseburger to one topped with A5 wagyu steak. 
Step by step, general manager Brian Saito walks through crafting Hall’s burgers. He starts with a blend of Sakura Wagyu chuck and A5 wagyu, finely grinding them and controlling just how much fat is in each patty. Then there’s the sauce, a combination of sansho peppercorns, “a perfect complement for the fattiness of the wagyu,” reduced in sake and tamari. It’s a sauce, Saito says, they also use at chef Odo’s titular kaiseki restaurant next door. All of it gets piled on buns made from the chef’s own recipe, “so their key point is a sense of unity.”
The entire Hall menu is in service of wanting to bring a variety of experiences to New York diners, says chef Odo, and to showcase all the cuisines Japan has to offer. But, he admits, multiple concepts in one space “isn’t the kind of restaurant you could open in Japan.” A cocktail and burger bar, in front of a chef’s counter, next to a kaiseki restaurant? That’s New York.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although far from the European front lines, the then-British colony of Sierra Leone was important to the war effort in both world wars. In World War I, the Royal West African Frontier Force served in operations against German forces in then-Togoland. In World War II, the strategic location of the port of Freetown meant it was fortified and became a critical base for protecting sea routes to the Middle East, India, and Australasia.

The vast majority of these forces were native Africans, many of them Sierra Leonean. Sierra Leoneans served as soldiers in the Frontier Force, and an even larger number served in the Carrier Corps. Combat in the African interior relied on vast quantities of materiel, but a lack of roads and mechanization meant that often the only effective method of transport was on the heads of the Carrier Corps.

Sierra Leonean forces saw combat from East Africa to Italy, and faced a grim death toll. Besides death in combat, many hundreds died of sicknesses including dysentery, tuberculosis, and especially malaria. The Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery honors soldiers who died during service in World War II. The cemetery contains the graves of 70 West African and four British soldiers.]]></summary>

Perhaps, I reasoned, the mercy I showed this fly would return to me tenfold on some later date. I watched the fly zig-zag down my hallways and felt smugly philanthropic. How many flies got to live out the rest of their limited days on Earth in a habitat as temperate and well-attended as my pre-war apartment? Its constant buzzing, especially near my face, was annoying, and a part of me blanched each time my eyes strayed from my food, opening up the possibility for the fly to regurgitate its fly juice on my avocado toast. But these were all small, tolerable, annoyances, I reasoned. How long could a fly possibly live?]]></summary>

This makes a certain degree of sense, as Flagg is a huge destroyer who has been kicking ass for Duke and looking every bit like the sort of prospect who could push NBA defense forward, someone without precedent (in draftese, he's been "demonstrating the myriad ways he affects winning.") But you don't need to be a basketball alien to be cool. Dylan Harper is a hyperskilled operator, the man widely projected to be selected one pick after Flagg, and the most magnetic player in college basketball.
Where Flagg is a somewhat idiosyncratic player, causing open confusion among NBA execs, there's zero uncertainty about the sort of professional Harper will be. He is the consummate modern point guard, someone who looks like he is playing at a pro level already. I don't really understand how college defenders are supposed to guard someone who is 6-foot-6 with a plus-four wingspan and this advanced of a ball-handler with both hands. Harper is the ideal driver, gliding both past and through defenders, who always appear to be flailing like used-car inflatable dancing guys in contrast to Harper's perfect balance. He's also shooting 36 percent from three—not an eye-popping number, but his mechanics are clean, not to mention beautiful, and that figure includes a ton of self-created step-back stuff and his recent hot stretch of 46 percent over the past four games. Harper had his big moment this past weekend, when he nailed a buzzer-beating three to down Seton Hall in an extremely competitive game.]]></summary>

The short answer: that sameness is only pervasive when you only look at what’s promoted by our three-headed social media hegemony (Meta, YouTube, and TikTok).

While it remains impossible to rebuild Juan Soto in the aggregate, "Now we can afford to sign multiple guys" is at least starting to pan out as true, if not necessarily in the hitting department. Of course, this blog is not about Juan Soto.
Last week, the Yankees signed free agent Max Fried to an eight-year, $218 million contract. This at least covered the record-breaking portion of rebuilding Soto's contract in the aggregate, though instead of the more straightforward "biggest contract in MLB history," it came with the qualifiers of being the largest guarantee for a left-handed pitcher. Also like Soto's contract, the contract has a large risk of being player-friendly toward the end—Soto will be 41 when his runs out; Fried is currently 30 with a spotty injury history—but the Yankees front office, like the Mets', will only cry about the final years if the team doesn't make some deep runs in the first few.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://crosswordracing.com/crosswords/2024-12-16-19-0-42d9-frontpage.html"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN, I’ve been working on this multiplayer crossword for a while now. There’s still so much more on my todo list for it, but I think it’s time to launch and get some feedback with what I have.
Every hour, a new crossword (13×13 or 15×15) is generated at https://crosswordracing.com If you prefer smaller/faster, every ten minutes, a new mini crossword (7×7 or 11×11) is generated at https://crosswordracing.com/mini
You’re playing each crossword at the same time as everyone else, racing to complete it first. You can’t see what you’ve got right, until you correctly complete the entire grid. But you get some fun feedback on what other players are doing: a cell turns green if one other player has correctly solved it, orange if two other players have, and red if three or more other players have entered the correct letter in that cell.
Chat is emoji-only for the first half of the game (i.e. 30 minutes for the front-page, 5 minutes for the mini). After that, it unlocks and you can chat freely.
If you’re not done when the next crossword is generated, you can just stay on the current page for as long as you like and keep working to solve it.
I didn’t manage to get user accounts done before my arbitrarily-imposed launch date, so everyone is anonymous for now. I definitely want to build accounts, streaks, trophies, etc. The other big thing I’m excited to build is a “team mode”. You should be able to play on a team, where you can chat freely with your team-mates, and the cell colors indicate what the other team has (collaboratively) got correct. I think that would be a lot of fun.
Thanks for reading, checking it out, and for any feedback. Feel free to ask me anything, of course.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I honestly hate freelancing because it often feels unclear and stressful when starting new jobs, especially when employers aren’t sure what they want.
For the past few years, I’ve focused on specific projects like mobile chat apps using Flutter. With my existing codebase and experience, these jobs are easier and less stressful. I usually sell my codebase and move on.
However, finding these types of jobs is challenging. I tried many Upwork alert apps, but they either don’t work well or have over 95% false positives.
That’s why I created UpHunt. With UpHunt, you can create multiple profiles, and AI will match your profiles with Upwork jobs. You’ll receive instant notifications and can be the first to apply.
It's still a completely free project. I just need to hear your thoughts and feedback!

Injuries, a lack of depth, a weak offensive line, and an uncharacteristically flat offense have all combined to make this one of the least-impressive one-loss teams in memory. But wins are all that matters, and when the playoffs start the most important thing for the Chiefs will be that they have the best quarterback in football, who has found a way to win when it counts, even when it requires a little demon magic along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We created autonomous AI Agents that monitor the stock market for you while you go about your day.
How it works:
Tell our AI Assistant what you want to monitor, and it creates a project for our team of autonomous AI Agents. You'll get notifications (email + app) when significant events matching your criteria are detected. For short-term projects, you'll be notified when your analysis is ready.
Behind the scenes:
When you give the AI Assistant a request to monitor an entity (like a stock or group of stocks), an AI Project Manager plans the project and breaks the project down into manageable tasks. These tasks run asynchronously - some recurring (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly), others one-time.
Example prompts you can try:
Long-term monitoring:
- "Monitor Apple stock and notify me of any important events and red flags"
- "Monitor Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta stock. Notify me if any of them start trending toward being undervalued"
Short-term analysis:
- "Create a project to analyze the last 30 earnings calls for Tesla, spot trends, and how the business has evolved over time"
You can track the progress of all tasks as the AI Agents work in the background.
Try it here: https://decodeinvesting.com/chat
This is still an early version - we're actively improving it based on feedback. Would love to hear what you think and what features you'd want to see next!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN,
We’re excited to share PySpur, an open-source tool that provides a graph-based interface for building, debugging, and evaluating LLM workflows.
Why we built this:
Before this, we built several LLM-powered applications that collectively served thousands of users. The biggest challenge we faced was ensuring reliability: making sure the workflows were robust enough to handle edge cases and deliver consistent results.
In practice, achieving this reliability meant repeatedly:
1. Breaking down complex goals into simpler steps: Composing prompts, tool calls, parsing steps, and branching logic.  
2. Debugging failures: Identifying which part of the workflow broke and why.  
3. Measuring performance: Assessing changes against real metrics to confirm actual improvement.
We tried some existing observability tools or agent frameworks and they fell short on at least one of these three dimensions. We wanted something that allowed us to iterate quickly and stay focused on improvement rather than wrestling with multiple disconnected tools or code scripts.
We eventually arrived at three principles upon which we built PySpur :
1. Graph-based interface: We can lay out an LLM workflow as a node graph. A node can be an LLM call, a function call, a parsing step, or any logic component. The visual structure provides an instant overview, making complex workflows more intuitive.  
2. Integrated debugging: When something fails, we can pinpoint the problematic node, tweak it, and re-run it on some test cases right in the UI.   
3. Evaluate at the node level: We can assess how node changes affect performance downstream.
We hope it's useful for other LLM developers out there, enjoy!

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42433683</id>

        <updated>2024-12-16T18:19:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been on the job hunt for the past few months and after going through numerous reddit threads and Linkedin posts I saw that customized resumes make a huge difference in getting callbacks. But every tool I tried was either bloated with 50+ features I didn’t need or way too expensive (some were charging $70/month!). These people think I'm made of money!
So I decided to build my own AI resume builder.
It’s simple and streamlined:
It takes your resume and the job post and generates  a custom resume tailored to that post. (We do not store your resume or use it to train the AI)
What used to take me 20-30 minutes now takes 30 seconds.
I’ve gotten callbacks from companies like Apple, Nvidia, Meta, and Amazon using it.
The pricing is designed to be accessible: the more jobs you apply to, the cheaper it gets — around $2 per resume.
I'd love for you to try it out and let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Barcelona is one of the most visited cities in the world—and given its abundance of urban beaches, cultural institutions, and striking Gaudí-designed masterpieces, justifiably so. But while the city is famous for its restaurants, much of what makes its cuisine so unique has been lost in the rush of international brands and blandly Spanish dining concepts meant to appeal to tourists and digital nomads.

To this day, Barcelona’s identity is tied to Catalonia, a semi-autonomous region with its own language, culture, anthem, and gastronomy. Despite being part of Spain for well over five centuries, Catalan people are still fiercely proud of their own distinct traditions. When it comes to the food, that means here you’ll encounter dishes combining meat and seafood (as well as meat and fruit) fo…]]></summary>

Smash burgers are a menu slam dunk. Is that a good thing?
 I can’t remember the last time I saw a burger that didn’t have a lacy edge. I know they still exist out there, half-pound bistro burgers oozing with juice, but these are not the burgers that trend, the burgers that beckon obsession on TikTok. No, the burgers I am told I want are meaty doilies, pressed nearly paper thin, ground beef fried to a crisp.
Over the past five years or so, smash burgers have grown in national popularity. But 2024 was the year they officially peaked — and maybe jumped the shark. A genuine creativity around incorporating new flavors into smash burgers has made the inevitable turn into a mandatory menu addition for every place that is trying to be the next big thing.

Orders from last week started going out over the weekend, and hundreds more are shipping today.
It’s too late now to get an order in for Christmas, no matter where you live, but it’s not too late to place an order from this batch of shirts and hoodies. But, we’ll probably close the store to new orders tomorrow (Tuesday), so don’t wait. My sincere thanks to everyone who’s bought one (or in many cases, more than one).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Malmö harbor, a cone-shaped concrete relic of World War II-era architecture rises above the former dockyard like a giant vertical cigar: the Spetsbunker, a towering 60-foot (18-meter) bomb shelter. 

The bunker’s construction around 1940 solved a significant challenge for the nearby then-bustling shipyard: the waterlogged, unstable ground made underground shelters impractical. Designed to protect up to 150 workers, the structure, however, ultimately went unused, as Sweden remained largely untouched by the war.

While relatively common in wartime Germany, this type of above-ground bunker is believed to be the only one of its kind in Sweden. Drawing on the pioneering work of engineer Leo Winkel, known for creating Winkeltürme (“Winkel Towers”) or Spitzbunker (“Pointed Bunkers”), the structure embodies both functionality and creativity. 

The air raid shelter’s tall, narrow, circular base, with a metal-reinforced pointed top, was crafted to be nearly invisible to enemy bombers and exceptionally difficult to destroy. Even a direct hit would cause the payload to glance off the surface, rather than penetrating the walls.

Overgrown with vines, the Spetsbunker remains a stoic sentinel. Though closed to the public, its weathered interior features a spiral staircase, platforms, and a central shaft with a winch. Its distinctive silhouette continues to serve as both a historical landmark and a reminder of wartime innovation.]]></summary>

There’s a lot going on this time of year, and a trip to the mall definitely won’t make you feel any less stressed out about getting everything checked off your to-do list.
But there is a foolproof solution that doesn’t involve making a frantic, last-minute shopping trip: just give the recipient you have in mind a really great food subscription box. It’s both an easy gift and a win-win: Your recipient gets to open a present multiple times over the course of the next year, and you’ll also save yourself several headaches by jumping online and ordering something to be shipped directly to their door instead of fight…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So it's agreed, then: The only Super Bowl that America should demand after the year we've all had is Bills-Lions. It has all the elements we think we deserve—points, absurd plays, points, easily caricatured main characters, points, long-to-the-point-of-seemingly-interminable-suffering fan bases, points, a coach who wants all his linemen to have touchdowns, more points, another coach who has been slagged repeatedly for not reaching let alone winning the big one, additional points, the MVP and the Coach Of The Year if you're into that sort of thing, further points, towns that fight the odds just by getting out of bed every day, another round of points, drunks jumping through furniture, and one final round of points.
Now comes the hard part, which is coming to grips with the likelihood that we likely won't get Bills-Lions again, and having the fortitude and dignity to refuse to watch whatever matchup the National Football League tries to pretend we'd rather have instead. In other words, if it ain't Bills-Lions, we must cancel the parties, refuse to get dressed on game day, and hate-watch the Puppy Bowl instead. If we can't get it together to do the right thing in November, we may as well give it an honest go in February.]]></summary>

The French company Penarroya initiated the mining operations in 1927. From 1928 to the 1960s, these mines yielded tens of thousands of tons of lead annually, employing hundreds of workers who extracted resources from dynamite-blasted tunnels—an industrial technique now banned in Morocco.

At about 1.5 kilometers from the entrance, the main tunnel splits into two and narrow shafts dart off in several directions, with ladders and pulleys connecting to shafts at shallower and deeper levels. There are also some larger chambers used for storing disused trolleys, mining tools, and basic amenities for the miners, including a makeshift shower.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Socratify is an AI coach for early stage professionals to sharpen their critical thinking and verbal communication skills
Ever since ChatGPT came out, I've been using it to debate and learn new ideas. Having a short insightful conversation where AI coaches you can be powerful but it's hard to get right with a general purpose chat LLM because they don't propose stories, lack context and don't track progression
I'm building Socratify with the hypothesis that a product built around AI questioning humans and proposing interesting questions daily can be 100x more rewarding than book summaries and other passive content.
Inspired by Charlie Munger's concept of a latticework of models that you apply to new situation. Socratify teaches you a concept (e.g., Disruption), discusses a situation where it's applicable, (e.g., Google vs. Perplexity) and gives you feedback as well as the strongest counterargument
Checkout the first release at https://www.socratify.com/
Appreciate thoughts from the HN community and would love to learn what you would want from an AI coach that makes you better every day

If you are looking to impress a tea friend or matcha enthusiast, this is the matcha I would suggest. It toes the line between being fancy and flavorful without having an appalling price tag. Its deep green hue is an indicator of the high-quality matcha each tin provides, but if that doesn’t convince you, the aroma — and flavor — will. This matcha is rich, floral, and subtly sweet but rounded out by mild bitterness. It’s delicious drunk straight because the matcha is already so smooth, but I also find it adds the perfect earthy bite to matcha lattes. I love to pair it with warm milk and a drizzle of vanilla bean paste for a fragrant matcha latte that is arguably better than any of the pale, $8 versions you might order at a coffee shop. One warning: Once you try this matcha, you can never go back to the cheaper stuff (nor will you want to, anyway).



No peeking! But check out what the Eater Advent Calendar has already revealed.  And check back each day for a new clutch condiment, gadget, or nibble that, yes, makes an amazing gift — but these surprises are just for you.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN,
I Introduce a library of type-safe URL builder that can be used in the Blazor project.
Blazor is a cool technology that makes it easy for anyone to write modern web in C#, but I found it lacking in features around URLs.
Similar projects already exist, but this library is
* Compatible with razor's source generator (the previous one had to explicitly turn this off with the advent of .NET6)
* Automatic generation of @page, [Parameter], and [CounterWithQuery] attributes (handwriting is very tedious, right?)
* Automatic generation of highly customizable menu structures (icons, descriptions, L10N, all possible!)
Happy hacking!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Conclave, currently playing both in theaters and on demand, is the kind of movie that will generate almost all of its long-term business from its ending. Yes, it will be nominated for, and perhaps win, a whole shitload of Oscars. And yes, DOP Stephane Fontaine’s camerawork deserves one of those Oscars. If you want two hours of sumptuous Vatican porn (and the mood strikes me more often than you’d imagine), Fontaine and director Edward Berger deliver a movie with multiple frames that are literally suitable for framing. Put those shots in a fucking museum.
But that ain’t what anyone’s gonna talk about coming out of the theater. What everyone is gonna talk about is, “Oh wow, can you believe that ending?” And if you haven’t seen it Conclave yet, you’ll be besieged by satisfied customers encouraging you to experience its endgame for yourself. We’re still in the Spoiler Zone for this film, so I can’t and won't talk more about how Conclave’s plot resolves itself. Nor do I want to, because my opinion—and it’s only mine—is that it was corny and stupid.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a kind of hush that is specific to old-growth suburbs, a quietness that is more vast and more inherent than any disturbance that kind of place can kick up. The place where I grew up is different in some ways than it was when I was growing up there, but that fundamental quiet is undisturbed. Things happen and make their various sounds—you'll hear a quick blurt of music when someone steps out of a bar to smoke or as people come and go from one of the restaurants downtown, cars go by and dogs get bossy on their walks and freight trains chug and honk over the New Jersey Transit lines when the commuter trains aren't running. People still live there, and people make noise. The part that is striking, and which is striking to me whenever I go back to see my parents in the house where I grew up, is how the totality of that suburban quiet swallows all this up. It's there and then it is gone, and there is maybe the wind in the trees or just nothing at all.
I have lived in noisy places for longer than I ever lived in all that quiet, but the appeal of it isn't lost on me. I like how dark it gets at night there, and I like walking back from the train station down those quiet sidewalks and through all the old extraneous shortcuts of my youth. The last few times I've done this I have startled some deer standing around in a parking lot, as aimless and wary as I was when I did the same thing as a teenager; they stared at me but did not run. I am aware that it is a nice place to live and it was on balance a perfectly fine place to grow up. I understand why people live there. I am also under no illusions about how quickly and how thoroughly I would go insane if I were to try to do it again.]]></summary>

Joy in Marriages with ADHD

Date night!
We all love the concept.  But I hear many complaints from non-ADHD partners that they are tired of being in charge of date night.  Their ADHD partner 'never seems to get around to planning any.'  I get the disappointment, though I also push back sometimes and suggest that those with the executive functioning skillset might be well-suited to doing that planning if they don't take the lack of involvement from the ADHD personally.
However, here is another approach that might get a bit more attention from ADHD partners - Alphabet Date Night.  I ran into this concept online and loved it immediately because it's so FUN!  It also hits on two ADHD motivational strengths - gamification and 'new'.  
The idea is that you cycle through the alphabet selecting dates that start with different letters of the alphabet to keep things fresh.  Only use any given letter once in a 26-date cycle.  Some examples:
A


apple picking
alpacas (at the zoo)
aquarium
art exhibit
B
basketball game
basket exhibit
boating/boats
biking
beach
C
car show
cycling
cat bar (where you have lunch with cats - yes, it's a thing)
cooking (together; take a class; go to a cooking shop and pick out one thing for your kitchen)
comedy (movie; club; take an improv class together)
You get the idea.  You can look up lists of alphabet dates online...or you can have the fun of making your own.  Post it online in a joint document or on a bulletin board somewhere in your house and add to it as you think of new ideas.
So much fun!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In accordance with New York Athletic Club bylaws, any defensive player who wins the Heisman must be a dual threat player: one who also takes enough snaps on offense to remind voters of the QBs and RBs those voters like to vote for, and who normally win this award. That’s how legendary Michigan CB Charles Woodson secured the Heisman in 1997 (over betting favorite Peyton Manning), and it’s how Colorado CB/WR Travis Hunter edged out Boise State RB Ashton Jeanty for the honor on Saturday night. Hunter is even more of an offensive threat than Woodson was, amassing 92 receptions and 1,152 yards on offense this season while also serving as the Buffaloes’ shutdown corner. This man is a special talent, and the NFL Draft will reward him for it.
Now let’s talk about Hunter’s coach, who’s a total asshole.]]></summary>

Those are two jobs that professional fat guys are never entrusted with, although Sewell is a talented guy who has already proven himself a capable receiver. More to the point, who doesn’t get off seeing a 300-pound man doing shit normally reserved for men 100 pounds lighter?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another week with another outstanding indie developer whom I’m delighted to thank for sponsoring DF. This week, it’s Sophiestication Software promoting the return of CoverSutra — a previous hit from the “delicious” era of Mac apps that is now back and better than ever.
After over a decade, the rejuvenated (reanimated?) CoverSutra has been reimagined as a sleek, standalone music player for your Mac that lives in your menu bar, giving you seamless access to your music library. Instantly search by album, artist, or song — all without breaking your workflow. Some of what’s new:
Standalone music player: No Music app required.
Instant music search: Find tracks anytime, anywhere.
Global keyboard shortcuts: Control playback from any app.
Available now on the Mac App Store for just $4.99 — and a free upgrade for CoverSutra 3.0 customers. Five bucks, one time, and it’s yours to keep. And it’s just so polished, so simple, and so nice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After being sold out for months, the upcoming sponsorship schedule at DF is wide open at the moment — including the final two weeks of the year. I know sponsors are sometimes hesitant to book weeks around major holidays, but, well, Daring Fireball is never “closed”. And traffic to the site is remarkably consistent even during weeks like Thanksgiving and Christmas. Nerds get bored and want to read interesting stuff.
Q1 2025 weeks are wide open too, but I only just now opened those weeks on the calendar.
Weekly sponsorships have been the top source of revenue for Daring Fireball ever since I started selling them back in 2007. They’ve succeeded, I think, because they make everyone happy. They generate good money. There’s only one sponsor per week and the sponsors are always relevant to at least some sizable portion of the DF audience, so you, the reader, are never annoyed and hopefully often intrigued by them. And, from the sponsors’ perspective, they work. My favorite thing about them is how many sponsors return for subsequent weeks after seeing the results.
If you’ve got a product or service you think would be of interest to DF’s audience of people obsessed with high quality and good design, get in touch. And again, this coming week remains open, and the week after. I’m even offering those two weeks at a holiday discount.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jack in the Box's Sourdough Smashed Jack features a quarter-pound smashed beef patty, American cheese, pickles, grilled onions, and Boss Sauce (a burger sauce that's also found on the Smashed Jack) served on grilled sourdough rounds.

I paid $8.59 for one and it's basically the Smashed Jack but one grilled sourdough rather than a brioche bun. For whatever reason, they fully wrapped the burger and then placed it in a clamshell box.


The beef patty offered a robust meaty flavor. It was thick but just a tad short in width to achieve full bread coverage. The grind was a little too fine for a burger. There was a nice browned crust on the patty but none of the crunch you might get from a smashed patty. The temperature was warm rather than hot.



The sourdough rounds were not sour at all and only lightly crispy. They were mostly soft and chewy.
The American cheese was thoroughly melted and gooey.



The pickles and onions combined to provide a watery crunch. The onions were lightly sweet while the pickles added a dose of acidity. Tying it together with a combination of savory and sweet notes was the Boss Sauce.



Overall, Jack in the Box's Sourdough Smashed Jack presented a solid burger that felt pricey for what you get.

        <updated>2024-12-14T00:28:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joe Rossignol, MacRumors:
Apple plans to stop selling the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and
third-generation iPhone SE in European Union countries later this
month, to comply with a regulation that will soon require
newly-sold smartphones with wired charging to be equipped with a
USB-C port in those countries, according to French blog
iGeneration. All three of these iPhone models are still
equipped with a Lightning port for wired charging.
In a paywalled report today, the website said the iPhone models
will no longer be sold through Apple’s online store and retail
stores in the European Union as of December 28, which is when the
regulation goes into force.
It was never clear to me whether this regulation only applied to new devices, or to existing ones. But I guess it applies to existing ones. Until the expected next-gen iPhone SE ships early next year, the lowest-priced new iPhone in the EU will be the iPhone 15, which starts at $700 in the U.S. and around €860 in Europe. (Apple’s prices vary slightly between EU countries.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nifty new convert-to-Markdown library from a small indie development shop named Microsoft:
The MarkItDown library is a utility tool for converting various
files to Markdown (e.g., for indexing, text analysis, etc.)
It presently supports:
PDF (.pdf)
PowerPoint (.pptx)
Word (.docx)
Excel (.xlsx)
Images (EXIF metadata, and OCR)
Audio (EXIF metadata, and speech transcription)
HTML (special handling of Wikipedia, etc.)
Various other text-based formats (csv, json, xml, etc.)
The API is simple:
from markitdown import MarkItDown

markitdown = MarkItDown()
result = markitdown.convert("test.xlsx")
print(result.text_content)

Via Stephan Ango (CEO of the excellent, popular Markdown writing and note-taking app Obsidian), who also points out that Google Docs added Markdown export a few months ago. I’ve never used Google Docs other than to read documents created by others, but MarkItDown seems like a library I might make great use of. “MarkItDown” is even a great name. What a world.
Not bad for a 20-year-old syntax.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ryan Christoffel, also at 9to5Mac:
There are two key features that are part of iOS 18.2,
but aren’t yet ready for the Mac:
Genmoji
Mail app redesign
Genmoji are an especially unfortunate omission, as they’re
available on both iPhone and iPad with iOS and iPadOS 18.2.
Meanwhile the Mail app redesign is currently iPhone-exclusive, so
it’s missing from both the Mac and iPad in these next software
updates.
The omission of Genmoji creation in MacOS 15.2, and the omission of the new AI inbox categorization features in Mail on both iPad and Mac, aren’t surprises — they weren’t in any of the betas for these .2 OS updates. But it is a weirdly glaring omission. Apple itself started promoting screenshots of the Apple Intelligence inbox categorization in Mail for Mac back in October, when the .1 OS updates shipped with the initial round of Apple Intelligence features.
I am reliably informed that the new Mail categorization features are coming soon to iPad and Mac, which I suspect means in the .3 updates. But the first .3 betas aren’t out yet.

The new Apple Intelligence features lead the list, and certainly lead Apple’s marketing, but there’s quite a bit else new in 18.2 too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since skateboarding first emerged in the 1940s and 50s, the sport has evolved a lot. The boards are more advanced and the tricks are bigger, faster, and more complex. One thing that hasn't changed much over time though, is the urge to put art on the bottom of the boards. You can see this in the collection at the Geneva Skateboard Museum, which showcases boards from different eras of skateboarding.

The museum is made and run by Jim Zbinden, who has had the dream of this museum in mind for nearly 30 years. The first iteration of the museum came in the early 2000s. Hundreds of skateboards were displayed to show the intricate and unique art that has been a part of skateboarding culture for the last seven decades. 

In the museum's current location, you'll find three floors where each inch of wall and ceiling space is covered with skateboards and skateboard paraphernalia. The collection has everything from old used boards to new display boards to boards that belonged to famous skaters like Tony Hawk. This makes the museum interesting even for those who have never touched a skateboard in their lives.]]></summary>

At the State Correctional Institution at Huntingdon, Luigi Mangione reportedly has dinner options of chicken Parmesan or pizza beans, which sounds a lot like the beloved Smitten Kitchen recipe
 CNN’s Jean Carroll seemed sort of confused. While reporting on Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old accused of killing UnitedHealth CEO Brian Thompson, she noted that in his confinement at the State Correctional Institution at Huntingdon in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, he had the choice for dinner between “chicken Parmesan and something called pizza beans.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Watch enough Hannah Hidalgo games on TV, and you’ll grow used to hearing that she plays with “joy.” Glee, I could see. Abandon, sure. But joy feels too clean and delicate a word to describe the way Hidalgo conducts herself on a basketball court: the mean mug, the wagged tongue, after a parabolic pull-up three. The screams. The screams! There is so much screaming: when she finds a teammate on the run, when she launches into someone’s shoulder at the rim, topples to the ground, and draws a foul. They convince me less of her “love for the game” than of her pure, uncut hatred for opponents.
Forget shoulder shrugs or sly smiles; Hidalgo exists on a higher plane of expression. Never has a player been so delighted to demoralize. (Perhaps I’m projecting this malevolence on account of her Instagram stories, which range from bland disavowals of same-sex marriage to the somewhat more intriguing claim that Britney Spears, Katy Perry, Beyoncé and Ariana Grande “ARE ALL WITCHES” whose music is “satanic inspired” and “designed to pull you away from the creator.” Give her credit for consistency: She’s a nut on and off the court.)]]></summary>

Coming off of three unremarkable but respectable seasons in Spain, and at a crossroad of sorts in a career nearing but not yet in its final leg, Memphis Depay went left. Rather than join any of the usual suspects in one of Europe's major leagues, the Dutch forward opted instead to go to Brazil to play for Corinthians.
It is true that it wasn't exactly clear what the next logical step for Memphis's career would be. If redemption in the eyes of the greater soccer world was what he'd been after at Barcelona and Atlético Madrid, a chance to return to the elite and avenge himself for the lasting damage his Manchester United flameout did to his reputation, he didn't get it. So where to next? His fame, pedigree, age, status with the national team, and ambitions made for a peculiar mix, narrowing his potential options.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ghost Lore Museum in Jiufen, Taiwan, explores Taiwan’s rich traditions of ghost stories, superstitions, and afterlife beliefs. Located in Jiufen—a mountain town famous for its mist-shrouded scenery, narrow alleyways, and vibrant tea houses—the museum immerses visitors in the spiritual and supernatural aspects of Taiwanese culture.

While the museum only includes a couple of rooms, it is full of items and statues that showcase the diverse types of spirits and ghosts prominent in Taiwanese and East Asian folklore. It features iconic spirits like the gui (ghosts of those who suffered an unjust or tragic death) and jiangshi (the “hopping” vampires of Chinese myth). Explanatory panels accompany life-sized models, artifacts, and illustrations, offering a glimpse into the roles these spirits play in Taiwanese belief systems and rituals. Hidden inside a cabinet, a grotesque Krasue—a Southeast Asian demon with the internal organs exposed and connected to a flying female head—welcomes the visitor by repeating what they said while opening the door.

One of the highlights is the depiction of the Hungry Ghost Festival, an important event in Taiwan and other East Asian countries, when it’s believed that the gates of the underworld open, allowing spirits to visit the living. This exhibit showcases offerings, lanterns, and other ceremonial objects used to appease wandering souls, along with life-sized models that recreate festival scenes.

The museum displays a collection of traditional talismans, amulets, and symbols that people use to ward off evil spirits or attract good luck, especially related to Taoism. Visitors can learn about the symbolism behind each item and how they’re used in rituals to protect against misfortune or mischief from vengeful spirits, including a sword made of coins used by Taoist exorcists.

The place is built as an open photo booth, where visitors can take pictures while using the items around, lying inside coffins, or joining a set of heads inside jars.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gladiator II, Ridley Scott's sequel to Ridley Scott's Gladiator, is neither a good movie nor a bad movie—instead, it is easily one of the most movies in recent memory. Overstuffed and overacted (these are not complaints, mind you), Gladiator II has so much going on that the presence of (spoilers beyond this point) frickin' sharks in the frickin' Colosseum doesn't even make its Wikipedia summary. But look beyond the excesses of the film—easier said than done, given that a gladiator riding a rhinoceros like a surfboard appears not even halfway through—and there's another story here, one about how the politics of these films changed dramatically between the 2000 original and its 2024 sequel, and what that change says about the stories that America can still believe about itself.
In Gladiator, Rome is a civilizing force (the opening battle is a victory over barbarian tribes), and is on the verge of peacefully transitioning back to a republic. This version of Rome is a fundamentally virtuous nation that is threatened when Commodus, a vain and selfish degenerate, takes the reins of power instead of Maximus, the Cincinnatus-like humble general chosen by the dying emperor to return republicanism to the empire, who is subsequently exiled. It is essentially a late–Clinton-era narrative about America: A proud state has been brought low by the peccadillos of a flagrantly libertine leader who habitually disrespects the military, and the only way to return the nation to glory is for a morally upstanding political outsider (not one of those hated "career politicians") to defeat and remove this dishonorable interloper. And when Maximus completes his task and lays dying—term limited by Commodus's dagger—he demands that power be returned to the Senate. Even in death, Maximus was an institutionalist.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While virtually every city has a tree that can claim to be the oldest, not many have a story as interesting as the one in Paris. Located in Square René Viviani within sight of the Notre Dame, an ancient black locust tree grows behind a wire fence. Surrounded by vibrant moss and saplings, its age is given away by the (somewhat poorly) camouflaged concrete struts that help support its heavier branches.

Something surprising about the oldest tree in the French capital is that it's not actually French. It was brought from Appalachia by the Parisian botanist Jean Robin, who found that many North American plants were suited to the temperate French climate. The entire genus of locust trees was later named for Robin, giving the Parisian tree the scientific name Robinia pseudoacacia. (The “pseudo” comes from the fact that while similar to acacias, the robinia is not closely related.)

The introduction of these trees to Europe has been somewhat of a mixed bag. It grows fast and strong, so it has been used to repopulate deforested areas and to provide lumber. The flowers are used in a surprising amount of foodstuffs, from teas, pancakes, and fritters to the renowned acacia honey. As they are quite shady, pollution-resistant, and long-lived, they became a popular fixture along city streets. It is this hardiness, however, that also makes it a pest.

In many parts of Europe, uncontrolled black locust growth has made it classified as an invasive species. Australia and South Africa have deemed it a weed. Even in North America, it can be considered invasive as it spreads away from the Appalachian region and converts native grasslands into forests. While there have been efforts to eliminate the spread of black locust to areas where it isn’t wanted, Paris does its best to keep its patient zero alive. The crutches that hold up its branches give the impression that the old tree might be a couple of centuries past its prime. Time will tell how long it holds its impressive title.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perched on a hillside with sweeping views over the River Derwent, Alexandra Battery offers a glimpse into Hobart’s colonial past. Built between 1880 and 1882, during a time of international anxiety, the battery was part of a network designed to protect the city’s bustling port from the threat of invasion, especially from the Russians, who had a habit of turning up unannounced, much to the locals’ alarm. Back then, two unanticipated Russian warships anchored in the Derwent, sending shockwaves through Hobart and giving the military planners an urgent push to shore up the city’s defenses.

Alexandra Battery was one of several fortifications established around the river, forming a protective triangle designed to ward off any would-be invaders. Crafted from repurposed stone salvaged from dismantled older batteries, it combined practicality with a prime position, offering uninterrupted sightlines across the river. Though the cannons never saw combat, the battery’s presence provided a sense of security in a world of shifting alliances and growing naval power.

Now a public park, Alexandra Battery is a place where visitors can explore its atmospheric tunnels and storerooms, imagining a time when artillery and ammunition filled the space.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why is Bill Belichick the new head football coach for the University of North Carolina? Reporting done by The Athletic's Jeff Howe, combined with the fact that no professional team offered Belichick a job last offseason, would indicate that Belichick was forced into a college job because the NFL no longer wants him. But sources close to the man himself would like to tell a different story, and have done so through ESPN's Seth Wickersham. No, the NFL didn't turn its back on Belichick; he turned his back on it. "This is a big fuck you to the NFL," is how one of Belichick's confidants described the decision to Wickersham.
OK, sure. It doesn't really matter if any of us believe that a guy who is just 15 victories away from breaking Don Shula's all-time wins record willingly walked away from the NFL in order to coach football at a basketball school. What matters is that Belichick, and the people around him, seem to truly believe that.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Barcelona is positioned on the Mediterranean Ocean, but its culinary influences come from a variety of places, including inland Spain. For a cuisine that’s even more overtly Mediterranean, it’s necessary to head to the Balearic Islands. If your visit to Barcelona doesn’t allow time for the ferry ride, consider a meal at Na Mindona.

Located in Raval, Barcelona’s immigrant neighborhood, this tiny restaurant specializes in the cuisine of Mallorca, the largest of the Balearic Islands. Although Barcelona is the mainland point with the most connections to the islands, Na Mindona is one of only a scant handful of places in the city that serves some of these dishes. 

The ever-changing chalkboard menu at Na Mindona has something of a dual nature. On the one hand, there’s an emphasis on offal-fo…]]></summary>

 Finding the time to leave the house and actually go holiday shopping might seem next to impossible. But there’s a way to make things more efficient: While you’re making the Herculean effort to pick up a take-out noodle soup or a cart full of groceries at your local Chinese, Japanese, or Korean supermarket, know that options for holiday shopping are all over the aisles. Broadly speaking, the housewares, beauty, and stationery sections at these stores are full of great gift ideas, particularly in the “stocking stuffer” category — and particularly if your recipient is really into food.
This online shopping guide obviously negates the whole point of picking up extra items while you’re buying groceries, but should serve as inspiration the next time you’re pushing a cart down the aisles. If you’re adding these to cart, though, throughout this guide we’ve suggested purchasing from AAPI-owned businesses alongside the bigger box retailers where possible, to keep the original spirit of the practice alive. — EDJ

With restaurants trying to cater to the widest possible audience, why do so many still miss the mark with vegan and vegetarian food?
 No one walks into a barbecue restaurant or a smash burger joint expecting plentiful plant-based options. But on a beautiful fall Sunday, with a group of friends of various dietary needs, I did not expect to walk into a pub in tony Brooklyn and see nary a vegan item on the menu. Not even the fries, which came with aioli instead of ketchup, and which served as the only vegetarian item on the menu. This was a pub, a style of restaurant which purports to be for every kind of person. The omission was glaring.
Vegan dining has made incredible strides since I had, I’m sorry to say, the worst cake of my life at a high school birthday party. Sad …]]></summary>

I also want to tell you about the goldfish puppet who monologued about his existence for about three times as long as I was expecting. But first I should probably explain at least the basics.
Give Me Carmelita Tropicana!, the final production for Soho Rep in its extremely intimate space on Walker Street, is a delirious supernatural caper written by Alina Troyano and Branden Jacobs-Jenkins. Troyano plays herself and Ugo Chukwu plays Jacobs-Jenkins as they chase the incorporeal title character—a real-life performance persona of Troyano's—through both New York City and a fantasy universe inhabited by Troyano's past characters. Both of the psychedelic experiences I mentioned appear before you in its intermission-free two hours (a good thing; you won't want to escape), along with so much more that can't be done justice as written words, and maybe shouldn't. The momentum and elements of surprise never falter. This is a kaleidoscopic celebration of freedom, of all you can do with craftsmanship, imagination, and an audience willing to join you on the journey.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spain’s Catalonia region has a noble and diverse cheesemaking legacy, with unique cheeses ranging from mató, a cottage cheese often drizzled with honey and eaten at dessert, to tupí, a product made from leftover bits of cheese that have been fermented in a clay pot with booze. 

Barcelona was largely absent from this legacy until 2019, when Italian former veterinarian and self-professed “super lover of cheese” Francesco Cerutti opened Pinullet. Claiming to be the only cheesemaker in Barcelona, Cerutti uses organic milk to produce as many as nine different varieties of cheese right in the city center. 

Every Monday, Cerutti receives a shipment of 1,000 liters of raw milk from a farm with three cows in Cardadeu, a village 40 kilometers northeast of Barcelona. Come Tuesday, the largely self-taught cheesemaker might turn this into a fresh cheese such as queso fresco, a couple Italian-style pasteurized cheeses such as mozzarella or ricotta, and three to four raw milk aged French-style cheeses such as a Camembert- or a Tomme-style cheese. He also produces yogurt and cheeses seasoned with ingredients ranging from truffles to chilies.

Cerutti’s so-called “cheese laboratory” spans a workroom, refrigerators for aging cheese, and a shopfront, where he also sells a few bottles of wine and other products, in addition to those cheeses. These days, he sells the bulk of what he produces to local restaurants.]]></summary>

Whether pumpkin pie or tiramisu, trifle or semifreddo, these desserts adhere to the mantra ‘store-bought is fine’
 If you’re not the best baker in the world, the idea of being asked to bring a dessert to your family’s holiday party can be totally overwhelming. You could, of course, just go to a neighborhood bakery and pick up a great pie or cake, but maybe this is the year you finally go out on a limb and try to make something on your own. 
And really, you don’t have to do it totally alone — as Ina Garten has famously repeated, getting a little store-bought help is fine. The following recipes are all the definition of “semi-homemade,” or dishes that require a little bit of work but also employ a lot of assistance from store-bought ingredients like pre-made…]]></summary>
