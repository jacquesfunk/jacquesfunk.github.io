        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, I remember how it felt to believe. The aching, constant hum that was always inside me. Faith is not always the rare and precious feeling of wonder that arrives without warning, when the nature of the world stretches out in front of you and catches in your throat. That is awe, which can—if you believe—reinvigorate the faithful, remind them of glory and power and majesty. But faith itself is like love: as magical and revolutionary as it is mundane and commonplace.
Real faith exhausts. It demands. It becomes rote even for the most ardent. There is a reason that most churches adopt some kind of liturgy; you cannot reinvent a wheel that must be constantly in use. To believe something with every atom of your being requires you to let it take over. There are only so many awe-inspiring moments in a life; most of a life is sweeping the floor and clicking on the computer and running an errand. Faith is not what you do in a church on Sunday; faith is a whole life.]]></summary>

There wasn't even that much snow, by Lake Erie standards, but Delta Airlines didn't seem to care that I had 10 pounds of potatoes to grate for a Chanukah party the next day and was leaving to visit my mother the day after that. There was no open seat to New York that night, nor the next day until 9:00 p.m. I was stuck. I was despondent.
I had dated a guy from the Cleveland suburbs in my 20s long enough to learn the hard way that there's not all that much to recommend in the city. But I vaguely remembered that locals there love to brag about their art museum, and that seemed like a better way to pass the time than walking forlornly around an empty, windblown downtown. I booked a room in the hotel across the street from the Cleveland Museum of Art. I figured I'd spend an hour breezing through the gallery the next morning and then find something else to distract myself from my plight.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Things are going badly for Barcelona forward Ansu Fati. The 22-year-old's career prospects have been dwindling for something like four straight years, as a succession of leg injuries (and accompanying extended absences) have thrown him miles off the developmental track that once made him one of the world's brightest wonderteens. After returning from an unfruitful loan to Brighton for the 2023–24 season, he now finds himself an afterthought at Barça. Lately he cannot even break into match-day squads. The holder of several records as the youngest-ever goalscorer in this or that competition has not scored or assisted in any competition in more than a year.
If he is to have any realistic chance of rebuilding his career, Fati very clearly needs to leave Barcelona, either on a permanent transfer or an extended loan to a smaller club where he can get lots and lots of playing time. Unfortunately, his gargantuan salary, negotiated several leg-kablooeys ago, makes this a very difficult circle to square. The kind of club that could afford to take on his wage generally would not pay that much for, or dedicate guaranteed buckets of playing time to, such a dubious reclamation project; the kind of club that could guarantee him buckets of playing time would have to mangle its squad salary structure to pay him. Meanwhile you can imagine why a 22-year-old who has had more knee surgeries than completed 90-minute match appearances in the past half decade might balk at the idea of an 80-percent pay cut for the sake of leaving a club he joined as a 10-year-old. It's a tough situation! But that's not really what this blog is about.]]></summary>

I've written plenty about how impressive the Reds have been under Arne Slot this season, and I'm sure I'll write plenty more. The team currently in second place, however, deserves some flowers as well, as Nottingham Forest, the little money tree that could, just finished taking four points from its two matches against that same Liverpool. After handing the league leaders what is still their only league loss of the season back in September, and at Anfield to boot, on Tuesday Forest played hosts and came out with a 1-1 draw that served to further solidify the Trees' table-scaling legitimacy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Monday night, I booted up League Pass to watch the end of Pistons-Knicks, and I was treated to a spectacular finish, with Malik Beasley hitting huge threes and talking wild shit while Cade Cunningham cooked two All-NBA defenders en route to another star-making performance. During a replay review, I flipped over to Warriors-Raptors, where I got to see Buddy Hield legitimate a Chris Boucher masterclass with a signature moment of comedic hubris, the sort only he is capable of. After those games wrapped, I locked in for the fourth quarter of Grizzlies-Rockets, the best frame of the night. There was Ja Morant, nailing halfcourt bombs and frying the most athletic player in the NBA; there was Jalen Green, finishing up an efficient 42-point night and continuing his impressive, important January; and there was Amen Thompson, doing his pure destroyer act.
It was an amazing night of basketball, one that, according to a certain discursive strain, does not matter—or at any rate matters less than the question of how many people watched it on TV. NBA ratings squawking is not a novel phenomenon, nor an interesting one. Every year, the season starts while the World Series and football season are in full swing, and so some people watch those things instead of NBA basketball. And because that happens alongside cable television's general slide into the abyss, the numbers wobble. Then those allergic to context form grandiose theories, mistaking the relative viewership decline for an absolute one and linking it to any number of bogeymen: load management, too many three-pointers, or, most cynically of all, wokeness, which is another word for "black people on my television."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Monday, Italian soccer club Lazio fired its longtime falconer Juan Bernabé after the 56-year-old Spaniard posted photos on social media of, uh, himself following a penile implant surgery. In a statement, Lazio said "[w]e, and the historic symbol of the eagle, can no longer be associated with a person who with his behaviour has made the continuation of any relationship impossible." The club also said it was "stunned" to see the photos. As a result of Bernabé's firing, the club's eagle, Olimpia, will not fly at upcoming matches, as is tradition. Lazio's statement acknowledged the "hurt" that will be felt by the club's fans over Olimpia's absence.
Bernabé, who had been with the club since 2010, was operated on by Lazio's resident urologist, Gabriele Antonini. According to Spanish newspaper El Confidencial, the two met at the club's training ground, Formello. In an interview with Spanish radio station Radio24, Bernabé explained that the implant allows him to control his erections and how long he lasts during sexual activity, explaining that he "has to ejaculate whenever I have some free time." He went on to say that it was a "marvelous surgery" and that his erection is "natural, but with this implant, I can press a button that lets me perfectly control both the erection and the duration." If you're interested in seeing the offending images, let me first me first try to disabuse you of your curiosity, but if that doesn't work, here you go.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The explanations are both tiresome and unsatisfactory. The 14-3 Minnesota Vikings were annihilated 27-9 in their opening playoff game last night against Los Angeles Rams. Two weeks ago, Minnesota was a lone victory away from securing the No. 1 seed in the NFC and the attendant boost in DVOA Super Bowl odds that would come with it. They had one of the best defenses in the NFL. They had Justin Jefferson. They weren’t supposed to be this good, but they were as legit as any other team at the top of the standings.
Most important, they had a quarterback in Sam Darnold who, unlike his predecessor, had developed a knack for shaking off mistakes and making big-boy throws in big-boy moments. For 17 weeks, Darnold was one of the best passers in football. I saw it. I saw him put a 97-yard dagger into San Francisco. I saw him hit the mute button on the Seahawks home crowd with a game-winning rainbow to Jefferson, in the freezing rain. I saw him sweep the Packers and get his own Rudy moment in the locker room afterward. This was the quarterback that Sam Darnold, an impending free agent, was always meant to be.]]></summary>

The final deal exempted 76ers' ownership, Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, from paying property tax over their 30-year lease at the location, and instead required HBSE to make $5 million a year in payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTs) and a $60 million commitment to community benefits such as transit and after-school programs, down from the original $100 million that the council was requesting. The detailed impacts of an arena on the neighborhood and city under that deal can be found here, but in short, team owners Josh Harris and David Blitzer would save anywhere from $97 million to $273 million in tax benefits; the direct heuristic of the Washington Wizards' arena in D.C.'s Chinatown doesn't paint a rosy picture for the community's future. The deal would be far from the worst that a city has borne in terms of new stadium construction, but with potentially very high downside.
Not that any of that is relevant anymore. On Sunday Jan. 12, less than a month after the city council vote, the 76ers announced that they would not be building a new arena in Center City, and will instead remain in South Philly, with plans to construct a new arena within the extant sports complex. The conflict that drove the initial plan to move to Center City—an inability to reach an agreement with the current landlord at the team's Comcast Spectator–owned arena—was miraculously resolved. According to an official press release from the 76ers, the new deal includes Comcast taking a minority ownership stake in the company, plus plans to bring a new WNBA team to the city.]]></summary>

He weathered injuries and training-camp battles at one of the more volatile, confounding positions in football. So his mere appearance in Sunday night’s Wild Card game and his doinked-in game-winning field goal made him an appropriate hero for the Cardiac Commanders, who have now won five straight games on the final play from scrimmage.
As a euphoric London Fletcher put it on the Commanders radio call, Gonzalez “kick[ed] in the door and kick[ed] us into the second round of the playoffs” in the team's 23-20 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. After the game, Gonzalez said he’d been dealing with some hip discomfort during his previous kick, but that he felt good about the attempt as it left his foot. “I’m just a small part of a big plan,” he told reporters, adding that he was excited to get home to his wife and newborn son.]]></summary>

The operative question is: What are the Kings doing differently? I'd like to nominate a stretch of time at the start of the fourth quarter of the game in Boston against the Celtics this past Friday as the most explanatory chunk of play in the short Doug Christie era.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, when not-yet-former-coach Mike McCarthy was denied permission by the Dallas Cowboys to speak to the Chicago Bears about their own perpetually vacant coaching position, it was obvious that the Cowboys wanted to keep him in his current role as the frontman and designated crap-catcher for their carousel of nonsense. And yet it makes perfect sense, and is somehow exactly as obvious, that the Cowboys fired McCarthy on Monday, the next-to-last day of their exclusive negotiating window with him. I mean, that's how you figured it would go, right—one way or another, the team would find the dumbest thing to do, for the dumbest reason, and do it at the dumbest time. That is the Cowboy Way. And when we say "Cowboys," we mean of course Jerry Jones.
Now you may find that firing McCarthy has its merits; this would especially be true if you somehow saw him as the only thing keeping the Cowboys from their true place at the center of the football universe, which is a denial of both logic and Jones's position as owner/general manager/godhead/glowering presence. This past season alone, McCarthy was up for a new deal after going 3-2 in the first five weeks, fired a million times when they lost the next five in succession, guaranteed a new deal a million and one times because the team then won four of their next five games to get to the edge of playoff contention, and then just left to sear evenly on the hot seat because nobody could figure out how to decipher the two losses at the end of their season.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Isaiah Collier is having a rough rookie season for the Utah Jazz. That team stinks real bad: After a cute 2022–23 season of pretending not to tank under then-new team CEO Danny Ainge, the Jazz have decided to suck shit for a while, and entered Sunday's home tilt against the Brooklyn Nets with the second-worst record in the Western Conference. They'll get down to the bottom soon enough, provided Zion Williamson of the New Orleans Pelicans can stay ambulatory for a few weeks. Collier, who was taken by the Jazz with the 29th pick in the 2024 draft, is certainly doing his part.
Collier came to the Jazz from USC, where as a hot-shot one-and-done freshman he shared the spotlight with Bronny James on a distressingly Fortnite-coded operation, earning with his chaotic and eyeball-searingly unethical style of play a reputation as someone you dearly hope will never wear the jersey of your favorite professional hoops team. Collier entered Sunday's home game against the Brooklyn Nets shooting 32 percent from the floor and 16 percent on three-pointers, and turning the ball over on more than a third of his possessions. Attention to detail is not yet a strength of his game. This all suits the purposes of a team that wants to lose, even if it sometimes drives his coach and veteran teammates to hysterics.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In some ways, my worst nightmares about Russell Westbrook joining the Denver Nuggets have come true: He has wormed his way into the starting lineup; he has usurped the point guard position from Jamal Murray; he is shooting the ball quite often; he is shooting threes; Michael Malone loves him. And yet as all of this has happened, as Westbrook's role with the team has grown larger and more important, the Nuggets have gotten ... better? Just what the hell is going on here?
Things didn't start off so well. At the beginning of the season, Westbrook was ensconced in the second unit, and entrusted to keep the offense humming while Nikola Jokic sat on the bench. The non-Jokic minutes have always been a disaster for the Nuggets, but Westbrook was just making things worse. His early-season stints were full of the smoked layups, ill-advised jumpers, and reckless playmaking that came to define his seasons in Los Angeles and marked him as a candidate for ignominious retirement this past offseason. But then injuries started to bite the team, which shuffled Westbrook into the starting lineup, and from there the Nuggets just kind of stopped losing. The 23-15 Nuggets are 13-4 in games that Westbrook has started, and it's not by coincidence. As a starter Westbrook is averaging 15 points, seven rebounds, and eight assists per game. He's also getting two steals per game as a starter, and shooting 53 percent from the field.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quarterbacks are football’s main character; other players don’t have their faces spliced together in increasingly gruesome playoff preview graphics. But in the Chargers–Texans AFC Wild Card game, a fever dream befitting the Saturday afternoon TV window, both teams seemed determined to show the quarterbacks just how little they mattered. 
By the start of the fourth quarter, things were getting downright goofy. Down 23-6 to the Texans and fresh off back-to-back interceptions, Justin Herbert took two quick sacks to set up third-and-forget-about-it inside his own 15. On the next play, rookie receiver Ladd McConkey made a grab in traffic and shook a sticky defensive back loose for an 86-yard house call. Leave it to the Chargers to score a four-point touchdown. Texans special teams blocked the extra point, evidently spooked kicker Cameron Dicker into forgetting the rules of football (he tried batting the ball down as if that might get the play whistled dead), and returned the blocked kick for the first defensive two-point conversion in playoff history. Even when the Chargers offense found the end zone, the Texans defense said it would have to be on their terms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Patriots went 4-13 this season under the stewardship of first-year head coach and former New England linebacker Jerod Mayo. After firing Mayo shortly after the team's final game of the season, the Patriots have landed on a method for improving the team: Replacing Mayo with a different former Patriots linebacker.
Mike Vrabel is your new Patriots head coach. He returns to the organization where he spent eight years as a player and became one of the more annoying avatars of the Patriot Way. That wasn't really his fault—the Patriots fanbase was always going to latch onto a square-jawed white linebacker who occasionally caught touchdown passes from Tom Brady.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The final score of Saturday night's wild card matchup between the Steelers and Ravens indicates a closer game than was had. The Steelers managed to outscore the Ravens 14-7 in the second half, securing a respectable-if-you-squint 28-14 final score. But everything that happened in the second half of this game—all those nice passes Russell Wilson threw to his receivers—was perfunctory, because by halftime the Steelers had already been run over and left for dead.
"Run over" is not a metaphor in this instance. There is simply no other way to describe what happened to the Steelers through the game's first two quarters, in which the Ravens built a 21-0 lead. After the Steelers ended the first drive of the game with a punt, the Ravens went on a 13-play, 95-yard drive that ended in a touchdown and ate just over seven minutes off the clock. The Ravens ran the ball on nine of those 13 plays, and it became immediately clear that the Steelers' defense was incapable of stopping the Ravens' ground attack. Derrick Henry's first big run of the game went for 34 yards and came as the result of a direct snap. It was a play that augured what was to come: The Ravens' offensive line creating huge gaps for Henry to run through, and Henry dishing out physical punishment to any defender brave enough to try and tackle him. I guess you could say Henry used a stiff arm on Minkah Fitzpatrick to gain a few more yards at the end of that run, but it was really more of a punch.]]></summary>
