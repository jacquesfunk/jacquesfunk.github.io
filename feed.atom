        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s all even halfway through the 2024 world chess championship between reigning champion Ding Liren and challenger Gukesh D, as they fight for chess’s highest title over 14 games in Singapore. The champion Ding Liren, coming off a nightmare run of form in 2024, sensationally won the first game with the black pieces, before the 18-year-old phenom Gukesh leveled the scores in Game 3. The other games have featured both exciting and pedestrian draws as the play has lurched between sublime and ridiculous.
Let’s recap games 1-7 of the match, notating moves which actually occurred during the games in bold, and hypothetical variations which did not occur but could have in italics. If you missed out, check out our preview piece before we get started!]]></summary>

Even with the defense getting lit up, 30-something seconds should be enough to hold firm. And then there's the fact that Jared Goff slips immediately upon trying to hand the ball off and nearly blows the play up. But it worked. Dan Campbell's gutsiness prevailed once again.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thursday night's Warriors-Rockets game was a burly, cantankerous example of one of my favorite categories of regular season NBA game: the Double Desperation game. The way it was won, specifically the player who won it, makes the outcome feel more indicative than a normal regular season game. Let me explain.
The regular season is interminable and every team must manage its efforts in Winter to be prepared for the games that matter in Spring, and so not all 82 games are going to be bangers, or even enlivened by extreme physical efforts or bold competitive displays. The schedule dictates that a decent number of games with big rest or travel disparities will tilt one way, and so not all games will feel as significant for both teams. But winning still matters, and like its colleagues such as the National TV Showcase and These Guys Want To Kill Each Other and Check This Shit Out: We Broke Math games, the Double Desperation game is given higher stakes by its participants' circumstances.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Michael Koresky begins his 2004 essay on M. Night Shyamalan’s The Village with a question: Is allegory in American cinema dead? Koresky, perceptive in his diagnosis of the post-millennium American audience as a stunned and stunted one, entertained the possibility that a literate Hollywood cinema was waning because few adults in the country read. Twenty years later, I wonder if there’s also the added element that allegory is difficult to swallow, at once too obvious and too subtle, nothing we haven’t heard before and nothing we want to hear again. 
It’s a dangerous time for a critic, in the wake of an event as seismic as a presidential election, to engage with art when people are trying to inject meaning into cultural objects that don’t have any. This impulse is understandable; most reactions, as I’ve seen people reassure one another online, are understandable in the wake of a traumatic return to a worse status quo. But even that characterization, trauma, feels false, hyperbolic not because there is no threat to what is coming, but because the therapy-speak that saturates so much discourse does everything but engage with, even combat the thing that occasions trauma. To endeavor to create a substantive allegory out of the social and political elements that cause so much distress at a given time, whether the so-called Trump era or post-9/11, seems foolish, naive, but these are the same descriptors that have stalked Shyamalan’s career from the very beginning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I could count on zero hands the number of Chinese people I met in China who cared about baseball, I would need more than two to count the number of brick-and-mortar MLB stores I saw, simply by wandering around various cities like a normal human being. The first store I entered in Beijing explained some parts of this phenomenon: In China, as elsewhere outside the U.S., MLB is a streetwear brand, not a sports league. Subsequent research filled in the rest: MLB is licensed in East Asia by a South Korean retailer, which has successfully turned it into a billion-dollar enterprise in China.
This means that you can more easily find MLB-branded gear in more styles in China—handbags, puffer coats, eared beanies, puffier(?) baseball caps—than wandering around a city in the United States. The trade-off is extreme limitations in team selection. The streetwear brand's detachment from the actual sport of baseball and its attendant loyalties has odd side effects: In two separate stores, in two separate cities, I encountered window displays of mannequins wearing both Yankees and Red Sox gear. In response to this phenomenon, Barry Petchesky, Yankees fan, offered the following comments: "Oh [no]" and "They love that stupid heart shirt!!" I think it's a sweatshirt, Barry, but I agree with the sentiment. From Samer Kalaf, Red Sox fan: "The duality / Of fan."]]></summary>

Twenty games into the season, the answer is, "Wow. I guess so."
The Nuggets lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers Thursday night, 126-114, in a game that neatly displayed the structural and spiritual issues that currently plague Denver. The Nuggets are 11-9 after winning a franchise-record 57 games last season, and there's no shortage of explanations for the slow start. Nikola Jokic and Aaron Gordon missing games hasn't helped, and neither has Jamal Murray playing like a whisper of his former self. Depth is an issue. The defense is an issue. There are a lot of issues. But in the wake of last night's loss, all of those potential answers feel like red herrings.]]></summary>

Drew, for his part and to his credit, is never self-conscious about it; he really cares about the Vikings like that, and he really follows the fine points of the sport like that, so this is a very natural way for him to talk and be. I am less that way, both because I care about my team of choice so much less and because football is a sport I've always kept at something like arm's length. So it was strange, both during the recording of this week's NFL-heavy episode and in listening back to the finished product, to hear someone who sounds so much like me so obviously enjoying Talking Football like this. Can you be highly interested in something that you're pretty sure you don't entirely like? Given how much I have written about American politics, maybe I shouldn't be surprised that the answer is yes. But I think, here, the proof is very much in the podding.]]></summary>

The fact that those Buckeyes who'd just gotten embarrassed decided to fight the Wolverines over the disrespectful gesture made me roll my eyes. You had 60 minutes to fight, don't start now.
This feeling lasted until later that evening however, when I watched my beloved, terrible Florida State lose to our rivals, the Florida Gators. Which was expected. But when those Gators tried to plant their flag on our logo, I felt my blood boil. And when Florida State's players started fighting to defend our field from desecration, I felt pride—although the team didn't put up much of a fight there, either. But my divergent response to identical acts forced me to ask myself why I suddenly, hypocritically got upset seeing those Gators do what I supported the Wolverines doing. The answer is simple: It's because this still matters. The game, the rivalry, the aftermath, it all matters, to the fans and the players.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For all the intricate sets that earned rookie coach JJ Redick tumescent praise, the confident protestations that this would be a different Los Angeles Lakers team, the relatively well-managed Bronny James circus, and another year of clean health from LeBron James Sr. and Anthony Davis, the Lakers are 22 games into the season currently looking, overall, like a slightly worse version of their derelict 2023-24 squad. Well, that whole-season view may even be slightly generous: On a narrower timeframe, they have looked like one of the worst teams in basketball for two weeks. In the eight games since L.A. has had to play real teams again after crafting a six-game win streak against the league's dross, the Lakers are 2-6 and lost those six games by an average of 21.8 points. Congrats, JJ Redick: You're only one game off the 13-9 pace set by the dearly departed Darvin Ham.
Wednesday night's 134-93 loss to the Miami Heat was the Lakers' most embarrassing effort yet, though the team found it in them to author my favorite defensive possession of the season. Basketball wisdom dictates that defense is a collective endeavor, a postulate typically proven true by good units whose five players respond to each other and move in concert, or by bad individual defenders who can be singled out and, by their individual weakness, compromise the team's solidity. What distinguishes this Lakers possession, from early in the second half, from the familiar genera of blown rotation-style errors is that its failures are genuinely collective. It takes five individuals each making a series of incorrect decisions in rapid succession to produce such an unintentional masterwork.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lonzo Ball has been through hell. This is the very firm impression made by an ESPN story published Thursday and written by Ramona Shelburne and Jamal Collier. Ball has spent most of three years dealing with a persistent injury to his left knee; the knee itself spent much of that time steadily worsening. The injury was characterized by cartilage damage and sharp, overwhelming, hostile pain, the kind of malevolent invading pain that shifts around under the surface, expanding and tunneling and throbbing with its own vile heartbeat. Reading about it makes my skin crawl. Months and months of this shit. Pain that started with an innocuous jammed knee and then blossomed into a debilitating but fundamentally mysterious chronic condition, and which defeated several surgeries and thousands of hours of rehabilitation and physical therapy.
Ball had a cartilage replacement procedure in March 2023, and from that point forward his condition has been steadily improving. This was apparently a risky maneuver, and indeed his surgeon attempted to talk him out of it, on the grounds that it might not work and could even make things worse. It worked, or has worked so far, and Ball is back on the court this season for the Chicago Bulls (more or less; he's missed 16 games with wrist troubles, and has played fewer than 100 total minutes), which is great news and a feel-good story.]]></summary>

While the other major conferences were doing crossover events, the Big Ten gave fans a little early preview this week: Teams play a couple conference games, retreat for variety over the holidays, then return in the new year for the full gantlet. Ohio State, in head coach Jake Diebler's first full season, is looking to shed its underachiever reputation with an experienced roster bolstered by a couple of key transfers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During matchweeks 13 and 14 of the season, the Premier League partners with LGBT charity Stonewall for Rainbow Laces, a campaign to promote LGBT acceptance in soccer, both on the field and in the stands. In practice, this entails some minor cosmetic changes around England's top flight. The league provides clubs with rainbow corner flags, ball plinths, as well as handshake and substitute boards. Most notably, club captains during these games are given the option to wear a rainbow-colored armband, which they are free to decline. This is very much a bare minimum campaign by the Premier League, and one that it has backed away from somewhat; per The Athletic, the league cut the funding of its partnership with Stonewall by about half last December.
However, even the bare minimum is too much for some, which brings us to Crystal Palace captain and England international Marc Guéhi. During Saturday's home match against Newcastle United, which ended in a 1-1 draw, Guéhi wore a rainbow armband that had "I ♡ Jesus" written on it in marker (pictured above). In Palace's next game, a 1-0 away win against Ipswich Town, Guéhi once again wore the rainbow armband, this time with "Jesus ♡ You" written on it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've spent the early chunk of this NHL season disproportionately watching underachieving Eastern Conference teams play listless hockey in front of crowds that seem barely engaged. So the Minnesota Wild's Tuesday night overtime win over the Canucks, against the backdrop of a lively lower bowl, was hockey heaven. Down 2-1 to start the third, a team that missed the playoffs last season and hasn't won a series since 2015 improved upon the league's best record with an equalizer from their big D-man and a last-minute game-winner from possibly the most exciting skater in the sport today. The intensity may not truly start until the new year, but this was as good as early December gets.
The first-period action started a little tentatively, but the Canucks used a power play to their advantage when a Quinn Hughes shot whizzed through traffic to get them on the board. The Wild found their response with a fast-break three-on-one goal off a turnover in the second, but Vancouver stole back momentum just before intermission when newly acquired scoring leader Jake DeBrusk tapped in a rebound.]]></summary>

This is obviously unfortunate. Lore and venting instead spread outward from each person to their own webs of acquaintances, but within the family, drama became taboo. This is neither healthy nor productive for nosy little punks like me. Fortunately for gossips everywhere, some families chatter a lot. Some even consult fortune tellers for life advice. Others simply deal with forbidden subjects in the the good ol' way: lying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a great sequence late in the second quarter of Tuesday night's NBA Cup match between the Orlando Magic and the New York Knicks. Great for a neutral viewer, certainly great if you are a Knicks fan. Less great if you are the fan of the Orlando Magic, but still pretty fun! The Knicks were pulling away from the Magic, up 21 points at about the three-minute mark, and Magic head coach Jamahl Mosley put Moritz Wagner into the game. I assume this substitution was scheduled, but it was also appropriate to the specific moment: the offensive gravity of Knicks center Karl-Anthony Towns was tugging Magic counterpart Wendell Carter Jr. all over the court and largely negating his defensive value, and the Magic were badly losing Carter's minutes. Moe is a change-of-pace type of player, both because he exemplifies try-harderism and because he is happy to play the pest and work his way under an opponent's skin. And Mosley needed someone to upset the rhythm of the game: This may have been an early-December contest but the depleted Magic needed to manage the final margin in order to advance in the tournament, a dynamic that juiced up the competition all the way to the final buzzer.
Wagner came on, worked a dribble hand-off with his brother Franz, then immediately re-screened Franz's defender and chugged into the paint, where he received a slick feed on the go and banked in a quick layup. The set had some nice flowing Wagner-to-Wagner chemistry, and Towns, who'd been exploited by the quick screens and darting action, seemed slightly annoyed. Seconds later, on the Knicks' ensuing possession, Towns made himself a little too angular setting an off-ball screen on the wing and wiped out Franz, earning an offensive foul. Again Towns seemed annoyed. The Moe Wagner Gambit was already showing signs of promise.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In The Game Behind The Game, his account of televising major sports events at ABC and at CBS, veteran TV sports producer Terry O’Neil writes about coming over to CBS and confronting a broadcasting culture that had pickled itself into a coma decades before. Apparently, the drinking culture at CBS Sports was even more widespread than that which O’Neil experienced working at ABC with Howard Cosell. This was plain even to the casual viewer at home, whose holiday viewing was spiced up annually by the Sun Bowl broadcast from El Paso during which Pat Summerall and Tom Brookshier regularly discussed how sockless they’d gotten themselves in Juarez the night before.
One of the non-alcoholic symptoms of stultification at CBS was the stubborn refusal to move its in-game cameras from their positions on the 50-yard line. ABC, as O’Neil points out, had long ago moved cameras to the 25-yard lines, as well as leaving one at the 50. This enabled ABC to show more football during its football telecasts which, for TV executives, was akin to perfecting nuclear fusion. But, as O’Neil remembers it, the issue almost came to guns and knives at CBS. People there actually made the argument that, at the 50, CBS had “the best seat in the house.” This sounded to O’Neil like they were bragging about cracking the technology of television three days before air.]]></summary>

Sure, you might be brutally dismembered, but at least you're going out on a high?

It is true that Jameis is a singular entity in the insurance company world of the National Football League, from the way he enters games to what he does during them and on the post-game podium afterwards. He has as much fun doing superoptimal things on a suboptimal team as any quarterback has since Bobby Layne quarterbacked the Detroit Lions and Pittsburgh Steelers while largely hung over throughout the 1950s. Plus, Layne didn't wear a facemask and still got to the Hall of Fame, and what's more fun than that?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the winter of 2015, David Lovelace, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Geology Museum, remembered a rock the size of a soccer ball that had been sitting on a shelf in his lab for months. He'd collected it the previous year, walking back to his car after a day of searching for fossils. It contained a small burrow, barely four inches long. He wanted to extract the burrow. "Being a good geologist, I hit the whole thing with my hammer," Lovelace said.
Unfortunately, the strike did not free the burrow, but it did reveal the skull of a small animal that had died inside. The tapered snout of the skull appeared crocodilian. But as Lovelace glued the bones back together and prepared the fossil, he realized it was actually an amphibian. Its skull had small pits and ridges characteristic of early amphibians, as well as grooves indicating a lateral line organ. Another strike of the rock revealed another skull and partial skeleton of the same kind of animal. Lovelace and his colleagues recently reported on this new species, a burrowing amphibian, Ninumbeehan dookoodukah, in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hate to say it, but the biggest laugh in James Acaster’s new special, Hecklers Welcome, comes from a heckle. Obviously. The show opens with the British comic naming his house rules, which amount to allowing all forms of audience disruption (except if it’s, you know, actually offensive). Anyone who knows Acaster—I know him from his very popular food podcast, Off Menu, which he co-hosts with fellow comedian Ed Gamble—knows he hates a heckle, so to build an entire show around it is kind of a big move. Being the pro writer that he is, the start of the show is a rundown of the various formative heckles of his career, the first of which arrived very early on during what he calls the worst gig he’s ever done. “Does your mother know you’re up this late?” was the trigger, to which a young Acaster apparently responded that his mother was dead (she wasn’t)—and that she had died really recently. Which silenced the heckler, obviously. As well as the rest of the audience, for the entire show.
Fast-forward about 30 minutes into this latest special, and the punchline to another Acaster joke is a guy yelling to a bunch of bullies that their parents don’t love them. To which one audience member pipes up: “My parents are dead!” Acaster is so impressed by the callback that he says: “Lovely to have a heckler in here who appreciates structure.” But then a few moments later, another audience member adds: “...by suicide.” Acaster asks his name (it’s Richard, because this is England). Then Acaster says, completely deadpan: “Richard, what is wrong with you, mate?”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the time of writing, on Dec. 2, 2024, Liverpool is nine points clear at the top of the Premier League table. The Pool Boys have been in torrid form domestically this season: 11 wins, one draw to second-place Arsenal, and one less-shocking-by-the-day loss to sixth-place Nottingham Forest. That run of 13 games includes wins over third-place Chelsea, fourth-place Brighton, and an always-pleasant thrashing of rival Manchester United. As of Sunday, it also includes a quite comfortable 2-0 victory over Manchester City, a club in full-blown crisis, insomuch as the Sky Blues can be in crisis; the loss to Liverpool threw City into fifth place, and the reigning champions have not won in seven matches across all competitions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The theory of the dribble handoff is sound: The hub, typically a center brutish enough to dislodge trailing defenders with a screen but adept enough with the rock to make quick passing decisions, scrambles typical pick-and-roll coverage by simultaneously acting as both ball-handler and screener. With a live dribble, they have the latitude to punish overzealous help defense and dictate the angle of the screen. The player coming around the DHO can either pop into open space or attack a slightly shifted defense, with the hub either rolling or popping themselves. 
One NBA team, Sacramento, has made the DHO the foundation of its half-court offense. This made total sense when the Kings implemented the system two seasons ago and won 48 games; it also helps explain why the team is currently drawing dead in a conference that has passed them by.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Justin Tucker sat encased in a sideline cape and hidden under a hood, alone with his thoughts and the millions of other people thinking them. He had just missed a 53-yard field goal that would have put the Baltimore Ravens ahead of the Philadelphia Eagles, and Tucker looked more than just morose. He looked even more than baffled. The most productive NFL kicker of the last decade looked like the living embodiment of a yip.
People speak of the yips often, usually in relation to a golfer with putting issues; for whatever it may be worth, the Oxford English Dictionary pegs the first use of the term as having been in 1935, in American Golfer. Everyone agrees on what it is: the sudden inability to perform a task one has performed many times before because the one performing the task is thinking too hard about the task itself and becoming overwhelmed by the very idea. It’s less that the task becomes more difficult and more that it just slips further and further out of perspective.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On Saturday, the San Jose State women's volleyball season came to an end, as the Spartans were beaten in four sets by the Colorado State Rams in the Mountain West Conference championship. A top seed comfortably prevailing over a second seed in a small conference tournament final is not a particularly remarkable or noteworthy outcome, but SJSU's tournament run gained national attention thanks to the hard work of people who hate sports almost as much as they hate transgender people.
Last week, ESPN's Katie Barnes published a long and deeply reported story about SJSU's volleyball season, which I highly recommend you read. The short version is that earlier this year an anti-trans activist group called Independent Council on Women's Sports (ICONS) and professional bigot Riley Gaines trained their sights on SJSU's volleyball team, claiming that the team has a transgender player. (The player in question has not been named in non-reactionary media coverage.) In March, ICONS and Gaines filed a lawsuit against the NCAA seeking to overturn the policies that allow transgender athletes to play sports. In September, SJSU co-captain Brooke Slusser joined the lawsuit, claiming that the presence of a transgender player on her team posed a safety risk to her teammates and opponents.]]></summary>
