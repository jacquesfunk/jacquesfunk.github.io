        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Los Angeles Dodgers hold a 2-0 lead in the World Series after Saturday night's 4-2 win over the New York Yankees, but the biggest concern right now is the state of Shohei Ohtani's labrum. The Dodgers superstar exited the game in the seventh inning after a stolen-base attempt partially dislocated his shoulder.
With two outs in the bottom of the seventh, Ohtani took off for second base and caught his arm awkwardly in the slide. After he was tagged out to end the inning, he stayed on the ground in pain while Dodgers staff attended to him. He then left the field holding his arm and didn't return. After Los Angeles escaped a dicey ninth inning to seal the win, manager Dave Roberts shared an update: Ohtani had suffered a left shoulder subluxation, and he would undergo further tests including an MRI on Sunday.]]></summary>

Yes, the series is well cast, and the production value is solid by contemporary standards, but you just cannot give away your best stuff in the pilot episode.
Fortunately, by the rules of our diminishing yet still shared reality, Game 1 was an extraordinary epic. Freddie Freeman pointing his bat toward the sky after hitting the first walk-off grand slam in World Series history—straight up, rather than in the direction of the game-winner he’d just vaporized—told everyone watching that whatever else happens in these next several days, a baseball event is coming from on high. On this night, and maybe for the next week, football could eat what we in the agricultural sciences call shit. Baseball is, for the moment, back.]]></summary>

This year we are gathering in Atlantic City, America's abandoned playground. We decided to hold a mini theme week to keep the site robust and full of blogs while we're in meetings. This year's theme: Risk!

It's not something I'm particularly proud of, but I will overthink every move I make, whether professional or personal, and either pass on anything that might go badly or wait until every other option has been eliminated. (One notable exception led to the website you're reading right now, but that's been talked about a lot at this point.) So when Justin asked me if I wanted to write something for Risk Week, I froze. We batted around a few ideas—if you wanted to read me writing about the 2009 Patriots-Colts 4th-and-2 game, sorry—but every idea I had was either boring or stretching the theme of "risk" to beyond its limit. Then I remembered, well, Risk.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s something cathartic about a room full of strangers singing the words, “You don’t know the shape I’m in.” It’s not that the crowd wasn’t singing along to most every other song MJ Lenderman played at Montreal’s Fairmount Theatre, but it’s those lyrics – “What else can you say to help/A friend with a broken heart/You don’t know the shape I’m in” – sung not long after a hurricane devastated Lenderman’s home state of North Carolina, that seemed to encompass the questionable shape we are all in. 
Lenderman, 25, is currently on tour with his five-piece backup band (MJ Lenderman And The Wind) to promote his fifth album, Manning Fireworks. I had meant to see this show in Toronto, but it sold out almost immediately. I guess fewer people know Lenderman in Montreal, even though there’s something about him that fits in better there. I saw him on the street a couple of hours before his set, while getting dinner with a friend – a tall guy with a small entourage, he is hard to miss, but he looked like any university student in the city, with his T-shirt and shaggy curls. “That’s him,” I told my friend, who wasn’t familiar with him or his music. I felt silly immediately—Lenderman is so unassuming in person that just pointing him out somehow felt intrusive.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In April, the Chicago Bears unveiled a nearly $5 billion proposal for a new stadium. According to the headline of the press release, this new property would be publicly owned. It was a polite way of describing an arrangement in which taxpayers would put more than $2 billion into the construction costs—two decades after they footed more than $400 million in the renovation bill for Soldier Field—and in return would get a vague $8 billion in "regional economic impact."
"An enclosed stadium is essential for Chicago to attract year-round events like the Super Bowl and major concerts—unlocking billions in tourism revenue," the release read. But is it?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Within the storied canon of lesbian period romances between the two different types of women—blonde and brunette, both white—Desert Hearts is my favorite of the genre. The premise is as sleek as its approximately 90-minute runtime. Vivian (Helen Shaver), a buttoned-up English professor at Columbia, moves to Reno, Nevada, also known as the divorce capital of the world, to stay the six weeks required to get a quick, no-fault divorce. Enter Cay (Patricia Charbonneau), a younger, free-spirited (read: lesbian) woman, who pursues Vivian about as openly as a queer woman could in 1959. Tumbleweeds roll, nipples touch, and soon Vivian's world unravels.
Vivian first encounters Cay on the road to Reno, in the passenger seat of a car driven by a woman named Frances, who owns the all-inclusive divorce ranch where Vivian intends to spend the next six weeks reading and writing presumably stodgy literature. After Frances and Vivian's sensible car passes Cay, who is driving a glimmering convertible in the opposite direction, Cay reverses the convertible to say "hi" and start laying it on thick: "Can I call you professor?" she teases, dark hair whipping in the wind. When an oncoming car emerges behind her, Cay waits until the absolute last second to shift her car into drive and avoid a crash.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Samsung Intensity was released in September 2009, when I was 13. I try to avoid dating myself too specifically when writing, but it feels important here to delineate the contours of a memory via time and place. The Intensity was a slide phone, with a full QWERTY keyboard on the inside panel. You could take pictures, but not videos. You could send texts and emails, the latter a function I never used because I could never figure it out and I didn’t have anyone to email anyway. My Intensity came in the most popular color, flamingo red, and I often feel that this particular phone in this particular color not only signifies the design and fashion of the era but also the anxieties of suburban kids, like me, who did not know what technology meant to them. 
By 2009, three generations of the iPhone had already cemented a new kind of envy amongst the most status-obsessed people—namely, teenagers. Touchscreens on mobile devices represented if not wealth then access. I remember feeling that to be faced with the prospect of using a glorified flip phone released the same year as the iPhone 3GS, which reoriented the word “sleek” in the global lexicon, was a kind of cosmic slap in the face. The common reassurance that Apple’s cutting-edge technology would soon be democratized, that everyone would eventually be able to afford something like an iPhone, was hollow comfort. The point, for me, wasn’t about some hazy day in the future when I too could have it. I wanted to be one of the first.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The official box score only credits Victor Wembanyama with four turnovers in San Antonio's 109-120 Thursday night loss to the hosting Dallas Mavericks. I suppose it's not a turnover when a rebound slips right through your fingers, or else I am confident that number would have zeroes after it. Wembanyama is one of the most gifted and extraordinary athletes alive; he can do just about everything; and against the Mavs his hands seemed to belong to someone else entirely. Possibly Pazuzu.
You can't revolutionize the sport every night. Up to 81 times in this regular season, Wembanyama will warp the game in amazing, breathtaking ways; he will do things nobody his size has ever done before, and which shame the agility and coordination of world-class athletes a foot shorter. Thursday night, it was as if he'd accidentally left one of his spatial dimensions—depth, assuredly—in the locker room. The Mavericks would miss a shot, and the rebound would be there and Wembanyama would be there to get it, and the ball would pass through (what should have been) his grip as though he was a green-screen artifact. A Spurs teammate would throw a lob in his direction, and he would leap and stretch out those incredible arms ... and interact with the ball in the manner of a slight breeze, scarcely even altering its trajectory.]]></summary>

My first car was a Jeep. Two-door Cherokee. Black. It had a working tape deck and an eager gas pedal, which was all I required. I drove that car to college and back a hundred times. I drove it to work. I drove it to my best friend’s house. I drove it to Boston. I drove it to New York City. I drove it to see girls. I drove it to parties, houses, stadiums, and ski resorts. I almost always drove alone, and preferred it that way. If I had a trip coming up and I knew it would be just me and my car, I was content.

Seeing some dolphins horsing around more or less cancels out a hotel-wide internet outage that postponed the recording of this episode; some of the most critically dire bar vibes I have ever encountered at 10 p.m. anywhere in the world are counteracted by seeing a security guard happily dancing to Kool & The Gang's "She's Fresh" on the casino floor the next morning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I couldn’t even go a week without Turki Alalshikh, the chairman of Saudi Arabia’s General Entertainment Authority, popping up on my laptop during a live sporting event. On Oct. 12, he was in the front row for the undisputed light heavyweight championship fight between Artur Beterbiev and Dmitry Bivol, a long-awaited bout he was instrumental in putting together. (He was the third-most important character of the night, getting name-checked by the ring announcer and both fighters and promptly calling for a rematch when he disagreed with the judges’ scorecards.) Not seven days later, there Alalshikh was on the glowing rectangle again, front and center at the Six Kings Slam—an exhibition he spearheaded that featured five of the best and most famous male tennis players on the planet, and also Hogler Rune. 
Alalshikh’s place within a murderous, deeply discriminatory regime has not dissuaded boxing from working in lockstep with him, catching the money he throws in order to stage high-demand fights that would not have happened without the unlimited wealth at his disposal. But there was nothing high-demand about the Six Kings Slam. It was an exhibition event whose headlining match-ups, like Carlos Alcaraz-Jannik Sinner, were ongoing rivalries that have grown without intervention from Alalshikh or anybody else. This event happened simply because it could, and because Saudi Arabia’s sportswashing efforts are now so ubiquitous, it felt immunized from any loud complaints.]]></summary>

The model has told a clear story for the last few weeks: This election is a tossup. The current state of play poses a clear problem, however. If the election is a tossup, and the model can't offer any insight other than to forecast the race with a 50-50 chance to break in either direction, then how do I get people to pay attention to me?]]></summary>

This year we are gathering in Atlantic City, America's abandoned playground. We decided to hold a mini theme week to keep the site robust and full of blogs while we're in meetings. This year's theme: Risk!
I never would have seen the paintings that probably changed the trajectory of my life if it hadn’t been for a ridiculous, almost unbelievable, amount of luck. In the Fall of 2007, I went to a Dallas Stars hockey game. It was early in the season. My hair was still stained pink from a Manic Panic decision you can only make at 16, and when we walked in the arena an older woman made eye contact with me. They were handing out the kind of gimmicky give-away that is mainly an advertisement: novelty airplane tickets. I would probably have misplaced mine but the woman was so focused and insisted that I keep track of it, that this ticket would be important. And it was. At some point in the game, I won: my ticket flashed on the screen, and was magically transformed from a piece of shiny garbage into two free tickets to anywhere American Airlines flew in the world.]]></summary>
