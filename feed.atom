        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Craig Calcaterra, writing at Cup of Coffee:
To say this is a massive loss is about as big an understatement as
is possible. Henderson was the biggest and brightest star of his
generation. There may not have been any player in history who was
better at more things than Rickey Henderson was.
Henderson was, without question, the greatest leadoff hitter of
all time and the greatest base-stealer of all time. He, arguably,
possessed the greatest combination of power and speed of any
player in the history of the game as well. Perhaps the best
characterization of Henderson’s career came from Bill James who
once wrote that, “if you could split Rickey Henderson in two,

        <updated>2024-12-21T18:45:17.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I switched from a Samsung to a Pixel, I was shocked to discover that the 'double-tap to lock' feature (where you double-tap an empty area of the home screen to lock your device) wasn't a native option.
This feature existed as far back as 2014 on my LG G3, so why is it missing on the Pixel?
While there are alternatives on the Play Store, most are either closed-source or bundled into custom launchers — neither of which I wanted. Sending the lock-screen signal requires the Accessibility Service, and I wasn’t comfortable granting that level of access to a closed-source third-party app.
So, I decided to create my own solution. My app is completely open-source, contains no tracking or analytics libraries, and doesn’t make any external requests. The Accessibility Service permission is used solely to send the lock-screen command. I tried to find an alternative to locking the screen without requiring Accessibility permissions but the options either required root or weren't what I needed.
I also saw this as a chance to explore modern Android development. The last time I built an app from scratch, Jetpack Compose didn’t even exist. While I didn’t hate the experience, I won’t say I miss the days of wrestling with XML either. That said, some aspects of Compose felt harder to fully grasp and work with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspecting large, deeply-nested JSON files in a text editor can be particularly cumbersome and not very effective. This Linux terminal tool provides an alternative by reflecting the tree structure of the input data in the interface itself, which consists of a hierarchical multi-column browser.
The inspiration for this is the "Miller column" technique used in applications such as macOS Finder or the ranger file browser.
I hope you find it useful, especially for tasks like inspecting large structured logs.

Why I Built It
I’m someone who geeks out over nutrition and saving money, but every time I tried to manually plan meals, I’d miss out on store discounts or forget to track certain macros. So I created PennyMeal to automate all that, and it’s grown into a pretty comprehensive tool.

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42479689</id>
        <link href="https://revmax.pro/"/>
        <updated>2024-12-21T13:56:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN,
As a Marketing Lead at a dev tool company for over 2 years, I often struggled to generate quality leads. Traditional tools like 6sense, Demandbase, ZoomInfo, and RB2B didn’t quite work for us. They relied heavily on static databases or generic intent signals that didn’t resonate with our audience—developers.
After trying pretty much everything, I stumbled upon a new approach: leveraging GitHub activity as a source of intent signals. By identifying developers who starred, forked, raised issues, or discussions on relevant open-source repositories, I could pinpoint high-intent leads with a level of precision traditional tools just couldn’t match.
That experiment turned out to be a game-changer. Now, I’ve built a platform to make this process seamless and accessible to others. The tool automates the sourcing of developer engagement signals from GitHub (open-source repos only) and delivers actionable insights, like LinkedIn profiles, directly to Slack, email, or a dashboard.
Key Highlights:
  -- It’s live: There’s a free plan available for anyone to try.
  -- Developer-first: Helps dev tool companies focus on developers actively engaging with their repos or competitors’ code, rather than chasing generic leads.

  -- Ethical use: Data is sourced from public, open-source repositories via GitHub’s API. We’re continuously reviewing guidelines to ensure compliance.

-- How do you view the ethics of using public developer activity for lead generation?
-- What other platforms or signals would you like to see integrated?
We’re just getting started and would love your thoughts. Check it out here: https://revmax.pro. You can reach out to me directly at dhaval@revmax.pro

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42479473</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/supercorp-ai/supergateway"/>
        <updated>2024-12-21T13:17:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
I’ve just released Supergateway and it allows to use MCP servers with stdio on remote assistants over SSE.
Now most of MCP servers only support stdio transport and this is problematic if you want remote assistants to access them. MCP spec has SSE transport which works with remote HTTP connections but it is rarely used by MCP server authors. So I’ve created this gateway that allows you to run stdio transport MCP servers and tunnel them via SSE transport.
It’s very simple to use. Run any stdio MCP server like this:
npx -y supergateway --stdio "uvx mcp-server-git"
It’s totally open-source and supports pretty much any MCP server.
Built this since we have an AI infrastructure platform (https://superinterface.ai) that allows you to use MCP servers in remote assistants and we saw that we cannot really run any community MCP servers without something like this.
It’s def pretty cool to see remote assistants embedded on a website being able to access these cool MCP servers.
Let me know what you think!

I built a new and modern PDF Editor. I had been using some online PDF Editors since years and over the period of time I found that most of them were either slow and outdated or bloated with un-necessary features. Another pain point was all of the PDF editors mentioned "Free" but right after you do edits and want to export anything, they ask you to pay. I decided to fix my own itch and built PDF Editify.
Using PDF Editify, users can fill, sign, edit, redact, annotate PDFs and much more. The free version allows users to export 3 PDFs with unlimited edits per week. We are constantly working on new features, some of which are:
- Digital Signatures (currently we only support Electronic Signatures) 
- PDF Templates Catalog 
- OCR PDFs
This is my first product and we have good feedback from our users. I would love any questions, comments or feedback from the HN community and any ideas for marketing would be appreciated since I (being a tech guy) really find marketing boring.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN! I built a fun little website that generates "Pseudo-Chinese (偽中国語)" using an LLM. It takes your input and transforms it into a sentence composed only of Kanji or Chinese characters, but structured with Japanese grammar. This makes it surprisingly readable to both Japanese and Chinese speakers who can leverage their knowledge of shared characters.
The inspiration for this project came from another popular Japanese app called "対多." Its developer mentioned struggling to achieve satisfactory "Pseudo-Chinese" generation using ChatGPT. This piqued my curiosity, and I decided to tackle the challenge myself.
I'd love for you to give it a try and let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN!
I’ve built a Chrome extension called "ChatGPT to Word or PDF' that makes saving ChatGPT conversations super simple.
With a single click, you can export your ChatGPT responses as a Word or PDF file.
Why I Built This:
I found it frustrating to copy-paste ChatGPT conversations into external tools to save or share them. This tool eliminates that hassle by integrating directly into your browser, letting you download files instantly.
Use Cases:
- Documenting Ideas: Save brainstorming sessions with ChatGPT for future reference.
- Client Deliverables: Share neatly formatted responses as Word or PDF files.
- Study Notes: Keep records of educational prompts and ChatGPT-generated answers.
- Team Collaboration: Easily share ChatGPT output with teammates in a professional format.
Key Features:
- One-click export of ChatGPT responses.
- Automatically downloads files in your chosen format (Word or PDF).
- Simple interface – no extra configurations needed.
Link:
Check it out here: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-to-word-or-...
I’d love your feedback! What do you think about this? What features or improvements would make this tool more useful for you?

        <link href="https://shortcards.app/"/>
        <updated>2024-12-21T09:49:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many people (including my close family) are not aware of the various useful screenshots macOS and its apps provide. 
Often they are very surprised when I show them handy shortcuts like the one for deleting an entire line, or the one that starts a screen recording.
You can, of course, look up keyboard shortcuts in the menus and there are lots of shortcut cheat sheets on the internet. But I found none of them really appealing to nontechnical people.
So, last year, I designed my own shortcut cheat sheet. But instead of putting it all on a full-size letter sheet, I had the idea to print mini cheat sheets for various apps and topics in the size of business cards. That way, you can easily have one or two cards on your desk for the shortcuts you really need. I had these printed on cardboard paper and started giving them away to friends and family.
I think knowing your shortcuts really makes your life easier. Everybody should have their set of cheat sheet cards on their desk! But, of course, I can’t send a deck of cards to everybody.
As an app developer, I thought: What better way is there for us than creating an app with the shortcut cards?
The result is “Shortcards”, which is both a website and an app. You can simply look up and learn shortcuts on https://shortcards.app
And with the free native app, you get a handy reference directly on your Mac or iPhone. In the app, you can quickly search for shortcuts, conveniently filter by topic, and mark your most-used or high-priority cards as favorites for instant access.
It includes shortcuts for basic macOS system commands, Finder navigation, and text editing.

I am super excited to share Director, an open-source agentic framework we’ve been working on that comes with pre-built video agents for tasks like spoken and vision search, editing, summarization, dubbing, video generation, and many more. For video tasks, it utilizes VideoDB’s “video-as-data” infrastructure, so you get instant streams.
A hosted version is available at https://chat.videodb.io. Feedback is appreciated, and PRs are always welcome
I’m really looking forward to seeing what agents you build and the use cases this unlocks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[*Please try and read this if you're a developer, if you're not you can still try that out!!*
As a developer, I work within a team to build software. However, when I wanted to share a piece of code with my team members or ask for any suggestions on any business logic, classes, or functions, I needed to copy the code and send it via Microsoft Teams and Slack. I was thinking what if I could share that piece of code using my code editor that doesn't need to switch between screens which is clunky and time-consuming?
That was the actual pain point and motivation to build Turbogist, which lets you share codes in real time with others. Right now I only created the extension for VS Code and am working on building a plugin for JetBrains as well. First thing first, I want to validate the idea.
However, I have some plans to add some additional features that will integrate a seamless snippet and code sharing by integrating GitHub Gists or Pastebin-like services. You can try out the extension and see the tool in action by visiting the landing page and joining the beta.
Looking for your input on:
- How this would fit your workflow?
- Must-have features or integrations (e.g., GitHub Gist, PasteBin, etc.)?
- Pain points in your current code-sharing process?
Thank you for checking this out, looking forward to your feedback!

 Encountering a big, beautiful espresso machine at someone’s house feels a lot like gazing upon the countertop equivalent of a vintage Bentley, or observing the mechanics of an expensive watch. There’s that covetable air of functional sophistication; the nonchalant cool that comes with a device that showers you with at-home cappuccinos at the pull of a handle (or push of a button, these days). Granted, these sexy Rube Goldberg machines are not cheap — so when a sale on a top-shelf brand pops up, I pay attention. 
Right now, De’Longhi has kicked off a holiday sale that will last until December 24, and which chips away at its (otherwise) lofty price tags with up to $300 off its espresso and coffee machines. Below, I plucked three of the best, most affordable De’Longhi deals from the sale, whether you’re looking for a smaller countertop option or a cold brew-making beast.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tads Basic Game Objects, tabageos, is a JavaScript library for making games and applications. I've been working on it for the past 12 years in my spare time. Originally it was an AS3 library for Flex game making, starting in 2012 I ported it to JavaScript. 
One method many may find useful even outside of a game setting is the tabageos.loadSpriteSheetAndStart method. With a little setup you can effectively keep an image from showing up in dev tools using that method. I use it to generally secure sprite sheets for games. One major game released with the library so far is called Idle City Sim 2051. The github has complete games that are open source and there are examples of using each class individually.

        <updated>2024-12-20T23:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Tuas, on the westernmost edge of Singapore, a lamp post has become an unexpected monument, a source of joy for cyclists, and a rare exception in a country with strict laws against vandalism.

The story of what makes this lamp post special started in 2014, when a group of cyclists pasted a sticker reading "Pedal Until Shiok" on the post, marking the end of a 50-kilometer bike ride. (Shiok is a Singaporean and Malaysian word used to convey excitement and happiness.) According to Singapore's Vandalism Act of 1966, pasting that sticker was an illegal act. It was soon removed by authorities.

A while later, other cyclists started flocking to the lamp post to take pictures and paste their own stickers. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and then during the so-called "circuit breaker" period from April to June, cycling gained popularity among many Singaporeans, and even more people were leaving their mark on Tuas Lamp Post 1.

Although most citizens know of Singapore’s vandalism laws, cyclists expressed their unhappiness when the stickers were removed from the lamp post. The government took notice of their concerns, and in January 2021, Singapore's transport minister Ong Ye Kung announced that the stickers could stay. Kung acknowledged the unique appeal of the lamp post, and its importance to local cyclists. He expressed, "These are little exceptions to the rule, which do not cause disamenities or pose safety hazards to the public, to brighten up life in Singapore."]]></summary>

A small group of indie devs (including me) put together a simple browser that shows a bunch of of the hits and "hidden gems" (games with high player ratings but few players) off in an easy-to-skim interface.
Simple stuff, website-wise, but we're hoping it helps surface stuff that folks wouldn't ordinarily find. It's free, it covers a bunch of different categories, and it works on desktop and mobile.
Would love to hear what HN thinks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jim Harbaugh has this look about him that screams dotty uncle—the blinky eyes behind the old-man glasses, the slightly slack jaw, the refusal to employ the newfangled play-sheet-and-face-shield look. He's perfectly cast for a man who thinks Lawrence Welk is the cutting edge.
Thus, it was right and proper that he be the one to return the fair catch kick to our notice by stealing a last-second three-banger right before halftime of last night's Amazonapalooza in which Harbaugh's Los Angeles Chargers defeated the almost as old but not nearly so physically arresting Sean Payton and the Denver Broncos. An arcane enclave of the rulebook which was successfully employed as recently as 1976, when Harbaugh was spiritually already in his mid-40s, the fair catch kick can be employed only on a fair catch as time expires, or a penalty on a fair catch, which the Broncos' Tremon Smith gifted the Chargers on a punt that Derius Davis tried to collect with no time left on the clock. The 15-yard penalty took the ball from the Charger 38 to the Bronco 47 and offered an untimed play to provide the punishment for the penalty that would otherwise go unpunished—why, you could hear the oldey-timey gears in a million old coaches' heads at the possibilities. “It’s my favorite rule in football,” Harbaugh said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a founder of simplyblock.io, where we’re building K8s-native storage backend for NVMe. Our tech is mostly aimed to support stateful workloads on Kubernetes. We’re seeing that scalable persistent storage is one of the reasons why people are scared to run state on Kubernetes.
Anyhow, we talked to people and asked them about the number and sizes of their EBS volumes in EKS, and very few could answer. When asking about their actual usage, in terms of capacity throughput and IOPS, people usually don’t know where to find them. From the ones that checked it, the utilization rate is normally at 20-30%, which is crazy low. That’s mostly because lots of storage is overprovisioned on the database level.
That’s why we built a small tool to collect the data right in Kubernetes itself. The tool can be deployed into your EKS cluster via a helm chart. It only needs read access permissions. It exports all found EBS volumes to a CSV with their respective usage and performance information.
We also built a small calculator to provide a fast way to get insight from the CSV. The calculator is a pure in-browser tool and does not upload information to our servers. While we mostly built it for our prospects and customers, we believe it’s a valuable tool for the broader Kubernetes community, and we already think about how to expand the enabled environments and clouds.
Hope you enjoy it and find it useful! Feedback is appreciated.

I adapted Machiavelli The Prince to the Silicon Valley context, using Sonnet. It took a 6-hour+ non-strop spree to write a 81 pages, and it's kind of an instructive read!
Rather than making any line edits, I was able to share high level feedback over the first few chapters and keep regenerating. This process was awesome - I could be extremely ruthlessly critical for hours on end and it didn't hurt Claude's feelings, they just improved, until it was effectively "trained". We're all used to that with objective contexs like coding, but in a subjective context it was a different and really good feeling, like working with an incredibly mature friend in your band.
Because philosophical texts are short, you can write adaptations that maintain your feedback to the end, making it easier and easier to generate later chapters with no intervention.
One of the better collaborative experiences I've had! Once we have agents ready, should kind of just adapt all classic philosophical texts to allegories about DHH, AMD, and uh, Quibi.
Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN,
aviation enthusiast often use Flightradar24 and other systems to find out what flights are directly above their location at any time. Inspired by a few other projects, I built a basic HTML + Javascript dashboard, that does the same, simulating an old school LED display.
Enjoy the Github repo!
How it works:
Standard HTML page that loads the flightradar data in a specific location box that you specify. Because the free flightradar24 data is browser only, I used a corsproxy to get around loading issues. Everything works with the free versions, but if you hit limits, you can also specify a key to a paid CORS Proxy service.
Once the data is loaded, JS refreshes it every 30 seconds. The HTML itself is refreshed once an hour, so even a dashboard you don't have access to would be updated from new changes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Babygirl, a movie written and directed by Dutch filmmaker Halina Reijn and starring Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson, is about facades. It's also about sex, but less about sex itself and more about what sex says about a person, and the ways we suppress our sexual appetites in order for it to say nothing about us at all. Babygirl, Reijn's second English-language film after 2022's Bodies Bodies Bodies, taps into a conservative cultural moment that is firmly anti-sex while still being in sex's thrall. It is the subject everyone wants to talk about but no one wants to see, or seemingly even have.
The movie follows tech CEO Romy Mathis (Kidman), an unabashed, all-caps GIRLBOSS who nominally "has it all": a powerful job, a big office, an eager assistant who looks up to her, a seemingly well-adjusted family that includes two daughters and a hot theater director for a husband (Antonio Banderas). But there is a restless beast inside of Romy, and vanilla sex with her husband can't appease it—so much so that Romy often finds herself having to watch dom-play porn in the bathroom afterwards in order to actually reach an orgasm. When a much younger intern for the company arrives, Samuel (Dickinson), she slowly finds herself ensnared in his web, and discovers that he is up for taming that beast. Both in spite and because of the power dynamics and the threat their affair poses to her life and career, they begin an ill-advised relationship that is hot and steamy, but most importantly effective and passionate. Romy finds her sexual needs met for the first time, which, in this movie, is as important as the tension or thriller aspects at play.]]></summary>

Over time, the goal is to make more data sources available to connect and empower users to learn from their personal data stored across these platforms. Think data about the food we eat, places we travel, or shows we watch.
Data accessibility and cleanliness is the hardest part, but I'm always open to different sources and visualization types.
Let me know what you think and if there are certain data sets you'd like to see visualized!

Starbucks Workers United says the company isn’t bargaining in good faith. So they’re rolling out strikes around the country just in time for the holidays.
 In 2024, Starbucks Workers United (SBWU) grew across the U.S.: In October, the 500th Starbucks location unionized, and now there are over 525 stores in 45 states who have voted to unionize. And in February, Starbucks finally agreed to bargain with the union, but negotiations have stalled — SBWU has accused the company of failing to present a viable economic proposal, despite the company’s insistence that they settle the contract by the end of the year. In response, the union is going on an unfair labor practice strike across the country.

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42472219</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/JasperSui/fastapi-injectable"/>
        <updated>2024-12-20T16:01:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN!
I created fastapi-injectable to solve a common pain point in FastAPI: using Depends() outside of route handlers.
This has been a long-standing issue in the FastAPI community with a discussion post around it.
Install with: pip install fastapi-injectable
The package lets you use FastAPI's dependency injection in:
- CLI tools
- Background workers
- Test fixtures
- Any non-HTTP context
Basic example:
    from typing import Annotated

    from fastapi import Depends
    from fastapi_injectable import injectable

    class Database:
        def query(self) -> str:
            return "data"

    def get_db() -> Database:
        return Database()

    @injectable
    def process_data(db: Annotated[Database, Depends(get_db)]) -> str:
        return db.query()

    # Use it anywhere!
    result = process_data()
    print(result) # Output: 'data'


The common suggestion for handling dependencies outside FastAPI routes is to use separate DI frameworks like dependency-injector. However, this means:
1. Managing two different DI systems in your codebase
2. Learning another framework's patterns
3. Potentially duplicating dependency logic
Currently, there's no package that extends FastAPI's native Depends() beyond routes.
fastapi-injectable solves this by providing a clean API that lets you use FastAPI's dependency injection anywhere.
Links:
GitHub: https://github.com/your-username/fastapi-injectable
Docs: https://fastapi-injectable.readthedocs.io
PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/fastapi-injectable
I'd love to hear your feedback and contributions to make this package better! Feel free to open issues or PRs if you have ideas for improvements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thonsepar, aka St. Mary's Islands, aka Coconut Island, sits in the Arabian Sea just off the coast of Karnataka state of India. The island is known for its distinctive geological formations, specifically the columnar joints (hexagon-shaped interlocking columns) that protrude from the earth.

The columnar joints vary in height, but the tallest of them measures approximately six meters (20 feet). According to geologists, the columns formed by subvolcanic activity roughly 60 million years ago as Madagascar split off from India.

The shape of these joints is the product of a physical process that can happen as melted lava rock solidifies. As a large amount of molten material cools, it starts to contract, creating cracks in the newly solid surface. The cracks extend down as the rock below the surface continues to cool, resulting in these unique rock formations. You can see similar formations at the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland.

Thonsepar was classified as a National Geological Monument in 2001 by the Geological Survey of India.]]></summary>

From classic chocolate chip cookies to ube crinkles and holiday party-worthy linzers, these are the cookie recipes we make again and again
 Cookie season is here, when it’s no longer too hot to turn on the oven, and when we’re practicing our best bakes in hopes of impressing at all the holiday cookie parties to come. The cookie can be humble, like the simple sugar cookies plus mix-ins that we make when we have leftover candy laying around, or snickerdoodles and their many variations. Or cookies can be a whole ordeal, like project-worthy linzer cookies that call for some helping hands. Whatever your cookie preferences, these are the recipes that Eater editors turn to time and time again, because life is always better with a fresh batch of cookies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, I'm tired of making decisions from big to small, even though I can.
The simplest tool would be a Yes/No decision bot that generates random yes/no answers (there are a ton of them online). We know they aren't very useful, but they actually do give you a final decision.
On the other hand, modern AI tools are great with knowledge retrieval but often leave you with more information but still no clear answer.
Hence, I built a Solaris, a messaging-based AI assistant that helps users make yes/no decisions through guided conversations. Instead of giving direct answers, it asks thoughtful questions to help users reach their own conclusions, culminating in a final decision.
It is designed to be a thinking partner - it helps users explore their own decision-making process while maintaining full responsibility for their choices.
Try it: https://t.me/diametricbot
I'd love feedback from the HN community on this (somewhat socratic) approach and potential improvements!

        <link href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42472053"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN,
I’m a solo founder, and I’ve been working on an AI tool that helps companies and organizations navigate and comply with EU regulations. The platform leverages AI to provide insights, research capabilities, and compliance assistance, aiming to reduce the complexity and time spent dealing with regulatory requirements.
Compliance with EU regulations (like GDPR, labor laws, and industry-specific rules) can be overwhelming, especially for SMEs and startups. As someone passionate about tech and legal simplification, I saw an opportunity to create a tool that streamlines this process, providing actionable guidance while cutting down costs.
What the tool does:
- Uses AI to answer EU regulatory questions.
- Provides links to legislation articles, so that users can dig deeper when needed.
- The tool condenses complex legislation into clear summaries, drastically reducing the time needed to understand key topics.
As the only person behind this project, I wear multiple hats—coding, marketing, business development, and more. I’ve learned a lot, but I know there’s so much more to improve, particularly in product-market fit, user onboarding, and getting the word out.
I'd love to hear from the HN community on a few topics in particular:
- Product feedback: Does this solve a real problem for you or someone you know?
- Marketing advice: What are the best ways to promote a niche AI tool like this?
- Solo founder tips: For those who’ve been here, what’s your advice on staying productive and scaling effectively?
I’d love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or even criticisms. Also, if you’ve had experience dealing with EU regulations, does this tool sound useful? What features would you want to see?
Here’s the link to the tool: https://eur-lex.ai/
Thank you, and I’m looking forward to hearing your feedback!

 This was a delightfully chaotic year for food on film, whether on the small or the big screen. As a refresher, this year saw the return of Chef’s Table and the debut of the much-maligned Jerry Seinfeld Pop-Tart movie. There was a chicken haunting the satirical characters of The Curse, and Kristen Kish stepped into Padma’s shoes as the new host of ol’ workhorse Top Chef. Reba McIntyre’s latest sitcom, Happy’s Place, is set in a bar; the Food Network’s latest baking competition is inexplicably set in Hogwarts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an industry-wide first, the National Labor Relations Board argued last week that contestants participating in Netflix’s hit reality TV dating show Love Is Blind should be classified as employees. If implemented into policy—which, admittedly, seems unlikely given the fact that Donald Trump is expected to fire the current NLRB general legal counsel—the filing could not only give more on-set protection to participants of shows like Love Is Blind but potentially allow them to unionize. 
Since its oddly prescient premiere in February 2020, which saw 15 men and 15 women dating, falling in love and eventually getting engaged sight unseen, Love Is Blind has faced allegations of mistreatment and coercion. Early contestants have accused producers of plying them with alcohol while regularly denying them food and water; one contestant alleged that production pushed her to continue filming even after she told them that she was experiencing suicidal ideation and wanted to leave. Over the past four years and seven seasons, the two production companies behind Love Is Blind—Kinetic Content and Delirium TV—have faced multiple lawsuits from former contestants. One of them alleges “inhumane working conditions” while another accuses Kinetic and Delirium of negligence, false imprisonment and sexual assault.]]></summary>

I have been using the tool, which I called Artemis, for several months. Every morning, I looked forward to my "morning paper" of blogs I love reading.
There are no notifications, read vs. unread states, counts of posts, etc. Only the last seven days of posts are available. The colour scheme is changeable. Dark mode is supported. All popular feed formats are supported.
There is no reading interface to read blog posts; rather, the links take you to the authors' websites. Many of my favourite bloggers put a lot of effort into the design of their blogs and like to change things up; I wanted an experience that embraced that.
The reader is now available for anyone to use (with invite code "hn").

We tested three popular French toast recipes to find the one we could easily whip up for a crowd
 Maybe it’s just me, but pancakes feel like an any-weekend food, while French toast feels more special occasion. Perhaps it’s the fact that I grew up with the assumption that French toast required planning and couldn’t be made on a whim: Not only did the bread need a while to soak, it also had to be stale before soaking. For this reason, I don’t make French toast too often.
But with visions of holiday mornings in my head — twinkly warm lights, the smell of cinnamon wafting from somewhere — it seemed high time to revisit French toast and to test whether my assumption was actually justified. Does French toast have to be a pre-planned af…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brussels, the capital of Belgium, is home to many museums, including one dedicated to a fascinating pair of subjects: mythology and sexuality.

Founded in March 2012 by Dr. Guy Martens, the Museum of Erotics and Mythology (or MEM for short) is a unique, lesser-known gem. It is housed in a charming 18th-century building in the Sablon district and showcases the founder's private collection of diverse antiquities and erotic art through the ages.

For thousands of years, sexuality and eroticism have been recurring themes of art, whether humorous or arousing. The collection that Martens has amassed includes a vast array of genitalia, lovemaking, and bodily aesthetics in every medium and material. Once you enter, you will be surrounded by phallic shapes and yonic images, while statuettes perform Kama Sutra positions in ivory, bronze, and wood, as Greek gods and Aztec warriors and Japanese courtesans.

The museum also boasts an original bronze sculpture by Salvador Dalí and regularly holds temporary exhibits focused on different aspects of erotic art. If you have any ounce of interest in sexual ethnography, don't be shy and pay this gem a visit.]]></summary>

Thanks to the so-called Slavic Diet trend, buckwheat is the latest cultural food staple to be cast as a TikTok fetish object
 Two things in life are inevitable: the march of time, and FoodTok gentrifying any given culture’s dietary staples.
The latest traditional food to fall victim to TikTok’s machinations is buckwheat, a wholesome grain (well, technically a seed) that proponents of the “Slavic Diet” trend are touting for its health benefits, pairing it with decidedly non-traditional, non-Slavic foods like avocado — another humble staple given a bougie makeover.

 The premise of this column is to teach you how to make a delicious single-serving dinner. Consider these tender, herby chicken meatballs a great exception.
The beauty of these meatballs, which are cooked in a dead-simple tomato sauce, is that they can be repurposed into a few different meals.
I like to serve some over polenta the night of and then use them later in the week in a variety of ways: tossed in pasta, sliced on a sub-style sandwich with melted mozzarella, even served for breakfast over rice with a fried egg.

Eggnog is easy to make at home, and worlds better than the store-bought stuff
 Most of us have a family recipe or two (or maybe a whole file of them) that we break out during the holiday season. For some people it’s cookies, for others it’s that perfect side dish that rounds out a holiday dinner. For me, it’s making eggnog from scratch. 
Making eggnog at home is easier than it sounds. It also allows you to control the ingredients, which means you can personalize the flavor, adjusting sweetness, spiciness, and of course, alcohol levels all to your taste. You’ll also avoid preservatives and artificial flavors. Homemade eggnog is so far away from most store-bought versions that they’re barely the same drink.

Workers United says the walkouts will start in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Seattle, with strike action set to spread each day and reach hundreds of stores by Christmas Eve unless a deal is reached.

Trying to buy cool, non-corny jewelry for someone you love this holiday season? There are actually many unique options out there for folks shopping on a budget, and they’re an easy upgrade from the yawn-inducing calligraphy heart mall pendant. There has been an influx of food-inspired apparel and accessories over the past few years, from Loewe’s celery bag to the cookie-emblazoned purse from NY-based brand Puppets and Puppets. And luckily, the latter has given us a fresh out of the oven take on the classic Claddagh ring, otherwise known as a ye old Celtic symbol for love. In lieu of a heart, the brand’s gold-plated ring clutches a cookie with black rhinestone chocolate chips, making it the perfect piece of everyday jewelry for the passionate home baker (or, quite simply, lover of sweets) in your life. Sláinte!



No peeking! But check out what the Eater Advent Calendar has already revealed.  And check back each day for a new clutch condiment, gadget, or nibble that, yes, makes an amazing gift — but these surprises are just for you.]]></summary>

assessing competing conceptions of civic education for our polarized times: the
“patriotic education” proposed by the 1776 Commission Report versus the
“reflective patriotism” supported by the Educating for American Democracy Roadmap.

By the time the restaurant opens its doors three hours later, the line stretches for several city blocks and the nearby 200-foot obelisk — an icon of the Argentine capital’s cityscape — gleams in the fast-warming sun.

Cattle need to be herded, fences checked, and horses fed, even when the snow swirls around your boots and the temperatures are so cold they frost your eyelashes. There’s a special magic about that time of year—something enchanting about the stark contrast between the white snow and the dark slash of a steam-powered train, between the pale blue sky and the dark shapes of cows huddled contentedly amid the drifting snow. If you want a real taste of the Old West, there’s no better time to make your pilgrimage than winter.

        <updated>2024-12-20T13:54:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN!
I’m excited to share flybnb.io, a side project I built out of personal frustration while traveling full-time with my wife. We often searched for flights and Airbnb stays separately, only to realize that one was way out of budget after planning the other. I wanted a way to combine both searches and instantly see the total trip cost, so I built it myself.
What flybnb.io can do:
- Gets flights from SkyScanner and Airbnb prices in one go with total costs for each condition (ex: fast flight + cheap stay)
- Smart Filters: Set minimum review counts and scores for stays to filter out unreliable listings that skew pricing.
- Auto-categorize Airbnb listings into three price tiers (Economy, Standard, and Premium) for easy research/planning.
- Generates links to directly search/book exact itinerary or listing on SkyScanner and Airbnb. (Note that sometimes SkyScanner results might differ in price from what is shown, working on a fix to have more accurate prices).
Using this tool ourselves we were able to actual visit new destinations that had a pricier flight, but was much cheaper overall due to great value and low cost Airbnbs. In the past we would search cheap flights first, then find accommodation resulting in a pretty high total cost. But for long stays and vacations, accommodation quickly becomes the largest cost.
For tech stack, I'm still new/beginner so using React with Material-UI, Supabase, and API's for the results.
I’d love feedback from the community—especially on features you’d find helpful or ideas to improve discovery. This is a bootstrapped solo build, so I’m learning a lot as I go. Ask me anything!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN,
I'd like to share a project that I've been working on to try out Shadcn/ui: GlintFlow commenting system
It's an early stage commenting system that has claps (like in Medium) instead of likes/dislikes, and people can give up to 50 claps.
It's built with NextJS (the usual suspect) and Shadcn.
Right now it's extremely simple, you can give claps (on article/page and comments) and add comments as guest (no login required). Planning to add more features like spam protection, user login to post, moderation, dashboard, analytics etc. if there's interest.
I hope you find GlintFlow as engaging and useful as I do and would love to get feedback on it!
You can check it out at https://glintflow.com, just scroll down to find a demo instance of it.
## Motivation ##
Firstly, I wanted to try out shadcn on a simple-enough project. I've mainly been using Mantine.js which have been great, and looks great, but honestly Shadcn looks even more amazing; both have very functional components. But looks aside, I wanted to see how much ease of development I'd be trading off for it - quite a bit, but not enough to drop shadcn.
Secondly, I personally the claps to be more fun/engaging than the plain like/dislike buttons but haven't really seen any third-party embeddable commenting system. So built something to see if anyone would find it useful.
If you're interested in trying embedding an instance for yourself, ping me and I'll set something up for you. Not planning to charge anything atm and will try to keep it so permanently for early adopters as long as their usage is not ridiculous.

So why did I write yet another LLM prompting library?
I found the existing Ruby ones either too abstract — hiding the LLM’s capabilities behind unseen prompts, too low-level — leaving my classes hard to follow and littered with boilerplate managing prompts and responses, or they used class level abstractions — forcing me to create classes when I didn’t want to.

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42470254</id>
        <link href="https://signwith.co/"/>
        <updated>2024-12-20T11:33:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Woke up today with a 100-degree fever & found out Google is now our competitor.
Last week, we started building signwith.co/ - a simple, pay-per-use e-signature tool for people who are struggling with complex e-sign tools.
The plan was to build quietly, run a private beta, get 50 users in 15 days, and then do a launch. Easy peasy.
But since Google dropped into the e-signature space - we needed to talk.
So after 30 minutes of existential dread, a lot of “what are we even doing?” thoughts, and one strong dose of paracetamol
we said, screw it. - let’s change gears.
So now we're opening our beta, and here's the deal:
• All the people who join will get free credits worth 10 signed docs
• 12 months credit validity
• No complexity
• No hidden cost
• No subscription commitment
You can join the beta here - http://signwith.co
That said, we see Google's entry in the signature space as validation.
This event expanded the market with such massive awareness.
Let me be clear: We’re not trying to be DocuSign, Google, or any other enterprise beast.
We’re indie makers and building for:
• The freelancers
• The consultants
• The indie and small business owners
• and anyone who just needs a contract signed—fast, simple, no headaches.
Here’s how SignWith works:
• Upload your doc
• Drop signature spots
• Send it out and track
• Pay per signed document
That’s it. No subscriptions. No feature bloat. No crazy hidden charges and no complex pricing tiers.
If you've read it so far, would love to see you on the other side.
And hey, if you’ve got any feedback, suggestions, or just want to tell us what you need, reply here or drop me a DM. We’re all ears!
Cheers!

Anthony Olson wanted a career, children, a partner with whom he could hike Montana’s trails. Despite the diabetes diagnosis at age 4, the anemia, the kidney transplant that failed at age 29, the dialysis, he clung to those dreams. He attended community college and later moved from his parents’ house in Helena to study accounting at Montana Tech in Butte. He thought he might live a nearly normal life.
All of that was taken away in early 2011 when an oncologist at St. Peter’s, Helena’s only hospital, diagnosed him with myelodysplastic syndrome, a blood disorder that’s often described as pre-leukemia. The life expectancy of…]]></summary>

After the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, President Joe Biden issued an executive order tasking the federal government with assessing the “devastating implications for women’s health“ of new state abortion bans.
Experts were warning that these bans would interfere with critical medical care and lead to preventable deaths. And the states that passed the laws had little incentive to track their consequences.
Biden directed the secretary of Health and Human Services to make sure federal agencies were “​​accurately measuring the effect of access to repro…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rerun 0.21 comes with a new graph viewer that's written in Rust and runs in the browser via wasm. It's powered by a new force based layout engine that is a port of much of d3-force to Rust. (The release also contains some other cool stuff like undo/redo implemented on top of a timeseries DB.)
We built this with applications in robotics and spatial computing in mind but would love to hear feedback from folks that would see this as useful in other domains as well.

I built Aidea because I was tired of piling up business ideas in random notes without moving forward. With AIdea, you enter a short description of your idea, and the AI returns a structured, research-driven breakdown:
• Pitch basics: value prop, unique selling points
• Market and competitor analysis (with sources)
• Branding/name suggestions
• Ways to validate and build an MVP (including recommended tech stacks)
• Monetization strategies
• User sentiments from Reddit, Quora, and articles
• TAM, SAM, SOM estimates and related market trends

It’s still early, and I’d love your feedback. Is it helpful? What would make it more valuable to you?

After installing my first eSIM, I knew there was no going back to buying plastic SIMs at airports or overpaying with my domestic provider. The simplicity of setting up an eSIM in just a few taps has revolutionized how I stay connected while travelling—and it’s driving competition and lowering costs for everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN,
I created DiaScore to help diabetics and pre-diabetics make smarter food choices. Managing blood sugar can be overwhelming, especially when it comes to understanding how different foods impact your health. DiaScore simplifies this by providing a clear score (0-100) for foods, based on key nutritional factors like carbs, fiber, added sugars, and protein.
The idea came from my personal experience with pre-diabetes and the constant challenge of deciphering food labels. DiaScore uses a science-backed formula to evaluate foods and offers actionable insights, empowering users to make better decisions quickly.
It’s powered by GeminiAI to get started but we are exploring Nutrition APIs for comprehensive food data if there's traction.
I’d love your feedback on how to improve it and make it more helpful! You can try it here: https://www.isthisdiabeticfriendly.com/
Let me know what you think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I developed an app to help clean up phone storage. Its main feature is to find similar photos in the photo album and provide a convenient interface for you to filter them. It also has a video compression feature that can significantly reduce the size of videos.
I know there are already many similar applications on the App Store, but there are always aspects of their design or interaction that I don't like, so I developed one myself. The process of thinking about app design and interaction made me feel that launching an app is quite interesting.
The app went live a few weeks ago, and for the first three days after the launch, I adopted a limited free strategy. On the first day, over 5,000 people claimed a lifetime license for free, and then I continuously received feedback from people who wanted to suggest improvements for the app. This process made me feel more connected with others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'd like share about my sideproject https://gribstream.com
It is an API to extract weather forecasting data from the National Blend of Models (NBM) https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/mdl/nbm and the Global Forecast System (GFS) https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/gl... . The data is freely available from AWS S3 in grib2 format which can be great but also really hard (and resource intensive) to work with, especially if you want to extract timeseries over long periods of time based on a few coordinates. Being able to query and extract only what you want out of terabytes of data in just an http request is really nice.
What is cool about this dataset is that it has hourly data with full forecast history so you can use the dataset to train and forecast other parameters and have proper backtesting because you can see the weather "as of" points in time in the past. It has a free tier so you can play with it. There is a long list of upcoming features I intend to implement and I would very much appreciate both feedback on what is currently available and on what features you would be most interested in seeing. Like... I'm not sure if it would be better to support a few other datasets or focus on supporting aggregations.
Features include:
- A free tier to help you get started
- Full history of weather forecasts
- Extract timeseries for thousands of coordinates, for months at a time, at hourly resolution in a single http request taking only seconds.
- Supports as-of/time-travel, indispensable for proper backtesting of derivative models
- Automatic gap filling of any missing data with the next best (most recent) forecast.
Please try it out and let me know what you think :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zack Rosenblatt, Dianna Russini, and Michael Silver have written a devastating profile of the most dysfunctional franchise in all of U.S. pro sports, the New York Jets, whose dysfunction has a clear and obvious root cause: meddling idiot owner Woody Johnson (heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune). One example:
A few weeks later, Douglas and his Broncos counterpart, George
Paton, were deep in negotiations for a trade that would have sent
Jeudy to the Jets and given future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron
Rodgers another potential playmaker. The Broncos felt a deal was
near. Then, abruptly, it all fell apart. In Denver’s executive
offices, they couldn’t believe the reason why.
Douglas told the Broncos that Johnson didn’t want to make the
trade because the owner felt Jeudy’s player rating in “Madden
NFL,” the popular video game, wasn’t high enough, according to
multiple league sources. The Broncos ultimately traded the
receiver to the Cleveland Browns. Last Sunday, Jeudy crossed the
1,000-yard receiving mark for the first time in his career.
Coming into this season, the Jets had hopes of ending the
franchise’s 13-year playoff drought — the longest in the four
major men’s North American sports — and quieting years of talk
about the franchise’s dysfunction. Instead, this season has only
cemented the Jets’ reputation.
The fans of every other team in the NFL that is having a disappointing season — like yours truly — are all texting this story to each other today, with the same message: “At least we’re not the Jets.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Podyssey is an AI-powered podcast discovery platform that redefines how users find and consume podcasts. Instead of relying on metadata or broad categories like “comedy” or “society & culture” for search and recommendation, it segments episodes into bite-sized clips (30 seconds to 5 minutes), categorizes them using fine-tuned BERTopic, generates titles for each clip with a fine-tuned Mistral 7B (v0.2) model, and then runs semantic search on top of clip titles. This enables precise, content-focused search and personalized recommendations.
Features include:
- Granular Search: Semantic search matches queries to specific clips, not just episodes.
- Tailored Recommendations: Based on individual listening patterns.
- Ease of Sharing: Share specific podcast moments with ease.
Future plans include speaker recognition, multilingual tools, and generating news articles from transcripts. Podyssey is leveraging AI to make podcast discovery as intuitive as Google made web search.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is no reason for a normal person to know who Carlos Watson is. This is why I have made it my business to reach as many members of the normal-person community with the Good News about the disgraced and deliriously scammy founder and figurehead of Ozy Media, who was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison for various oafish and common financial crimes earlier this week. I understand that my personal grievances with, say, Vice Media founder Shane Smith are my own, and my own problem; I understand, too, that there is no reason for really anyone to know who Jim Spanfeller is, although I have not always honored that. I get all this.
But it is my belief that Watson's baroquely thirsty and fraudulent public arc, while powered by the specific scamminess and scuzz of online media during the previous decade, is wild and weird enough to resonate even with people lucky enough to have avoided working in that field during that time. We put that to the test this week by having our buddy and former GMG executive editor Susie Banikarim on to talk about her new podcast about Watson's rise and fall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We built a (free) tool that tracks deprecation warnings at runtime (ruby only for now). It's a gem you install that works like Sentry or Rollbar, but aggregates deprecation warnings instead of exceptions. Docs are at https://docs.infield.ai/docs/monitor-deprecation-warnings
We built this because we rely on deprecation warnings at Infield as one piece of safely upgrading large Rails apps. Often large apps don't have perfect test coverage of all their gem usage, or use different codepaths in staging/prod than you on CI. There are good existing open source tools like https://github.com/Shopify/deprecation_toolkit for tracking deprecations in your CI suite but they don't work well in prod.
Our tool works as an open source gem that you install (https://github.com/infieldai/infield-ruby) which spins up a background thread that collects deprecation warnings and reports them to our API. We aggregate them there and track them over time so you can verify you've addressed them before you push an upgrade. It works for any deprecation that goes through ActiveSupport::Deprecation, which covers Rails and a bunch of Ruby gems but not ruby itself (that'll come!).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This tree, thought to be over 1,000 years old, is truly remarkable, not just because of its age but also due to its link to Malta's ancient farming methods. The carob tree, which is native to the Mediterranean, has been grown on the island for many years for its sturdy pods. These pods were important for food, animal feed, and even as a way to measure precious stones, leading to the term "carat." 

The tree's large size and its twisted, sprawling branches make it a beautiful sight for visitors. Its bark is deeply marked by time, and the wide spread of its limbs gives it a grand, almost magical presence. This old carob tree symbolizes Malta's rich farming traditions, and its long life showcases how well carob trees can adapt to the island's dry climate.

Top o' Hill Terrace, known to some as "Vegas before Vegas," was designed and built to cover outright debauchery under a façade of only the most prim and proper dining that the suburbs of Dallas could offer. 

Top o' Hill Terrace began its life as exactly what it seemed to be: an exclusive, upstanding restaurant nestled in a beautiful, spacious campus at one of the highest points in the county. But with the opening of the Arlington Downs horse track nearby, came the opportunity to bet on its races. By the late 1920s, Top o' Hill Terrace had been literally hollowed out to a new purpose.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is a beloved media tradition: when a dysfunctional team's dysfunctional season reaches its dysfunctional end, reporters covering that team are permitted to write one big notebook-dumping explainer/eulogy. With a few outré exceptions, no one cares enough about bad teams to justify two such stories; with a few outré exceptions, no team is quite dysfunctional enough to fill out more than one. If you are a Tennessee Titans fan, to take one example, this is more or less the one big thing you have left to look forward to this season. You already know the team is lousy, inert, soggy and sodden and miserable; in a few weeks, once everyone goes home, you will find out whether that has anything to do with Tony Pollard's insistence upon letting his pet puma wander around the locker room or some such thing. That is how it usually works.
But the New York Jets are different. Everyone always and already knows about the pumas wandering around the locker room. Every week their ulcerous and increasingly haggard quarterback joins Pat McAfee's ESPN show via Zoom, seemingly from the Black Lodge, and starts Speaking Real Words about the germ theory of disease or whatever else is troubling him; this week, Aaron Rodgers testily demanded that critics of his (terrible!) recent play disclose their vaccination status, either as an indication of their bias or just as proof that they lack the courage that permitted Rodgers to self-immunize against infectious disease, possibly by eating hundreds of small, smooth rocks. This is just how the Jets are, and more or less how they have been since the pharmaceutical heir Woody Johnson bought the team 25 years ago. That they have the longest streak in American pro sports without a playoff appearance is not surprising given all that, but also feels somehow incidental to the organization's broader project, which under Johnson's blithely buttheaded stewardship has mostly been to generate news about people getting fired.]]></summary>

While many libraries exist that mimic Rust's `Result`, I haven't seen any in this style. I think this library's approach is more simple and approachable, and I've already seen benefits when using it in my other projects.
Any feedback, PRs, etc is appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the news that everything was thinking about, Mercedes announced Thursday morning that Valtteri Bottas would be returning to the team as its reserve driver. Bottas spent the past three years as an unfortunate, i.e. racing for Alfa Romeo–turned–Kick Sauber, but up until 2021, Bottas had represented everything a championship-winning team needed in a second driver: fast enough to ensure 1-2 finishes, good enough in qualifying to occasionally beat Lewis Hamilton, not quite good enough to disrupt a clear 1-2 hierarchy. The full circle continues what has been considered one of the kinder arcs for a second driver post-eviction: freed from the pressure of one-year contracts and matching up against literally Lewis Hamilton, Bottas grew a mullet and a mustache, posted ass, and then managed to return to Mercedes with zero expectations.
If Sergio Pérez has half that, he will be fortunate. Red Bull announced yesterday that Pérez would be leaving the team after three seasons. Pérez is already missing out on the clean end-of-term-into-multi-year-contract-with-another-team sequence that Bottas got. Lest anyone forgets, Pérez's contract was initially due to expire at the end of the 2024 season, but six months ago, Red Bull Racing announced that they had extended his contract by two years. This was a baffling decision at face value, but could be explained by the disaster of Red Bull leadership, McLaren evading consideration as legitimate Constructors' Championship contender, Daniel Ricciardo still being in the second VCARB seat, and Pérez having a far worse second half of the season compared to his first—he had four podiums prior to the extension, and zero after. In the end, Red Bull had to worm its way out of an easily avoidable extension, and took a no doubt expensive route to an inevitable result; Sergio Pérez lasted for longer than expected, but he, too, fell victim to the curse of the second Red Bull seat.]]></summary>

This uses the official live telemetry stream from Lightstreamer, although – at least at the moment – it doesn't eg. check what the signal status is so telemetry might be down altogether and you'd never know. Maybe in v0.2.
Native menu bar application, so it doesn't require running a copy of Chromium and Node to show you two emojis and a percentage.
I got the idea for this when somebody linked to https://iss-mimic.github.io/Mimic/ joking about how we can see in real time how full the urine tank on the ISS is; after I understood that there's a public live telemetry stream I knew in my heart I had to do something very silly with it. I've also finally been learning Swift and macOS programming in general and I figured this'd be an excellent first Swift project, so here we all are.
Just as an aside, the "ISS Mimic" project itself is very interesting and worth checking out (https://github.com/ISS-Mimic/Mimic). I'm in no way, shape or form affiliated with them and they have no idea who I am.

As it's written using modern ES features and due to its isomorphic nature, it can be run in both browsers and runtimes (Node, Deno, Bun) without any changes.
This makes it ideal for client-side and server-side rendering, as well as static site generation, whichever environment you prefer.

Years ago, I built a personal feedback platform called Sarahah that got famous but was eventually removed from stores. One unique aspect of Sarahah was its simple, plain message box.
Now, I'm using this concept to help businesses gather raw feedback (yes, just plain free text) from their customers. This approach contrasts with guided surveys that can often frame and limit responses. On the business side, we use AI to analyze this feedback and provide valuable insights and recommendations.
I would really appreciate hearing your thoughts
Additionally, if you're interested in using this in your startup where we hear your feedback and tailor it to your needs, please let me know

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN community, happy Thursday!
I’m excited to share something I’ve been working on over the past few weeks: Thumbly.
You’ve probably seen those dynamic social media thumbnails when you share a GitHub repository on Twitter or other social media. Thumbly can bring that same functionality to your website.
With Thumbly, you can generate dynamic social media thumbnails for every page of your site. These thumbnails can automatically change based on the parameters you set, so each page has its own unique design. No need to manually create or upload different thumbnails every time you publish new content.
I originally built Thumbly for one of my own side projects because I wanted dynamic, GitHub-style thumbnails for social media shares. I’d love to share it with others who might find it useful. So this is basically a side-project of a side-project.
There’s no signup page yet, but feel free to reach out to me via email. I’ll be happy to help you integrate Thumbly into your website or even set it up on your own server.
I’m actively using Thumbly myself, so I’ll continue to improve and add features. Your feedback and ideas would mean a lot as I refine it!
And if you are not happy with the pricing, I'd be happy to discuss something that fit your requirements and site's workload.

ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.
As doctors navigate risks of criminal prosecution in states with abortion bans, hospital leaders and lawyers have left them to fend for themselves with minimal guidance and, at times, have remained “conspicuously and deliberately silent,” according to a 29-page report released Thursday by Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden. The poor direction is leading to delays in emergency care for patients facing pregnancy complications, the report concluded.

What’s Planship?
Planship [1] provides guardrails and tooling for SaaS plan packaging, dimensions, entitlements, metering, enterprise onboarding/provisioning, upsell logic, experimentation, and other related tasks.
Planship allows for the creation of levers (AKA pricing dimensions) and specific lever values (“Entitlements”), which are then grouped together within plans (AKA packages, tiers, Stripe “products”, etc.) that customers and teams subscribe to. Entitlements can be feature-based, usage-based, seat-based, or any combination of models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taco Bell's Crispy Chicken Nuggets feature white-meat chicken bites marinated in jalapeno buttermilk," breaded with a mix of breadcrumbs and tortilla chips, and then deep-fried.

A 10-piece order included two dipping sauces and cost me $7.49. I went with the new Bell Sauce and Hidden Valley Fire Ranch.
There was quite a bit of variance in the size of the nuggets. The smallest piece was about half the size of the largest piece:



The breading was fairly thick with an almost knobby texture to it. I could see bits of tortilla chips sporadically embedded in it and some odd dark patches on the surface. It was lightly crispy but super crunchy when a piece of chip was encountered. The chicken inside was moist and decently tender. There was a lightly seasoned flavor to the nuggets and just a hint of spicy heat. Quality-wise, it's about the same level as frozen breaded chicken bites heated in the air fryer.



The new Bell Sauce offered a sweet tomato flavor and a distinct pepper note to go with a fair amount of spices, a mild heat, and a creamy, tangy mayo base.
The Hidden Valley Fire Ranch is a mixture of Hidden Valley Ranch and Fire Sauce. It was more run-of-the-mill versus the Bell Sauce. It offered the creamier buttermilk tang and herbiness of Hidden Valley ranch with an additional hit of tang and a moderate heat from Taco Bell's Fire Sauce.



I found both sauces enjoyable but preferred the Bell Sauce as it was more complex and interesting.
At the end of the day, Taco Bell's Crispy Chicken Nuggets made for a decent but middling fast-food chicken nugget offering but with some added novelty from the new sauces.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was an eventful year for our award's namesake. Shams Charania's mentor-turned-rival Adrian Wojnarowski left ESPN in September to take a job in college basketball. Just three weeks later, Charania left The Athletic and assumed Woj's place as "Senior NBA Insider." This was perhaps always his destiny, since he was a news-breaking teenage prodigy: to speak his beautiful sentences on linear TV, to appear in a little photo inset for news graphics. In November, Charania was granted an award for basketball writing besides ours: first place in the Professional Basketball Writers Association's 2024 Blumenthal Memorial Writing Contest, for his co-bylined work with The Athletic's Jon Krawczynski. If any of the other awardees are reading this post, please reach out: We're curious to know what it's like to learn that you have won an award for good writing, and then, within the same sentence, learn that Shams Charania has also won it.
It is momentous to present the Shamsy in this strange year of "artificial intelligence." Sometimes critics compare the scoopster prose style to the output of a large language model; I find this funny, but off the mark. While often factually wrong and semantically hollow, an LLM's sentences typically scan like sentences that real humans might produce. Perhaps lazy or thoughtless humans trying to cheat on their homework, but real ones. These models are, after all, trained on a huge corpus of human writing. But the compositions of Shamsy award winners are compelling precisely because they deviate from default human rhythms. Man has not yet devised an intelligence that can report a Jarred Vanderbilt injury in such a disorienting fashion. For now, the human mind is more flavorfully stupid than its technological successors. That's what makes these nominees some of the most innovative writers working today, and that's why we're grateful to sift through these submissions.]]></summary>

Betrayal
Ari Tuckman’s survey of ‘mixed’ ADHD relationships suggests there are a lot of affairs in ADHD-impacted relationships.  I’m not surprised by this.  While some people are just serial non-monogamists or thrill seekers, many of the affairs I see in my work have to do with power-imbalances and that is just really, really common in couples impacted by ADHD.
For ADHD partners, affairs can be related to falling into the low-status ‘child’ roll in parent-child dynamics.  An affair partner provides feelings of importance and appreciation again.  For non-ADHD partners, having a chronically dis…]]></summary>

It’s Thomastag, or Thomas Day, in remembrance of the Apostle Thomas, who doubted the resurrection of Christ the longest and was the last disciple to “move out of the darkness.”

Grossarl is an historic market town in the Tyrolean Alps encircled by working dairy farms and mountain meadows. In recent years, it’s become a destination for winter sports and its traditional Advent market. On this particular morning, a band of colorfully costumed locals is lining up in the semi-darkness to embark on a seven-and-a-half-mile journey across its snowy hillsides that will last until sunset.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ernie Adams was a gearhead from an early age. As a child, he would attach junkyard motors to bicycles and wagons to make running vehicles. In 1962, he came up with the idea of building miniature versions of real cars. By 1965, he was able to build a working scaled-down 1928 Chevy two-door sedan made out of nine old refrigerators and powered by a two-cylinder, 13-horsepower Onan motor.

Since then, Adams has built countless 11/16th scale model cars, all of them street-legal and complete with windshield wipers, air conditioning, and radios. In 1979, he ventured into race cars, participating in the first dwarf car race at the 1983 Yavapai County Fair. Before his recent retirement from building cars due to old age, he ventured into building classic touring cars.

Adams and his family, who are originally from Harvard, Nebraska, now operate a museum on their Arizona property showcasing some of his work. He often hangs out at the museum. On site, one can view a short film and book explaining how he creates his vehicles. One can also see his workshop and other cars and related memorabilia he has collected.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marko here from Codaxy. For over two years, we have been working on CxReports, a low-code tool for creating user-facing PDF documents and reports.
We first saw the problem in wealth management, where reports are crucial for the user experience. Software vendors have customers who ask for customized reports with unique content, branding, and visuals. The solution was to build a tool that allows customization for each customer, which even customers themselves can use. Over time, this evolved to be a generic solution that works for various other use cases.
CxReports lets you build reports visually. You can connect to a database and get data using SQL queries. It supports scheduled report generation and delivery. The API enables accessing CxReports from other applications or workflows.
You can easily try it out with our Docker image -
https://docs.cx-reports.com/getting-started/docker/.
We offer a free tier for registered users.
https://cx-reports.com/
How do you currently handle customized reporting? Are there specific challenges you face with generating user-facing reports? I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback.
Looking forward to the discussion!

Here’s my attempt at dethroning the chokehold that festive Pillsbury sugar cookies have on me
 For me and many other Americans who grew up on Pillsbury cookie dough, it’s not officially the holidays until I’ve had my share of sugar cookies printed with reindeer, Christmas trees, and snowmen. These presliced sugar cookies have been the nostalgic flavor of December for as long as I can remember, and the printed designs only add to the whimsy.
It got me thinking: How hard could it be to replicate these fanciful cookies from scratch? I’ve only ever attempted slice-and-bake cookies once before, when I was in middle school, and my lack of patience with chilling the dough led to a puddle of butter and sugar in my baking tray. Could I redeem myself with an impressive sug…]]></summary>

Don’t want to fry a mountain of potatoes for Hanukkah? These frozen latkes have got you covered. 
 I’m a pretty stubborn latke cook. Even well into a Hanukkah party, when others have graciously offered to step in on the stove or told me there are, in fact, already enough latkes to feed an army of Macabees, I persevere at my task. Call me a perfectionist. Call me a kvetcher. But I have a lot of opinions about making latkes and I’ll see them through. 
I understand that not everyone shares that passion. And I get that frying a batch of latkes can leave your home smelling like grease and onions for weeks (a Hanukkah miracle!) and create a heck of a mess. For anyone who prefers not to fry their own latkes, there are — a welcome surprise to me — some great, pre-cooked optio…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s the perfect snack, martini garnish, and girl dinner star. Now, the mighty olive takes candle form for the 14th day of the Eater Advent Calendar.
 


I love big, non-candle-shaped candles as much as the next person — but, as a dirty martini-lover, I especially love it when they’re shaped like fist-sized olives. Nata Concept Store has taken our cultural obsession with aperitivo snacks of late (is tinned fish and cheese still “girl dinner”?) to new heights with its very White Elephant-worthy food-shaped candles, and this giant cocktail olive has my vote for so many reasons. Not only would it look delightful surrounded by a moat of artichoke dip, but the modest 2-inch height makes it ideal for dinner parties, as it won’t obstruct the views of your guests. I also appreciate that its rounded shape will help it burn without falling and spilling all over the place like some other non-candle-shaped candles I have purchased (to those wondering, butt-shaped candles are best left un-burnt). Most importantly, of course, it pays homage to one of my favorite savory snacks. 



No peeking! But check out what the Eater Advent Calendar has already revealed.  And check back each day for a new clutch condiment, gadget, or nibble that, yes, makes an amazing gift — but these surprises are just for you.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN,
I've recently been trying out and using the latest and greatest software development agents, including Windsurf and Cursor.
Before using those, I had been using aider for everyday practical SWE tasks, but aider is not very agentic --it's best at one-off, scoped programming tasks.
I did a quick test by putting aider in a ReAct loop using create_react_agent from langchain. To my surprise, it ended up working very well --it's able to solve programming tasks that Windsurf has failed at.
The agent has access to many tools such as ripgrep, fuzzy find, filesystem navigation, etc. One tool, in particular, is an expert tool where it can use a dedicated reasoning model, such as OpenAI's o1, to reason about logic, bugs, or complex planning tasks. It's been really interesting to see when and how it decides to use these tools.
The project does support plugging in any model you want to use, but so far I've found it to work best with the latest claude as the agent, and o1-preview (or o1 if you have access to it) for the expert reasoning model.
This is something I put together out of practical need, so if you have ideas, feedback, or especially PRs, those are welcome.
The project is licensed as Apache 2.0 (same as aider) and is intended to be a public good --our open tool so we aren't all dependent on proprietary tools and services to get our work done. The dream is that it will eventually work well on fully open/local models.
Cheers

You don’t have to do the most or spend the most, but you do have to make some effort
 Before the pandemic, I didn’t cook for other people too often. It was easy to make excuses. Namely, it’s hard to fit people in my apartment for a dinner party; why not just go out to dinner? As we began to ease back into socialization though, not everyone I wanted to see was on the same page about dining out. Yet they, like me, were stymied by various logistical constraints when it came to dinner parties — not having a table big enough to seat everyone, or not having the desire to both offer up their space and cook.
Potlucks, then, emerged as a happy medium: Someone would volunteer their space, the rest of us would bring food, and ever…]]></summary>

- I maintain it as code with auto-generating visualization
- The map updates live as our community contributes
- Anyone can contribute in minutes

The goal is to help devs choose the right tools and plan their AI infrastructure while the community maintains the most current view of the ecosystem.

Known as the Ring of Senicianus (or the Ring of Silvianus), the gold ring dates back to fourth-century Roman Britain and was discovered in 1785 by a farmer plowing a field near Silchester. The ring is inscribed with the Latin phrase "SENICIANE VIVAS IIN DE," which, is believed to be a misspelled and cropped transcription of "Senicianus vivas in Deo," meaning "Senicianus lives well in God."

I got frustrated with YouTube constantly forcing dubbed audio tracks on me. Since there's no built-in option to default to original audio, I built a Chrome extension to solve this. It automatically switches any video to its original audio track, no matter where you are. No setup needed - just install and forget it.
This is perfect if you're tired of YouTube pushing dubbed content on you.
Try it out: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/youtube-original-au...
I would love to hear your feedback!

Under the hood, it uses GPT to generate gift ideas then search for products. Right now, it’s integrated with Amazon, but I’m exploring adding more platforms and refining the personalization to assist better.
I started this as a fun side project after struggling to find thoughtful gifts myself. It’s helped my friends to get perfect ideas, but I’d love feedback from the HN community:
Does it solve a problem you care about? Any ideas for features or improvements?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rafting through the Cañon del Güejar means traversing through 500 million-year-old rock formations amid the Sierra de la Macarena (Macarena Mountain Range), one of the world’s most biodiverse areas. It is part of the Guiana Shield, an ancient geological formation that spans parts of Colombia, Brazil, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and southern Venezuela. It is a ride through archaic landscapes, primeval forests, and the cascading waterfalls of the Rio Güejar (Güejar river).  

The region is relatively new to tourism. Until about 10 years ago, it was controlled by FARC guerillas and classified as a “red zone” conflict area, one of the most dangerous areas in the country. Now it’s attracting adventure tourists looking to experience the natural beauty of Colombia’s more remote topography. Since it is also a wildlife refuge surrounded by national parks, prepare for an abundance of animal sightings including bears, otters, and a variety of bird species. One of the notable landmarks is the El Cerro del Indio Acostado, an ancient rock formation that looks like a man’s profile and is beloved by locals. 

During the rafting experience, there are myriad opportunities to bathe in waterfalls and swim in the crystalline waters of the Rio Güejar in between navigating the gushing rapids. Don’t rush to leave the region after the rafting adventure because there’s a variety of nature activities to fully immerse yourself in, like tubing, horseback riding, and hiking; all of which support the local families who are building tourism options in their communities.]]></summary>

I built Transcrib.ee to help me generate transcripts for lectures on YouTube with no captions, especially multilingual lectures. I was constantly frustrated with videos that had no transcripts or inaccurate ones, so I built a tool and decided to share it with everyone.
This tool uses Groq (an AI inference engine that's different from Grok and offers very fast processing) and OpenAI's Whisper model (really accurate in multilingual) to quickly transcribe any YouTube video, regardless of the language. It's been a game-changer for my studies!
To make it even faster, I created a Chrome extension that lets you get transcripts using a keyboard shortcut or directly from the YouTube video player by clicking the Transcrib.ee button. I hope it helps you too! Try it out and let me know what you think: https://www.transcrib.ee/

I built a simple accessibility widget, which can be embedded on any website for free. 
No signup required, just a line of (defer) code to copy & paste.
It'll not slow your website down, and once installed, there's a blue accessibility icon fixed to the lower right side of the screen, what can it do?
* highlight links and headers
* pause all animations
* increase font size
* change contract
* hide images
* and more!
Any feedback would be great, maybe you miss a feature? Looking forward to your thoughts!
Thanks,
Simon

It's a set of tools that have allowed me to prototype quickly small (and increasingly bigger) kernels, and create userspace programs to interact with them.
Supports riscv64, amd64 and i386. The intel port has been tested and used on real hardware, from big dual-socket Xeon machines to an old X220.
It is all C, I have plan to make rust bindings for the kernel library. But again, they're plans at this stage.
Porting to new architectures is relatively simple, a basic port to riscv took me a couple of weeks of spare-time hacking.
While still at early stage, has now reached the point where I believe it can be useful to more people than just me.
Let me know what you think :-)

The scoreboard glowed with the promise of another Friday night football game in Liberty, Mississippi, a small town near the Louisiana border. The Trojans, in black and gold, sprinted onto the field to hollers from friends and families who filled barely half the bleachers.
The fans were almost all Black, as is the student body at the county’s lone public high school. Scanning the field and the stands would give you little indication that more than half the county’s residents are white. …]]></summary>

        <link href="https://github.com/tide-foundation/tidecloak-gettingstarted"/>
        <updated>2024-12-19T10:17:52.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey HN!
After 6 years of R&D, our small team is excited to share our project TideCloak - an IAM designed to help developers move fast without worrying about catastrophic breaches or overpowered admins with keys to the kingdom.
Traditional IAMs rely on centralized authority - admins, root certificates, and decryption keys - which create glaring vulnerabilities in a breach. To address this, we’ve integrated Keycloak (Red Hat’s IAM) with a decentralized key architecture powered by our (academically validated) Ineffable Cryptography.
Here’s the idea: keys are split across a decentralized network (our Cybersecurity Fabric) so no one ever holds the full key. Even in a breach or F$%k up, there’s no unchecked authority exposed.
Right now, TideCloak uses the Cybersecurity Fabric as an IdP, meaning users authenticate without their credentials being stored or shared. Essentially, users bring their own authority - without needing to trust anyone else to keep it safe.
Coming soon:
- Identity Governance Administration to prevent super admin abuse.
- User-sovereign digital assets, where assets are secured with unique decentralized keys to protect against mass breaches.
We’ve just launched a free developer sandbox, and we’d love your feedback:
https://github.com/tide-foundation/tidecloak-gettingstarted
It’s still early stages, and your input will help us improve.
Thanks for taking a look - ask us anything!

The women were having miscarriages. They were bleeding and in pain.
They needed a medical procedure to clear their uterus, but their doctors delayed it or didn’t even counsel them about it. Our yearlong investigation found that abortion laws are affecting how physicians treat pregnancy loss and other complications because the procedures used in these cases are also used for abortions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RAGLite is a Python package for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.
RAG applications can be magical when they work well, but anyone who has built one knows how much the output quality depends on the quality of retrieval and augmentation.
With RAGLite, we set out to unhobble RAG by mapping out all of its subproblems and implementing the best solutions to those subproblems. For example, RAGLite solves the chunking problem by partitioning documents in provably optimal level 4 semantic chunks. Another unique contribution is its optimal closed-form linear query adapter based on the solution to an orthogonal Procrustes problem. Check out the README for more features.
We'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions, and are happy to answer any questions!

  - Share PDFs with an external audience via a link or a QR Code. Shared PDFs can be access controlled
  - Dark Mode, colored themes and custom theme colors
  - Inverted color mode for reading PDFs
  - SSO support via OIDC

  - view PDFs seamlessly in the browser of my desktop and mobile devices
  - every user can upload files
  - can be self-hosted via Docker
  - minimal and resource-friendly
  - SSO support

  - They are using the inbuilt PDF viewer of the browser. This works fine on desktops and laptops but on smartphones it will simply download the PDF file and not display it in the browser.
  - They are really feature rich and therefore resource-hungry. I did not need fancy AI or OCR. I just wanted to view and organize my PDFs.
  - The content needs to be curated by an admin user. Normal users are not allowed to add PDFs.
  - PDFs can not be uploaded via the UI. PDFs can not be uploaded via the UI.

The idea came from my own struggles keeping track of trip details—flights, itineraries, places I wanted to visit, and even the random thoughts I had along the way. Nothing out there felt personal enough or flexible enough, so I decided to build it myself.
What makes Voyalog different is how laid-back and flexible it is. It doesn’t try to control every aspect of your trip. You can use it to plan as much or as little as you want. It’s also a super clean way to keep your photos and attachments organized, with free cloud storage included.
As a digital nomad and solo developer, I’ve put my heart into this. I’d love to hear your thoughts—whether you find it helpful, see areas for improvement, or even if it’s something you’d actually use. I have plenty of ideas to expand and improve the app, but first, I want to make sure it truly resonates and makes sense for others.
For me, the coolest part is how easy it makes reliving your trips. Like instantly pulling up a photo of the amazing ramen you had in Tokyo months ago, instead of digging through thousands of random pictures.
The app doesn't even require an account, so you can use it right away. It's only available on Android at the moment.
If this sounds interesting, I’d love for you to try it and let me know what you think. Any feedback is appreciated! You can download it from here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.voyalog.ap...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joe Otterson, reporting for Variety:
“Silo” has been renewed for both Seasons 3 and 4 at Apple TV+,
with the fourth season set to be the show’s last.
The renewal news comes as the post-apocalyptic drama is currently
airing its second season. The sixth episode of Season 2 is due out
on Dec. 20. The season finale is scheduled to debut on Jan. 17.
I feel bad complaining about a good show not only getting renewed, but renewed through to a planned conclusion. I fucking hate when good shows get cancelled after one season.
But. While I really liked season 1 of Silo, season 2 has been a bore. We’re halfway through — five episodes — and everything interesting could have been put in one episode. Maybe one and half. I hope the remaining five episodes of season 2 pick up, but so far, it really feels like this entire season has just padding to get to what’s next. Hugely disappointing, really.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, Shaun here!
I originally built Magic Message Santa for my kids. They wrote Santa a letter with their Christmas wishes (like we've all done in the past) and I thought, “What if we could send Santa a voice note instead? How cool would that be!”
I knew AI was great at transcribing voice notes, but I wasn’t sure if voice generation was there yet. After some initial testing, we were genuinely amazed by the results, it felt like magic! So, I named it and opened it up to the public.
Hope you and your kids enjoy the experience as much as we do!
Would love to hear your thoughts or answer any questions you might have. Have a Merry Christmas!

The app allows you to:
- Track daily/weekly/monthly habits.
- Earn virtual coins for completing habits.
- Set personalized rewards for achieving goals.
- View progress through beautiful tile-based grids
- Mark habits as failed intentionally, so the tracking remains realistic.
The goal was to create something simple but engaging to help with consistency. It's built with FlutterFlow and Firebase, and the app is live on the App Store.
I’d appreciate any feedback or thoughts, especially if you’ve worked on similar projects or have ideas to improve it.
Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN!
I wanted to share Yakari, a tool I built to make command-line interfaces more approachable through interactive TUIs. If you've ever forgotten CLI flags or needed to look up command syntax, this might help.
Yakari turns complex commands into interactive menus. Users can navigate through options with simple key presses instead of memorizing complex command structures. If you've used Emacs and Magit (or any other Transient) before, the interface will feel familiar.
Features:
- Transform CLIs into guided menus
- Create custom menus for any CLI
- Support for flags, named parameters, choices, and interactive inputs
- Command history and contextual help
You can try it out without installing thanks to uv [1]:
  uvx --from yakari ykr demo # Play with a demo showcasing different argument types
  uvx --from yakari ykr git  # Try the git menu in any git repo

I'd love feedback from both CLI users and developers. What tools would you find most useful to have menus for? How could this make your terminal workflows easier?

It sure is old, having been established in 1654 by a Levantine Jew from Syria named Cirques Jobson, though it has only been located on the present site since (circa) 1970.

There is another claimant to the title in Oxford, the Grand Café on High Street, which was originally founded in 1650, a coffee house opened by a Jewish entrepreneur named Jacob. It is Europe's oldest in that aspect, but technically speaking, it has not continually been a coffee house throughout its history unlike the Queen's Lane Coffee House.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Through the city of Sendai runs the Hirose River. It has several stream pools along its course, one of which is known as Kashikobuchi, or the Wise Abyss, and there is a chilling legend that accounts for its name.

Once upon a time, a local man was fishing by this stream pool when he found a gossamer thread tied around his ankle. Finding it strange, the man undid it and instead tied it around the trunk of a nearby willow tree. The same thing happened over and over again, until the tree got dragged into the water with a loud noise. Dumbfounded, the man stood there watching the ripples spread on the surface of the river.

Out of the silence that followed, an ominous voice was heard saying "Kashikoi, kashikoi "(Very wise, very wise). Then the man finally saw what lurked underneath the water: a monstrous spider that reigned over the area, preying on unsuspecting villagers.

Interestingly, the same spider makes an appearance in another folk tale of Sendai. In this legend, a large eel that lived in the downstream called on another villager to aid him in a fight with the spider, asking him to stand by as a witness and not to make a sound. The next evening, the villager came to see the eel and the spider fighting, and could not help but scream in terror. This caused the eel to lose the battle, and all the villager saw was its severed head glaring at him from the water, before losing his mind and dying.

The Spider of Kashikobuchi was both feared and worshipped by the villagers, who regarded him as a god of trade and protector against floods. Today, a largely neglected stele in the thicket by National Route 48—overlooking the Kashikobuchi pool, no less—serves as the only testament to this spider god, here referred to as Myōhō-gumo-no-rei, or the Ghost of the Mystic Spider.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Masumoto Family Farm is a fourth-generation Japanese-American farm outside of Fresno, California, run by David “Mas” Masumoto and his daughter, Nikiko. The family focuses on growing heirloom stone fruits and grapes, steered by their belief that, above all else, fruit should taste amazing. That seems like an obvious goal, but in the modern market, durability and appearance have long trumped flavor in the produce aisles. So by growing delicious heirloom varieties, the Masumotos are making a radical choice. And with no guaranteed commercial buyers, they often have to rely on equally radical systems to sell their fruit. That’s why, 20 years ago, Mas decided to tread new ground to save the Elberta peach—an almost-extinct heirloom stone fruit—by creating his Adopt-a-Tree Program.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This museum's primary focus is on musical instruments that represent the diverse musical traditions of Morocco and the surrounding region. Visitors can examine a comprehensive collection of musical instruments from various ethnic and cultural groups. The displays provide context about the historical significance, construction techniques, and cultural importance of these musical artifacts.

Traditional Moroccan music is classified by its kaleidoscopic regional variations. Among the most common styles are Amazigh, Andalusi, malhun, chaabi, aita, reggada, gnawa, and guedra. Each of these styles is associated with specific ethnic groups and musical instruments. Made of locally available resources and at times with hard-to-come-by materials, these instruments required is astonishing level of artisanship.  

Architecturally, the museum preserves the splendor of a traditional Moroccan palace, with its beautiful inner courtyard and elaborately decorated rooms serving as an exceptional setting for the musical instrument exhibits. The space itself tells a story of cultural refinement, with each room carefully designed to complement the musical displays and provide visitors with an immersive experience of Morocco's musical heritage.

An inscription unearthed in the reception room attests that the building was constructed in 1882. The original owner of this palace was Ben Larbi Jamai, Grand Vizier of Sultan Moulay Hassan I. In 1912, the French authorities repurposed this building to serve as a military hospital, and a few years later, in 1920, the palace was officially recognized as a historical monument. The same year, the Museum of Indigenous Arts was opened on its premises.  Since then, the theme of the museum has undergone several transformations, and in 2014, it eventually became the National Museum of Music.]]></summary>

Watson and Ozy Media were both convicted in July of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. 
Last year Watson was indicted after New York Times reporting revealed that former Ozy Media Chief Operating Officer Samir Rao impersonated a YouTube executive on a conference call with Goldman Sachs. Both Watson and Ozy were indicted, and both pleaded not guilty throughout the trial, with Watson claiming instead that the entire trial was racially motivated, biased, and corrupt. He and his team raised more than $60,000 since March 2023 on this argument through a website titled “Too Black for Business,” and last month, supporters released a two-part, three-hour docuseries on YouTube called “The Troubling Case of Carlos Watson.”]]></summary>

Classic saimin noodle soup at a beloved diner chain, top-tier fish at the best new omakase in town, ceviche tostadas at a chill BYOB spot, and more of Honolulu’s best meals
 Outside interests have made money in Hawai‘i for centuries, including in food. Waves of restaurateurs from the continental U.S. and abroad have opened restaurants in Honolulu, with everyone from Japanese conglomerates to Michael Mina setting up shop. But simultaneously, Honolulu’s homegrown businesses have been able to ride waves of excitement to expand themselves. In the last decade, tiny mom-and-pop restaurants have opened second locations, while established local chains expanded their reach. More and more chefs have worked to learn about Hawai‘i’s history and culture to respectfully incorporate aspects into their restaurants. That is to say, diners in Honolulu are a bit spoiled for choice.
Updated, December 2024:
The winter tourist season has descended on Honolulu, and with holiday festivities in full swing, comfort foods and neighborhood stalwarts like the homey spot Moké’s Bread and Breakfast are the draw. Despite the generally warm weather, Honolulu is a soup town, and the slight dip in temperatures this time of year has people turning to only-in-Hawai‘i noodles at Palace Saimin, around since the mid-century, and clear, restorative bowls at Phở Tô Châu, an anchor in Honolulu’s Chinatown.
Eater updates this list quarterly to make sure it reflects the ever-changing Honolulu dining scene.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN,
I’m excited to share Bodo, an open-source compute engine designed for large-scale data processing in native Python. Bodo is powered by an auto-parallelizing JIT compiler and an HPC backend, enabling it to generate highly optimized, parallel binaries (MPI) for Pandas and NumPy code—all without requiring any code rewrites.
Our latest benchmark demonstrates 20x to 240x speedup over traditional distributed computing frameworks like Spark, Ray, and Dask (code and details in repo).
The inspiration for Bodo came from my background in HPC, when I saw how extremely slow and hard to use Spark was (has gotten better over the years but still not great). Of course, a compiler has its own limitations (e.g. not all Python is compilable), but I think it’s leaps and bounds better.
Let me know what you think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made 2024 Crypto Recap to make an engaging way to see how your crypto portfolio stacked up this year.
If you aren't someone who spends all day monitoring the latest in crypto, but still have some crypto on eg Coinbase, you might have a general sense of how your portfolio is doing, but might not know other things like:
- How did your portfolio fare vs the S&P 500 this year?
- What were your best and worst trades, if you had any?
- How does your crypto behavior compare to others?
I made 2024 Crypto Recap to make a fun, quick way to see all these in a familiar format.
I had the idea to make this because around the end of the year is usually when I'm checking in on my own financial situation; and a lot of the personal finance tools I use for that don't have great support for crypto. I was surprised to learn that much of this data was just an API call away thanks to Coinbase, and of course took inspiration from many of the other wrapped products out there, too.
I hope you learn something interesting and maybe get a chuckle out of it. Feedback welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever get lost searching through genetic literature? I've built a new interface for bioRxiv+medRxiv to directly browse preprint findings on the genome!
To begin I downloaded 7TB's of bioRxiv+medRxiv preprints and extracted mentions of genetic variant ID's or positions. Documented in "How to download bioRxiv on a budget": http://sitlabs.org/writing/biorxiv.html
This project started after I was trawling through Google Scholar to review a gene when I realised I had missed relevant upstream findings which hadn't been linked to the gene. I wondered if there could be a better interface to explore genetic literature?
Next I provided the variant mentions and paper context to gpt-4o-mini and requested structured output summarising the scientific finding. Finally I mapped all variants to the latest genome build and plotted them on our custom genome browser.
This project was made by the new Scientific Interface & Tooling Lab (http://sitlabs.org) at Oxford. We will be releasing new interfaces and tools to improve scientific productivity with an initial focus on biology research.

We originally launched this just under a month ago as a clip playlist generator, and while we saw some initial excitement, we soon realized a tough truth: people just don’t create playlists very often.
So, we’ve been working on refining the product into something more practical and frequently used—an answer engine. Think Perplexity, but every source is a real person speaking in a YouTube video.
We’ve been using this for product comparisons, primary source research, and getting startup advice from trusted sources (like the YC Channel).
Excited to see if you find it useful!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One last item on Acorn 8. Whether you are a longtime Acorn user (like me), or a would-be new user, you should set aside some time to actual read Acorn’s documentation. It’s a full user manual, and it not only describes, in detail, what every feature in the app does and how to use them, but also a vast array of “how-to” tutorials, many of them videos.
In broad strokes, there are two approaches to documenting a serious, professional-level app or software system. One was is a comprehensive functional reference resource. That’s a way that you, the user, can teach yourself how to use a feature, refresh your memory about a feature you haven’t used in a while, or even just check to see if a certain feature even exists. The other is a narrative, storytelling, tutorial approach. That’s not teaching yourself — that’s letting an expert teach you, and today that’s often a visual approach through video.
Acorn’s document is so thorough that it encompasses both approaches. Either one would qualify Acorn as a well-documented application. But by including both, Gus Mueller should be given some sort of medal or award. Different people learn in different ways, and Acorn’s documentation is there for everyone.
It should go without saying, but no serious tool — hardware or software — is complete without thorough, polished documentation. Acorn goes above and beyond. It’s amazing enough that a company as small as Flying Meat — it’s really just Gus and his wife Kirstin — has produced a full-fledged professional-strength image editing application that has remained modern and cutting-edge for 17 years and counting. But it’s also accompanied by first-class comprehensive documentation.

Citing a recent ProPublica investigation, Sen.

Formaldehyde, used for everything from preserving dead bodies to binding wood products and producing plastic, is extremely widespread and causes far more cancer than any toxic air pollutant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hakone is a town famed for its volcanic landscape, including a large caldera lake with a stunning view of Mount Fuji and onsen resorts. Historically, it flourished as a post station with a border checkpoint, situated on the road connecting Tokyo—then known as Edo—and Kyoto.

The 319-mile-long road was called the Tokaido or "East Sea Road," a name which survives today as a bullet train line. The cobblestone pavements of the road have survived at three points: Kanaya, Kikukawa, and Hakone.

The Hakone portion of the Old Tokaido  Way was known as a perilous point back in the Edo period, a steep mountain pass often slippery with mud. Even after it was paved with stones around the 17th century, travelers are said to have had a hard time getting past the pass.

In 1618, the shogun’s government planted cedar trees along the road, 412 of which have survived to this day as a scenic lakeside avenue. The feudal-era atmosphere still hangs in the area, and walking on the cobblestone pavement in the woods will let you feel like a journeying samurai.]]></summary>

As far as the new packaging goes, it includes new stylized typography, updated product photography, and updated product descriptions."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Pivotal Tracker shutting down soon, I built Planisphere to offer a familiar experience for teams that rely on it. Planisphere includes core project tracking features like organizing stories into projects, prioritization, estimation, and commenting.
I built this as a solo developer using Elixir and Phoenix LiveView, which means minimal JavaScript and fast load times. I’m seeing less than 100 KB in assets and pages loads in under 0.5 seconds for the project I’m using to track Planisphere’s own development.
While the major features are already in place, including user management, I’m actively building out feature parity, including integrations, dynamic iteration velocity, reporting, and more.
Planisphere offers a 14-day free trial with no credit card required, after which it’s just $6 per user per month. I’m also working on migration tools to make the transition seamless. If you’re looking for help migrating data or are interested in partnering to build these tools, reach out at martin@planisphere.dev.

I’m happy to answer any questions and would love any feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Charlotte Hornets scheduled a Christmas-themed on-court skit for a break in the second quarter of their home loss Monday to the depleted 76ers. The setup involved Hugo, the mascot of the Hornets, learning what a couple of participating children most want for Christmas, and then delivering the goods. The payoff, as far as I can tell, was supposed to come with the final wish: A kid tells Hugo, sadly, that his father is moving the family to Philadelphia, and Hugo saves the day by producing a new father, clad in a Hornets jersey, to keep the family in Charlotte. You're rolling your eyes now, but someone at the Hallmark Channel is rubbing their hands together greedily while their assistant speed-dials Luke Macfarlane.
To set up this joke, the skit had to first demonstrate that Hugo had Santa-like powers. The second and penultimate child to interact with Hugo, a 13-year-old named Jack, asked for and received a Playstation 5. In the same way that the children in the punchline did not get to keep the actor in the Hornets jersey, Jack was never intended to keep the Playstation 5; the expensive hardware was meant to establish Hugo's generosity, in order to set up the gag about how a Hornets-loving dad, to replace your regular, crappy one, would a great and wonderful gift. The Hornets were giving the gift of entertainment, to the audience, with a skit! They were not giving a PS5 to a child. Alexei Phillips, Jack's uncle, told Queen City News that after the skit the Hornets took back the PS5, and instead gave his nephew a Hornets jersey.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-12-18T16:10:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dan Moren, writing at Six Colors:
The newly released Acorn 8 adds a bunch of great
features to the mix. A few of them will be familiar to Apple
platform users: subject selection uses machine learning to let
you quickly isolate and grab the subject of a picture (there’s
also a corresponding “Remove Background” feature to simplify
that task) and a Live Text tool allows you to select and copy
text within an image.
For me, the star of the show is the fascinating Data Merge, which
is a bit like Mail Merge for images. If you’ve ever needed to
create the same image several times but with different information — nametags, for example, or personalized gift cards — this is a
life-saver. You open your template image, identify your variables,
then hand Acorn a CSV file with the relevant data and it will
process through them, assigning text where needed and even putting
images in assigned layers. It’s the kind of wild automation tool
that might not be something you need every day, but when you do
need it, there’s really no replacement.
The rare sweet spot that Acorn hits is that it’s super-approachable to new and casual users, who just need an image editor sometimes, and super-powerful for power users who want to dig in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dave Nanian, writing on the Shirt Pocket blog:
macOS 15.2 was released a few days ago, with a surprise. A
terrible, awful surprise. Apple broke the replicator. Towards
the end of replicating the Data volume, seemingly when it’s
about to copy either Preboot or Recovery, it fails with a
Resource Busy error.
In the past, Resource Busy could be worked around by ensuring
the system was kept awake. But this new bug means, on most
systems, there’s no fix. It just fails.
Since Apple took away the ability for 3rd parties (eg, us) to copy
the OS, and took on the responsibility themselves, it’s been up to
them to ensure this functionality continues to work. And in that,
they’ve failed in macOS 15.2. Because this is their code, and
we’re forced to rely on it to copy the OS, OS copying will not
work until they fix it. [...]
For those who may be working for Apple, or have good contacts, the
bug is FB16090831. A fix would be really helpful, folks.
This means Shirt Pocket’s outstanding utility SuperDuper can’t make a bootable clone of your startup drive on a machine running MacOS 15.2.0. It’s worth noting that you can still use SuperDuper (or other backup utilities) to clone all of your data, which is, by far, the most essential data in any backup. But bootable startup drives clones are an essential part of many people’s data integrity workflows.
This bug seems to affect CarbonCopyCloner and Apple’s own Time Machine, too. A bug like this is always unfortunate, but especially around the holidays, when it might take longer than usual to get fixed, even if the issue is escalated within Apple.

A born-and-raised Southern Californian with a big Mexican American family, I had never known a Christmas without a pile of corn husk-wrapped tamales waiting next to a honey ham and the half dozen other sides my mom and aunts had prepared for us, the corn masa hot and inviting, begging us to dig in.

I work as an Android developer at a large retailer, on the app that the in-store employees use to
see their schedules, view product details, get support, etc. Part of our engineering on-call 
rotation involves helping these in-store employees with any app issues they may encounter. There are
always a few times every rotation where I know solving someone's problem would be way easier if I
could just see their screen as if I were in-store with them.
However, many of these employees are non-technical and wouldn't want to go through the onboarding of
TeamViewer or Zoom, are under time constraints in a busy store, or (understandably) just wouldn't
know how to get set up.

Whether it’s poached, baked in a tart, or cooked into jam, quince can shine in both sweet and savory dishes 
 If you have ever tried membrillo — the dense Spanish jam often paired with Manchego on a nice cheese plate, maybe with a handful of Marcona almonds and a glass of Tempranillo – you know the sweet, slightly floral flavor of quince. Its appearance, however, may remain a mystery. The pink hue and uniform slices of quince paste look nothing like the golden, lumpy fruit as it hangs on a tree during the autumn harvest season. 
At a glance, quince could be mistaken for an heirloom apple or pear, but hold one in your hand and you’ll soon understand a key difference between them – this rock hard fruit cannot be eaten raw. With a little heat and a little patience, …]]></summary>

Currently, this uses screenshots and LLMs support for extracting screen UI elements effectively. This is still a work in progress and attempting to make this work with local models via Ollama (the code is in place with some issues). As of now, Gemini and GPT 4o works the best for finding UI elements and planning the task.
Some examples that work as of now:
  1. Use gmail and ask @example.com for lunch next saturday  

 2.  Start a 3+2 chess game on lichess

This improves the cost of one automation task from approx. $0.6 via Claude to:
$0.06 - OpenAI 4o mini as planner + free Gemini flash 1.5 (15 calls/min)
The Llama vision models will eventually make it 0.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a holiday promotion, fast-casual burger chain Smashburger is offering a limited-time, buy-one-get-one-free deal on any of its burgers through Tuesday, December 24, 2024.

The deal is available in-store only at participating locations (you can find a list of participating locations on the Smashburger website here). The deal is good on both single-patty and double-patty versions of the chain's various burgers.
Interestingly enough, the deal is not limited to one use (i.e. one free burger) per person so you can buy something like four burgers and get four burgers free. The relevant fine print reads as follows:

"For each burger or sandwich purchased in a transaction, receive one (1) complimentary order of any burger or sandwich (protein substitutions available) (not including applicable taxes) on the menu that is of equal or lesser value to the item purchased.  Must use promo code 4031 at checkout to redeem this offer in person at a participating location.  No limit on number of qualifying complimentary items that may be redeemed with coupon in a single transaction.  Offer valid only for item of equal or lesser value."

Holiday cookie swaps are an art form. Here’s everything you need to know to host a good one. 
 Tis the season for lots of things — hot cocoa, gift shopping, and perhaps most importantly, cookie swaps. These annual exchanges of delicious baked goods have become increasingly popular in recent years, and maybe you’ve been invited to one but aren’t exactly a great baker. Or perhaps you’re interested in hosting your first-ever cookie swap, but have no idea where to start. That’s where Aimee France, a baker and the mind behind the wildly popular Instagram account formerly known as @yungkombucha420, comes in. 
France first encountered the cookie swap as a child, when her mother would attend a yearly ladies’ nigh. “My mom would always come home with a ton of cookies, and that…]]></summary>

Last year, I quit my corporate job and went full-time on ProjectionLab, the long-term financial planning app I've been building for the past 4 years, which some of you may recognize. The decision to go all-in felt like a huge leap. But it was the right call, and it's been a good year.
And without the HN community, it would not have happened. As I mentioned last time [0], the feedback on my original Show HN is THE reason I'm still here working on this. I'm really grateful for that. And I hope the way I’ve grown PL -- staying bootstrapped and focused on users -- resonates with the early supporters who helped to shape it.
For now I'm still the only engineer, burning the candle at both ends, but luckily I'm not feeling burnt out myself!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN. I made a little JS library for streaming structured data from LLMs using leniently-parsed XML as a medium.
E.g.
    await simple('fun pet names', {
      schema: { name: Array(String) },
      model: 'openrouter:mistralai/ministral-3b'
    }); // => ["Daisy", "Whiskers", "Rocky"]

When using LLMs, I've ended up gravitating towards boring time-tested XML-esque tag-based delimiters instead of JSON/function-calling for the following reasons:
- Diverse presence in training corpuses (consider flavours of content commonly adjacent to these syntaxes vs. JSON)
- HTML was built for fallible humans to write; LLMs are equally fallible. Let them cook [html]!
- IME better and more consistent adherance than very delicate JSON/YAML etc.
- Lenient by nature (following Postel's law of being liberal …]]></summary>

I noticed senior tech folks have valuable knowledge in their work docs – processes, templates, guides. This is expertise worth thousands, sitting unused. But they rarely share it: too busy for courses, unsure about value, or overwhelmed by setup.
I built Tapflow (https://tapflow.co) to fix this:
- Notion-like editor you already know
- Drop your content, set price
- Get instant product page
- Built-in payments
Numbers:
- Some early users made $20k+ from their products
- 1000+ registered pros, mostly word of mouth, Reddit and PH
- Profitable, bootstrapped side-project
Would love feedback:
- What stops you from sharing your expertise?
- How would you price your technical knowledge?
Try it: https://tapflow.co
Stack:
Backend: nginx, express.js, Apollo GraphQL, postgreSQL, redis, Stripe
Frontend: next.js, react-query, GraphQL, Material UI, yoopta wysiwyg Hosting: AWS, DigitalOcean, bunny.net

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the time of year when the best, biggest, and most ambitious movies come out. Not Oscar season, but rather that stretch when the halls of streaming services are decked with the brightly lit, thinly disguised advertisements that are the year's new Christmas movies. There are more than 100 new Christmas films to watch this holiday season, and whether that number horrifies or excites you depends upon how much of a freak you are for the festive. Sabrina is proud to say they are a real Christmas freak, and this year they asked some of their colleagues to watch some of the most, uh, available new holiday movies. The fifth movie in our lineup is The Christmas Quest, a movie that pushes the boundary of what a neckline can be.
Sabrina Imbler: I’m so excited to talk with both of you about Hallmark’s first and potentially last foray into the special kind of love that stems from a mutual interest in Icelandic antiquities. Before we talk about the movie, I would love to learn more about your relationship with archaeology and the rich cultural traditions of Iceland. What interested you in watching this movie in particular? Had you heard of the Icelandic Yule Lads, or Jólasveinar, before?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you ever want to embed a super long string in JavaScript, and find yourself escaping quotes or interpolations by hand?
I find this comes up a lot, particularly when you're doing code generation stuff, because you need to have examples of code for the LLM, and that code often has strings embedded inside it. For example, take a look at the code properties in this JSON array[1].
Introducing stringify.org, the world's only correct-by-definition JavaScript string encoder website. It uses JSON.stringify, which is the only guaranteed method to output a string that is also valid JavaScript. It's in the spec.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
My girlfriend and I wanted to find a fun ay to improve our bird recognition skills, as birding knowledge felt so out of reach to us.
So we decided to create Birdle, a daily bird guessing game. Our journey started in South Africa with our wonderful and fortuitous collaboration with BirdLife South Africa. After the incredible and warm reception, our players convinced to finally start covering other countries. This year we worked hard to release for testing new versions for the UK and, just today, the US.
The game is also available as an app at:
- Android: https://android.birdle.world
- iOS: https://ios.birdle.world
The version is still in beta for testing, as we are still learning about US birds, so any feedback is strongly appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While building SaaS products, we noticed a recurring problem: content performance hinges on the first few words. Hooks determine success, but defining and generating effective hooks programmatically is hard.
Here’s how we approached the challenge:
1. The problem:
Attention is subjective and context-dependent. Identifying patterns that consistently work across platforms is complex.
2. Our approach:
- Data collection: Analyzed high-performing LinkedIn posts, social media ads, and email subject lines.
- Lightweight NLP system: Developed a system to identify linguistic patterns like structure, emotional triggers, and readability.
- Fine-tuned GPT models to generate hooks based on frameworks observed in the data.
3. Tech challenges we tackled:
- Balancing creativity and relevance to ensure hooks are engaging without veering into clickbait.
- Building 15+ adaptable frameworks such as curiosity-driven questions, data-backed insights, and emotional prompts.
- Iterating with user feedback to refine hook quality and ensure consistent results.
The result is a system that identifies attention-grabbing patterns and generates hooks that perform well across platforms.
We’re actively building out new features and optimizations. If you have feedback on our approach, the tech, or ideas to explore, we’d love to hear from you. Reach us at support@copytruck.com.

As a support rep, I spent months copying email templates from sticky notes. It was time-consuming and frustrating, especially when formatting got messed up.
That’s why I built Tempstr — a tool that lets you instantly access and copy your most-used templates, complete with preserved formatting, all without leaving your browser tab.
Tempstr works seamlessly with the Chromium extension I also developed, which uses a restricted API key to securely fetch your templates.
If repetitive email tasks have been a headache for you, I’d love for you to check it out and share your feedback!

        <updated>2024-12-18T12:08:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN!
We developed a browser extension that blocks distracting sites. The killer feature is that we use LLMs and user-defined goals to provide the best possible blocking experience.
The decision-making process is not binary, we have multiple categories, allowing for more nuanced user interactions. This makes the browsing experience much less frustrating compared to other website blockers.
Sites like Reddit or YouTube are not always bad, and Wikipedia or other educational resources are not always good. By considering what the user is working on, we are able to make more informed and effective decisions.
Other blockers rely on pre-made blocklists for distracting websites. This approach is clearly insufficient for most use cases, as curating such lists is tedious—whether for the developer or the user.
We've also added quality-of-life features, including whitelists, blacklists, active hours, temporary unblocking, nuclear mode and a well-integrated (and optional) Pomodoro timer.
Learnings:
Initially, we scraped page content to make decisions. However, this approach posed significant privacy concerns. Now, all our decisions are based on tab metadata, ensuring a much better level of privacy and much better performance. No page content is transferred to the server.
Data collection:
We don't store browsing data unless the user explicitly reports incorrect decisions, BYOB model version will be released soon as well based on user demand.

In my early years living in New Jersey, I keenly remember The Star-Ledger in Newark reporting on how hundreds of police officers and firefighters got anabolic steroids, human growth hormone and other forms of testosterone at taxpayer expense for medically unnecessary reasons. It was a tour de force of local journalism; something that deepened my understanding of the state where I lived.
Sadly, this kind of journalism has been harder to find as the papers that cover Jersey have struggled financially. Because the state is sandwiched between two big TV media ma…]]></summary>

Fourteen years ago, Congress set out to remedy a basic unfairness in the tax code. The tax that funds Medicare, because it’s aimed mainly at wages, hits even the poorest American workers. But the wealthy could easily avoid paying their share. So lawmakers created a new type of Medicare tax to capture the kinds of income the rich often enjoy: interest, dividends and capital gains from investments.
A host of billionaires — sports team owners, oil barons, Wall Street traders and others — have managed to avoid paying it, ProPublica found. 
To study who was actually paying the new tax, ProPublica analyzed its trove of IRS data conta…]]></summary>

In states with abortion bans, ProPublica has found, pregnant women have bled to death, succumbed to fatal infections and wound up in morgues with what medical examiners recorded were “products of conception” still in their bodies.
These are the very kinds of cases state maternal mortality review committees are supposed to delve into, determining why they happened and how to stop them from happening again.
But panels in states that have recently imposed strict bans on abortion have done little to uncover whether the laws are contributing to maternal deaths…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently tried out an AI-driven tool called Cora Intelligence, and it’s been a game-changer for lead generation. Instead of working with a preloaded database or enriching a list of existing leads, it lets you input your industry and generates fresh leads tailored to your needs.
The standout feature is its AI-driven data customization—you can request specific details like product prices or summaries in plain language, and the tool retrieves the information for you. It even includes a chatbot where you can ask follow-up questions about any lead and get answers instantly, saving a ton of time on manual research.
Does anyone know of other tools that combine lead generation with AI-powered data enrichment and instant chat-based queries? I’d love to explore more options!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I created a web framework called kinekt and would like to introduce it to the community. Kinekt is a TypeScript-first, high-performance web framework built on web standards. It has the following features which set it apart from other frameworks in the javascript realm:
- It is 100% type safe. It supports the use of zod schemas to declare endpoints
- It has great DX. It auto-infers a client function for every endpoint you declare, making it extremely useful for developing full-stack web apps which are completely written in TypeScript
- It is highly modular. The middleware engine is unlike most other existing implementations and follows a functional-style paradigm
It is still in early development stages. Feedback is highly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I built this tool in a few hours because I needed a quick way to create profile pictures and email signature images. With Propic, you can upload a photo, remove the background, and replace it with a colorful round pill of your choice.
The background removal happens entirely client-side, so your photo never leaves your device. It’s fast, private, and easy to use.
You can find a link to the GitHub repo on the webpage.
Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions for improvements!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been working on this app for about half a year and am very excited to share it with you all!
How it works:
1. Connect with the tools your business uses (currently Slack or Gmail).
2. Create workflows by dragging and dropping nodes onto the canvas.
3. Listen to incoming events or trigger workflows manually.
Behind the scenes:
1. Each workflow runs as a durable, long-running execution.
2. AI agents within the same workflow share memory.
3. AI agents associate different channels, such as Slack threads or Gmail email threads, with workflows and can understand when replies are linked to specific workflow executions.
Try it out:
https://tryworkloop.com
There will be bugs!! But I’d really appreciate your feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gus Mueller:
This is a major update of Acorn, and is currently on a
time-limited sale for $19.99. It’s still a one time
purchase to use as long as you’d like, and as usual, the full
release notes are available. I want to highlight some of my
favorite things below.
“Select Subject”, “Mask Subject”, and “Remove Background” are new
commands which use machine learning (or A.I. if you prefer) to
find the most important parts of your image, and then perform
their respective operations. This has been a request for a long
time, and while I was doubtful of it’s utility, it’s actually
pretty fun to play with and more useful than I figured it would
be. So I’m glad I took the time to integrate it.
You can now set your measurement units to inches, centimeter, or
pixels, and it shows up across the tools for your image, not just
specific ones. This includes the crop palette, shape dimensions,
filter settings… well, pretty much everything. This might be the
oldest feature request I’ve implemented so far. And then related
to this, Acorn 8 now has an on canvas ruler which you can use to
measure out distances, straighten your image with, or even
redefine the DPI.
Look up Table (LUT) support. LUTs are pretty fun, and they work by
mapping one set of colors to another, enabling consistent or
stylized visual effects. LUTs are used primarily in photography or
filmmaking, and you can download and install new LUTs from various
places across the internet.
And more, so much more. The release notes are copious, and for me, always interesting. Acorn remains one of my most-used tools. It’s fast, reliable, powerful, extensible/scriptable, and the interface makes so much intuitive sense. That’s all been true since version 1.0 back in 2007, and that’s why it’s been my go-to image editor since it was in early beta before version 1.0 back in 2007. It’s just faster and more powerful today.
Acorn is, simply put, one of the best Mac apps ever made. It’s that good. You’re nuts (sorry) if you don’t check it out while it’s available for just $20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made this app for myself, but it's probably worth sharing.
When I tried to find a nice app that I could use to check air quality multiple times a day, I was shocked. All of them looked boring with traffic-light coding and overcrowded with unnecessary data. On top of that, they either contained ads or required payment.
I didn't want to use any of those apps every day, so I thought, "Well, how hard could it be?" and accepted the challenge. I expected to finish development in a month, but since I'm a designer and don't normally program apps, I had to learn Swift on the go. This required a month more than I expected.
In my designs, I'm usually way too focused on efficiency. Since this was my personal project, I wanted to experiment, so I didn't use standard controls or color coding.
Inspired by avant-garde style, I used forms and movement to convey air quality, as well as an asymmetrical layout and overflowing visualizations. I enjoy using the app, and I hope you will, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even before kickoff, the final of the NCAA men's soccer championship was special as a meeting between two underdogs. Marshall, which won its first title in the 2020 season as an unseeded team, was the 13th seed this year and reached the final by defeating the No. 1 Ohio State. Meanwhile, unseeded Vermont beat two-seed Pitt and three-seed Denver on its way to the title game. The Thundering Herd and Catamounts put together a real thriller Monday night, as Vermont won its first championship in program history on a sudden-death goal in overtime.
That goal is at the 7:56 mark of the highlight reel below, though the entire second half of the match was very dramatic. Marshall took a 1-0 lead in the 57th minute after Vermont keeper Niklas Herceg mishandled a tough cross right into the path of Tarik Pannholzer. Herceg kept his team in it with a beautiful save minutes later, and in the 81st minute, Marcell Papp took advantage of a poor clearance from Marshall keeper Aleksa Janjic to start and finish a one-two with a shot from just inside the box. You're here for the winner, though. In overtime, centerback Zach Barrett intercepted a pass in the Vermont half and smacked a speculative longball for Maximilian Kissel. The forward shrugged off his defender, then dribbled around Janjic and scored.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since 2018, Christmas—or rather, XXXmas—has made a provocative, year-round statement in an Oslo traffic circle. At its center stands a 20-foot-tall (6-meter) figure, simply called Santa—a creation that has become both a curiosity and a controversy.

The striking red bronze sculpture, created by Los Angeles artist Paul McCarthy, has earned nicknames like the “Dildo Gnome” and “Santa with Butt Plug” because the object Santa holds—a Christmas tree—bears a suggestive resemblance to a sex toy. With exaggerated features and provocative humor, it’s impossible to miss.

McCarthy frames his work as a critique of Western consumerism and the holiday season’s excesses, blending high and low culture with playful irreverence. He notes that an innocent Christmas icon can carry distinctly adult undertones: while it might simply be a Christmas tree, it could also resemble a butt plug—redefining it as abstract art.

Public opinion in Oslo is divided: some see the statue as a tacky distraction, while others embrace its absurdity as a quirky addition to the cityscape. Even far-right organizations have voiced their disapproval, arguing that it undermines traditional values, sparking debates about artistic expression and cultural identity.

Christian Ringnes, brewer heir and philanthropist, whose foundation funded the project, calls the statue a bold centerpiece for the area—an amusing, lively twist for an otherwise unremarkable spot. Ringnes admits he initially saw it as a jolly Santa Claus, only later recognizing its more provocative interpretations.

Oslo’s version, painted bright red and constructed from rough, horizontal slices, differs from the smooth, dark, unpainted original in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Planned for installation in 2001, the Dutch statue faced delays and was ultimately relocated a couple of times after intense backlash to its design.]]></summary>

A west-flowing river sounds like it should have been a highway for the westbound emigrants, and to some degree it was. It was not an artery like the great rivers of the east, however. It is blocked by waterfalls in its upper reaches (of which the lowermost is Shoshone Falls). Even below the falls, it runs through deep canyons, often punctuated by rapids. Exasperated trappers, in the words of trapper Wilson Price Hunt, called it the Mad River in the early 19th century.

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42444667</id>
        <link href="https://pypi.org/project/najaeda/"/>
        <updated>2024-12-17T19:56:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to introduce Naja EDA, a Python package designed to streamline post-synthesis Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows.
Naja EDA offers a robust framework that enables both software and hardware developers to efficiently navigate and manipulate electronic designs.
Key Features:
- Comprehensive Netlist Exploration:
  . Navigate netlist hierarchies with ease.

  . Access multiple levels of detail, including bit-level and bus-level granularity.

  . Explore instance-by-instance or utilize flattened views at the primitives level.

  . View per-instance connections or comprehensive equipotential networks.

  . Apply and manage design changes seamlessly.

  . Experiment with new EDA concepts using an intuitive API.

  . Build tailored tools to address specific challenges without relying on proprietary EDA software.

Simple example - print all instances in the design:
    def print_netlist(instance):
        for child_instance in instance.get_child_instances():
            print(f"{child_instance}:{child_instance.get_model_name()}")
            print_netlist(child_instance)

- https://pypi.org/project/najaeda/
- https://github.com/najaeda/naja
We would love to hear your feedback and learn more about how we can make naja EDA useful for software and hardware designers !
Looking forward to your thoughts!

From casual kickbacks to formal family dinners, here’s a playlist sure to please any crowd
 December belongs to the at-home entertainers. Early winter holidays and cooler weather offer myriad reasons to host events at home, from casual Christmas cookie swaps to intimate, cozy dinner parties. And one of the most fun, albeit daunting, tasks associated with hosting an event at home is organizing a playlist that sets the proper mood — especially when the genre is as polarizing as holiday music.
People have volatile reactions to holiday music; tearing up to a hymn at midnight mass, singing along to a classic, and excited gasps when a childhood tune unlocks a core memory. For everyone who thinks “Last Christmas” is a straight-u…]]></summary>

The best food trends of the year included cookbook clubs, conchas, and nonalcoholic cocktails
 To say it’s been a tumultuous year for many of us is perhaps an understatement. But when asked to survey the world of food and drinks over the last 12 months, it was easy to find some bright spots. These are the food trends that Eater staff were most grateful for in 2024, from small aesthetic pleasures to larger nostalgic comforts. 
Cookbook clubs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emma Chamberlain's most recent YouTube video opens with a montage of archival clips of her trying on outfits, shopping, and then purging her clothes over the years. Despite having, in her estimation, thousands of articles of clothing, Chamberlain says she was never satisfied. Instead, once she had accumulated what she decided were too many clothes, she would do a massive purge of her closet—only to fill it back up again. It's an interminable cycle: Buying a new thing is the answer to your emotional issue du jour, that is until you've unintentionally filled your home with too many things, at which point the only thing you can do to feel better is to purge. 
Once Chamberlain had ruthlessly evaluated each of the pieces in her closet, what she was left with, to her surprise, was a sort of capsule wardrobe, a deliberately small, curated collection of clothing intended to be worn interchangeably. That Chamberlain, uber-influencer and proprietor of a 12 million–follower YouTube channel, has gone capsule is indicative of the sustaining appeal of the concept, and I believe indicates an attempt to exert aesthetic control in a time of marked economic and social instability.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I built a CLI tool designed to streamline job hunting for software engineers. You can manage your job search more effectively by populating your professional connections and tracking companies of interest. Once set up, you can deploy it to a server to continuously scrape new job postings and share them directly to a Discord channel via free webhooks. This makes it easy to stay updated on relevant opportunities in real-time.
Why I made this?:
LinkedIn sucks, their email blasts are often spammy and filled with irrelevant listings. On top of that, if you’re relying solely on mainstream platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed, it’s nearly impossible to be first in line for a newly posted opportunity. It scrapes company job boards directly, ensuring you’re notified of opportunities the moment they go public.
Still making improvements everyday but you can give it a try using Homebrew (macOs) or install via Cargo (windows, linux). Appreciate any feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blackmagic Design:
Blackmagic Design announced it will start taking pre-orders for
the new Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive camera — the world’s first
commercial camera system designed to capture Apple Immersive Video
for Apple Vision Pro — today with deliveries due to start in
early 2025. DaVinci Resolve Studio will be updated to support
editing Apple Immersive Video early next year, offering
professional filmmakers a comprehensive workflow for producing
Apple Immersive Video for Apple Vision Pro. Apple Immersive Video
is a remarkable 180-degree media format that leverages
ultra-high-resolution immersive video and Spatial Audio to place
viewers in the center of the action. [...]
Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive features a fixed, custom lens
system pre-installed on the body, which is designed specifically
to capture Apple Immersive Video for Apple Vision Pro. The sensor
delivers 8160 × 7200 resolution per eye with pixel level
synchronization and an incredible 16 stops of dynamic range, so
cinematographers can shoot 90fps 3D immersive cinema content to a
single file. The custom lens system is designed for URSA Cine’s
large format image sensor with extremely accurate positional data
that’s read and stored at time of manufacturing. This immersive
lens projection data — which is calibrated and stored on device — then travels through post production in the Blackmagic RAW
file itself.
$30,000 — not cheap, but not crazy. And this isn’t merely 3D in a rectangular frame — it’s 180° 8K 3D.
David Smith:
What really intrigues me about it is when/if it will show up for
rental. I have a few tentative ideas in this space I’d love to
explore but I don’t think would justify the cost of owning one.
Looks like Lensrentals rents a vaguely similar, traditional
Blackmagic camera kit for around $1,000/week ... which would make
experimentation much more accessible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WindChime is a productivity app for families.  It allows you to send todos to each other and share relevant family contacts.  For example: the pediatrician, the plumber, or the address of your kids friends for dropoff and pickup.
Running a family takes coordination to figure out who is doing what and when.  WindChime is an app built to make that a little easier.
It automatically sends notifications when you make a task request, and you'll get a notification when the task is complete so you don't have to follow-up to find out if something is done.
Current contact and todo apps create information silos necessitating messaging contacts and task requests back and forth. WindChime reduces the friction of coordination by making the information available across everyone's phones (parents, childcare, kids).
Built by two dads who want great apps for their family life.

These are the food phenomena we’d like to bid adieu to in the coming year
 While 2024 saw many great things in the world of food and drinks — excellent new restaurants! An actually good season of Great British Bake Off! — there is much that the Eater staff would like to say goodbye to as we move into 2025. Some of these food and dining phenomena, from the benign annoyances to the potentially harmful, are perhaps more than mere trends. But, by naming them here we’re throwing our naive hope out into the universe that in the months to come they will please finally stop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started this project because I believe MCP has the potential to transform how AI models interact with external resources, but the ecosystem is still very fragmented. There's no central place to discover and compare all the server implementations available, which makes adoption and experimentation harder for developers.
I initially built the GitHub repo awesome-mcp-servers (https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers/), and it's been amazing to see the community contribute to it. Now, I'm taking it further with a directory that automates many tasks—introspecting servers to determine the tools, resources, and prompts they provide, inferring required configurations, and checking dependencies for vulnerabilities. These features are designed to make it easier for people to trust and use these servers in production environments.
While an open-source protocol is fantastic for innovation, I also think we need a centralized channel for addressing critical issues like security vulnerabilities, dependency management, and user support. My hope is that this directory not only grows with help from contributions, but also becomes a trusted resource for anyone entering the MCP space. If you're working on MCP servers or are interested in the project, I'd love to hear your thoughts!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN!
In a recent "Ask HN: What are you working on?" thread, I mentioned I was working on OCRing a large book:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41971614
The post generated some interest so I thought I would keep HN posted.
The book is Saint-Simon’s Memoirs -- an invaluable historical account of the French court under Louis XIV, full of wit, sharp observations, and of incredible literary value. I'm OCRing the edition of reference made between 1879-1930, that contains a lot of comments and footnotes: 45 volumes, ~27,000 pages.
Here's a link to a blog post that describes the techniques used so far (the project is still ongoing):
https://blog.medusis.com/38_Adventures+in+OCR.html
But you may also directly access the result here:
https://divers.medusis.net/boislisle/pub
This web app (not optimized for mobile, sorry) solves a tricky problem of preloading images efficiently. In short: preloading the next image isn't enough, since browsers will repaint if an image is moved, or scaled. Or browsers won't paint at all if visibility is hidden or opacity is zero, and will paint only when those values change. On an average, slow machine, this takes visible time. But if an image is simply behind another element, it will be painted, and the removal of the covering element or changing the z-index will not trigger a repaint.
(Preloading is important because it lets one review results fast; if one has to wait 150-200 ms between images it's simply discouraging).
Would love to hear feedback; happy to answer any question!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We built a way to go from requirements to a fully working admin panel/internal tool -type application within minutes. As a user you provide the various entities and their relationship plus any reports or dashboard widgets and it will generate it for you.
The problem with existing no code tools is that you still need to spend a lot of time building after figuring out what is needed (a problem of its own). Being able to focus on what is needed means you can build faster than designing, dragging, dropping, configuring.
What can you describe? Everything from tables, field types, relationships between tables and columns/fields, role-based access restrictions (RBAC), reports, dashboard metrics, bar/line/pie charts, lists.
This is made possible by fine-tuning Llama 3.1 to convert requirements into specs and code. Applications evolve over time and this means that the model has to be predictable between versions to ensure that the data/schema migrations can be generated cleanly, as well as provide any errors and warnings related to the requirements or data loss.
For non-developers this can be a huge time-saver since you don't have to use any additional developer resources. For developers it can be a great way to get 80+% of the way for complex apps (it's like super-scaffolding). Generated apps can be fully evaluated before purchase. A full git repo containing the back-end, front-end, migrations, etc. is the output of the entire process.
Currently the generated code base is TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next.js but the capability is there to generate different stacks because of the approach taken to not go directly to code when fine-tuning.
Brought to you by the team at Red Axle (https://redaxle.com)
Check out the video at https://youtu.be/rPppwB4jPlQ for a smaller app.
We look forward to your thoughts. Does building apps this way make sense for the super savvy HN crowd?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every data pipeline job I had to tackle required quite a few components to set up:
- One tool to ingest data
- Another one to transform it
- If you wanted to run Python, set up an orchestrator
- If you need to check the data,  a data quality tool
Let alone this being hard to set up and taking time, it is also pretty high-maintenance. I had to do a lot of infra work, and while this being billable hours for me I didn’t enjoy the work at all. For some parts of it, there were nice solutions like dbt, but in the end for an end-to-end workflow, it didn’t work. That’s why I decided to build an end-to-end solution that could take care of data ingestion, transformation, and Python stuff. Initially, it was just for our own usage, but in the end, we thought this could be a useful tool for everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So far, the person who killed United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson seems to have gotten what he wanted. It has been 13 days since Thompson was gunned down on a Manhattan street, and at this point the murder has been rather comfortably situated as an act of political violence. Authorities have charged a man named Luigi Mangione with the crime, and if a note he was carrying with him at the time of his arrest is to be believed, Thompson was killed as a response to the cruelty and depravity of the American healthcare industry, which has since become an urgent topic of conversation in American media and culture.
Evidence of the killer’s victory can be found on any news channel, or in any number of mainstream publications. There was a brief period of time when one could get away with dismissing the enthusiasm that swelled around Mangione’s alleged act as something that only existed in the unreality of the internet—the byproduct of a small, irony-poisoned segment of the country that best understands how to use social media as a megaphone. If that enthusiasm ever was contained, it has since escaped: SNL is now a safe place to joke about Thompson’s death, and respectable publications like The New Yorker and New York Magazine have acknowledged Mangione’s folk-hero status. The effectiveness of the killing can also be found in reactions from those in the government. New York Governor Kathy Hochul has convened a “safety summit” for New York CEOs, and Florida authorities charged a mother with making terroristic threats for saying “delay, deny, depose” (the words Mangione allegedly wrote on his shell casings) during a phone call with her insurance provider. Senator Elizabeth Warren evidently takes the groundswell of support for Mangione seriously enough to pander to those who sympathize with him. She recently went on TV to say, “Violence is never the answer … but you can only push people so far.”]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-12-17T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originating over a thousand years ago, the Nebuta Matsuri is a traditional summer festival held in several cities in Aomori Prefecture, most notably in Aomori City. Originally a lantern festival, Nebuta has since developed into a parade involving huge papier-mâché floats that mainly portray kabuki actors, mythological figures, and folk heroes.

Founded in 2011, the Nebuta Museum Wa Rasse exhibits such floats used in the most recent festival, celebrating this unique cultural event and archiving its history. The name was chosen as the winner of a public naming competition; rasse is based on rasse-ra, the typical heave-ho shout cried out by the float-haulers, while wa has several meanings in Japanese including "harmony" and "circle." Together, the name is also meant to evoke the word warai, or "laughter."

Located in the Aomori Waterfront area, the museum is only a short walk from the city’s central station. The building that houses the museum is an eye-catching sight, with red vertical louvers covering its exterior and giving its entrance a look like that of a steel curtain parting to welcome visitors.

The museum is a dark, spacious hall filled with colorful lights coming from the Nebuta floats, showcasing traditional artistry and folklore. The papier-mâché figures are astonishingly dynamic, with flowing hair and splashing water magically brought to life.]]></summary>

It also includes a bunch of flags to get exactly what you want in the format you want.
I got this idea as I was trying organize the large amount of local git repos I had. I also found it particularly useful when traveling since I use a different device. In these cases, it is really helpful to know which local git repos I forgot to push commits or have fallen behind the remote version.
Hope you find it really useful, let me know if you like it and also if you have any feedback for it!

Many sellers like me rely on DMs or clunky solutions, which can make managing sales and payments a headache. I wanted to simplify the process by turning my Instagram into a fully functioning storefront, quickly and effortlessly.
What CheckoutLink does: 
 Turn Instagram posts into shoppable links—sell directly through DMs or bio links. 
 Manage products, buyers, sales and payments from one simple dashboard.
 Sync your PayPal or Stripe account to get paid instantly. 
 Quick setup with no coding or website required.
I'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback or any suggestions you have to make CheckoutLink even better. Feel free to ask me anything!
Thank you so much for your support and I hope CheckoutLink can help you grow your business as well!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Historical fiction, as a genre, is not known for its laugh-out-loud, joke-a-minute qualities. But that's not to say there isn't space for humour, when the events of the past have so often been surreal, ironic, or downright disastrous. Toby Clements, whose new novel A Good Deliverance takes the form of a 15th-century prison confession, recommends five of the funniest historical novels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN! Agora is a search engine for e-commerce products. We've indexed 4 million products sold on 8,100 Shopify and WooCommerce stores and made them easy to purchase with a single cart transaction. Think of a decentralized Amazon.
I originally launched Agora as a side project here on HN to find a pair of red shoes for my wife last Christmas. I quickly realized that some of the best products on the internet are sold by small online stores that struggle to get the same visibility as large retailers. I started Agora on a mission to solve this problem. If you sell the best pair of red shoes in the world, customers should be able to find it.
We recently built a merchant dashboard that helps Shopify and WooCommerce merchants sell more on our search engine. Agora Merchants connects to your existing e-commerce store without any painful setup required and helps you track your store's performance on Agora. We don't take a commission of sales, orders are routed to your existing point of sale system, and inventory is automatically uploaded and refreshed. We do this with a combination of crawlers and AI agents.
So how is this different than Amazon? Both Amazon and Agora give network effects to stores (i.e. if you're searching for red shoes from one store, you may also want to buy a red dress sold by a different store). The key difference with Agora is that you continue selling on your existing e-commerce store, without having to manage inventory and payouts on another platform. This creates a magical experience for our merchants that saves them hundreds of hours. We believe in a future where merchants can sell however they want, we just bring them more customers.
I'd love your feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New Crispy Chicken Nuggets arrive at Taco Bell restaurants nationwide starting December 19, 2024 and will be joined by a trio of new spicy dipping sauces including Hidden Valley Fire Ranch Sauce.

A limited-time menu item, Taco Bell's Crispy Chicken Nuggets features white meat chicken bites marinated in "zesty jalapeno buttermilk flavor," breaded with a mix of breadcrumbs and tortilla chips, and then fried until crispy. It sounds like a chicken nugget version of the chain's previous tortilla-crusted chicken strips.
To accompany the new Crispy Chicken Nuggets, Taco Bell offers a trio of new sauces, including:


Hidden Valley Fire Ranch Sauce - Taco Bell’s first-ever ranch partnership offers a blend of Taco Bell's Fire Sauce and Hidden Valley Ranch.  
Bell Sauce -  "A familiar, rich, creamy, and tangy signature blend with subtle chili notes crafted with tomatoes, red chiles, and garlic." 
Jalapeno Honey Mustard - A sweet-heat sauce featuring honey mustard with a kick of jalapeno.  


Taco Bell's Crispy Chicken Nuggets are available a la carte in a 5-piece order with one dipping sauce for a suggested price of $3.99 and in a 10-piece order with two dipping sauce for $6.99.
You can also get them as part of a combo meal with regular Nacho Fries and a large fountain drink starting at $5.99 with 5 nuggets and $8.99 with 10 nuggets.
For more variety, there's the Crispy Chicken Nugget Deluxe Meal. It includes five nuggets, 1 dipping sauce, a Crunchy Taco, a Beef Chalupa, regular Nacho Fries, and a medium fountain drink starting at $10.49.

Baking my wedding cake helped me save money — and be really present as a bride
 Everything about my wedding fell into place, which was the only way I could have ever considered having one. We chose the venue because a friend was its beverage director and offered his help in setting it up. The day we got the wedding license, we met another friend for dinner and he let us know that he had officiated a friend’s wedding, so we asked if he’d oversee ours. I sent a photographer whose work I love an Instagram DM asking for her suggestions for someone who might want the gig, and to my great surprise, she offered to do it herself for a wildly under-market rate. The guest list was kept to 30 people because we only wanted our close family and dearest friends in attendance (…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At every event, tons of photos are taken, but they rarely get used well. As organizers, you post a handful on social media while the best moments are scattered across attendee phones. And if you’re hoping for engagement or visibility? It’s a grind.
We built Premagic, an event tool that flips this problem.
Here’s what we do:
Instant Photo Sharing: We use AI to auto-select the best event photos and share them in real time with attendees. They get photos they love. You get organic visibility when they share (and they do).
Branded Advocacy Posters: Personalized “I’m attending” or “I’m speaking” posters are generated automatically—no designer needed. Attendees become your event’s marketing army.
AI Avatar Check-Ins: We turn event check-ins into an experience. Attendees can generate personalized, branded avatars on the spot—fun, shareable, and sponsor-friendly.
We’ve tested this at over 2,000 events and seen a 3x increase in organic social reach for organizers. Event marketers and sponsors love it because it amplifies visibility without paid ads.
We’re event tech folks trying to make photos and moments work harder—organically.
Would love your feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers appear to have refreshed their mojo. It was never far gone, although consecutive home-and-away losses to the Atlanta Hawks confer a soupçon of illegitimacy so long as the Hawks remain the only team in the NBA to have lost twice to the abominable three-win Washington Wizards. The Cavaliers appear to have recovered from the wobble, and this is all normal basketball business in November and December, but it's enough to say that the team regressed after the best start in franchise history. That was inevitable. The questions had to do with how far their form would dip—are they as capable of excruciating lows as they are of rarified highs—and where precisely they'd sit in the league hierarchy once they'd settled.
That is possibly the most hedged and evasive basketblog lede ever written about a team with just four losses a third of the way through an NBA regular season. Part of that, I swear, is an effort to contain my own excitement about this Cavaliers team. I find them very easy to like, notwithstanding the few minutes every game that Donovan Mitchell spends waving his personal stamp around like a crazed mail clerk. Monday night they beat the absolute hell out of the Brooklyn Nets, recovering from a quick opening deficit with a vicious 16–0 run and then pouring it on, so that the final 39 minutes or so of a 48-minute contest were treated like an exhibition. Cleveland's scoring efficiency was downright unreasonable: The four starters not named Donovan Mitchell combined for 56 points and missed just five total shots and one free throw between them. Caris LeVert and Georges Niang drilled 8 of 14 three-point attempts off the bench. Without anyone even having a standout performance, the Cavs breezed to 130 points, and only Darius Garland kicking the ball around uncharacteristically and Sam Merrill forgetting how to shoot prevented them from sniffing 150.]]></summary>

This project validates cryptographic proofs and demonstrates how succinct, verifiable computations can be achieved.
Using Rust's powerful libraries like arkworks, I implemented pairing checks, public input commitments, and proof validation logic while ensuring the code remains modular and efficient.
I handled the complexities of affine group operations, scalar multiplications, and optimized public input verification to make this a practical ZK verifier.
Let me know what you think! Happy to answer questions about the design, challenges, or ZK cryptography in general.

between conservative color-blindness and liberal race-consciousness that had dominated
race politics since the 1960s. Instead of color blindness and meritocracy, the

advance white Christian nationalism. Liberals no longer settle for

For most of my life, I only knew matzo as one thing: a dry, somewhat flavorless cracker that always came in the same orange-and-white cardboard box. We ate it during holidays, but never really enjoyed it, and certainly it never occurred to me to eat matzo on purpose beyond the 10 days or so a year when it was mandated. But is it any surprise that matzo became yassified? The latest company to tackle the unleavened market is Matzo Project, a cute, bubbe-themed brand that makes matzo good enough for even goyim to snack on: Matzo Project. It makes the usual “flats” and also meal for ball making, but may I suggest unwrapping a bag of matzo chips?  Small, wafer-like crackers that come speckled with everything seasoning, cinnamon sugar, or just salt. They’re tasty and flavorful, but their key characteristic might be their hardiness, which makes them ideal for any thick dip.



No peeking! But check out what the Eater Advent Calendar has already revealed.  And check back each day for a new clutch condiment, gadget, or nibble that, yes, makes an amazing gift — but these surprises are just for you.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most of western Bulgaria is a moderate seismic risk zone, but it is also blessed with many hot springs. They vary in temperature and the healing mineral they naturally contain, and have been enjoyed ever since Roman times.

In Gorna Banya, the water has been revered for its healing nature for centuries. According to local folk tales, the waters had restored the once-abandoned village and healed a hunting dog from the valley of Sofia.

In 1922, a modern bathhouse with separate bathing areas and medical facilities was built, replacing an old Ottoman building. The ornate brick structure was designed in a late Vienna Secession style, with reinforced concrete domes and stone statues.

Public bathing culture started to decline in the 1960s as bathrooms became commonplace in new buildings, and collapsed further after the fall of the communist regime, as government subsidies for public baths dried out, leaving all but a few profitable structures closed and abandoned. The Gorna Banya bath house was no exception.

Today, the beautiful abandoned structure is a shadow of its former self. Yet contrary to most of its abandoned counterparts, it rarely falls completely silent. The water that once gave it life now flows freely right next to it, in a public fountain that attracts those who still seek the town's mineral-rich waters.]]></summary>

How acris.ai works:
1. Each step is an LLM prompt that you can chain together and execute. You can choose the type of a step: Text, JSON, Function Call, ReAct Agent, Vector DB etc.
2. Deploy it as a web application or JSON API
3. All free for now. Will implement usage based charging later
Feedback is welcome.

The tool is pretty simple:
- Drop an image or use example ones (apples, llamas)
- Hit detect
- Get visual bounding boxes + JSON output

The chain is coming for McDonald’s and Chick-fil-A, and the end result doesn’t feel totally Taco Bell
 As anyone who frequents Taco Bell knows, most of its menu is just assemblages of the same few gloops. There is the bean gloop, the cheese gloop (a personal favorite), and of course, the beef gloop. These are the essential, constituent elements of most items on the Taco Bell menu, guaranteeing that if you like the Beefy 5-layer Burrito you’ll probably also like the Mexican Pizza.
The chain’s newest addition, however, is decidedly not gloop. It is chicken nuggets, which hit stores nationwide later this week (for now, on a limited basis). With a thick, craggy coating and breast meat, the end result exists more…]]></summary>

Many of my conversations have some lasting value, e.g. for reference or as part of a larger project.  I've been around long enough to be distrustful of the long-term availability of anything online, so I want backups, and the best backups are useful ones (e.g. rath…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I always used to have disagreements with my designer because he wasn’t clear about what I wanted him to build. Then, when he built something, I would ask him to redesign it. He would tell me that if I had been clearer from the start, he wouldn’t have had to scrap his previous version. Let me know if this helps you as well ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN,
I built a leaderboard app to track rankings for my Catan group. It’s based on the Elo ranking system—the same system used in chess.
Everyone starts with 1100 points, and your score changes based on game results. Beating a stronger player earns you more points.
Turns out, the "elo" system isn’t just for chess. It works for any competitive game. We’re now using it for a variety of board games, and even for padel, and tennis.
Recently, I decided to open it up to the public.
You can give it a try — it’s free.
