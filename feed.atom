        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A second Bill Belichick interview has hit the morning-show circuit. On Friday's episode of ABC's Good Morning America, the North Carolina football coach returned to demonstrate that his disastrous CBS interview last month was an anomaly, and that he does know how to display emotion of a mildly jovial nature. The encore wasn't nearly as bad as his sitdown with Tony Dokoupil—this time, he wore a hole-free suit—but the results were still mixed.
On this occasion, NFL Hall of Famer Michael Strahan was asking the questions, which made for a more football-friendly environment. Once again the bulk of the conversation focused on Belichick's new book, but it was very funny to watch Strahan clearly signal to his guest that he would eventually address the 24-year-old girlfriend in the room. A couple of times in the nine-minute interview, Strahan references Belichick's "personal life."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At some level, reading some sort of purpose over or onto the ongoing vandalism of the American state is doing a favor to the vandals. Picture a parent holding a screaming toddler on a crowded bus, looking that toddler in the eye, and calmly asking that yowling little booger to explain himself. A tantrum is a tantrum, and it is the nature of things like that to be both unreasonable and unreasoning; in this case, the noisy and furious protagonist of the tantrum is, depending upon your perspective, either the single worst and dumbest member of one generation or the single richest person on earth. 
None of this is what you want, but it also just is what it is: incomplete and unreasonable people demonstrating the limits of their capacity to self-regulate in a way that makes everything worse for everyone else, without really offering the tantrum-author much beyond the satisfaction of turning all that un-understood inner chaos outward. You can't give a child melting down like that what they want, because they do not know what that is. And so thinking about it at all means that you are already thinking about it more than the person thrashing around at the center of it.]]></summary>

It is a hallowed occasion, where a smattering of European countries (and some oddballs, like Australia) gather to sing some of the most European songs you’ve ever heard. Some are very good, many are mediocre, and some are memorably strange. 
This year’s contest has been relatively free of controversy, especially compared to last year’s contest, where fan favorite “Europapa” by Joost (The Netherlands) was unexpectedly disqualified after the semifinals, and crowds of people outside the arena protested Israel’s participation in the contest. We’ll get to the countries, the songs, and the controversies soon, but first I wanted to ask all of the experts on this panel, what is your relationship to the Eurovision Song Contest? Longtime fan or first-time watcher?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The house style of the New York Times is severely outdated. Depending on the topic, the newspaper's purportedly impartial tone instead reads as smug, self-amused, and deeply lazy. The results are disastrous when applied to a recent article which sincerely considers the idea that Rachel Griffin-Accurso, the popular children's entertainer known as Ms. Rachel, might be financially compensated by Hamas.
Griffin-Accurso's grave sin is that she wants Israel to stop starving and killing Palestinian children in Gaza. For this, she has become the target of a pro-Israel contingent so committed to suppressing any support for Palestine that they have abandoned basic human dignity. Griffin-Accurso has spoken out on the crisis for a while on her Instagram page, and in the past week, she posted a number of statements that promote organizations which aid children suffering from violence and hunger, including malnutrition in Gaza and famine in Sudan.]]></summary>

The box score doesn't tell the story, nor do the highlights, save for one little easter egg. 
Late in the second quarter, Julius Randle nailed a three from the top of the key to give his team the double-digit lead they would hold onto until the game was well in hand. Randle sashayed back on defense with the ease of a man who is assured of his good fortune, hands flapping, beyond comfortable. The broadcast then cut to a shot of Steph Curry, who appeared in a daze, staring unfocused through the court with his lips parted, shaking his head in disbelief. His season, another great year even by his standards, one of the last ones he might ever have, was over. The NBA's greatest basketball comedian couldn't do anything but watch the grim drama wind to its concluding act.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pimlico Race Course, the second-oldest racetrack in the country, will close after Saturday’s 150th running of the Preakness Stakes. Last week, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore signed off on a plan to demolish the Baltimore track beginning this spring. That's the first step in what’s being billed as a two-year, $400 million publicly funded project to rebuild the historic but decayed racing compound.
I worked at Pimlico for several years in the late 1990s while covering Maryland racing. The track has been hosting thoroughbreds and taking wagers since 1870 (only Saratoga has been around longer), and its allegedly imminent demise was an evergreen story the whole time I worked there, and ever since. The place was a dump with charm in my day. Now, it’s just a dump. A couple days after Gov. Moore signed the demolition order, I went to opening day of Pimlico’s 2025 spring meet and saw the plight first-hand. The main elevator in the clubhouse broke a few years ago and never got fixed. The track operators put up a rickety looking construction lift in the back parking lot at some point, but that was out of commission, also. The only way to get to the press box, my old hangout located on top of the grandstand, was to walk up several flights of stairs in a decrepit stairwell, where the floors at every level were severely water damaged.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gareth Evans is the patron saint of people getting their shit wrecked. In films like Merantau, Apostle, and The Raid diptych, people get chopped by machetes, whacked with broom handles, tossed through floors, kicked into toilets, cracked across concrete tables, and fried on open griddles. His fights are geographic, tracking large numbers of combatants as they fight up, across, and through confined spaces, taking care to note landmarks—windows, doorframes, loose hangnails, and glass-fronted cabinets—before working them into the flow of violence. At his best, his fight scenes marry the chaos of a street brawl with the control of a martial arts tournament match, cranking up the energy without ever losing clarity.
Havoc, his latest Netflix release, has two spectacular brawls: the first in a crowded nightclub, the second in a remote lakeshore cabin. Spanning much of the film’s second half, these fights find Walker (Tom Hardy) fending off corrupt cops and huge crowds of Triad goons—he must leave at least a hundred people dead, wasted by shotgun blasts, hatchet blows, and, in one particularly nasty kill, pierced through the neck by a spear gun. It’s spectacular stuff, visceral and inventive, and infinitely more exciting than any of the John Wick clones that Havoc superficially resembles.]]></summary>

But it turns out there was a better way to alleviate the unending boredom of Mitchell.
The movie, in which Baker plays the slobbish cop who gives the film its name, is shown in one of the funniest episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000. In Joel Hodgson’s last episode, he and the bots absolutely ravage Mitchell star Joe Don Baker. They mock his weight.

Every time I am grumpy and miserable and depressed but still drag my ass off the couch and to the gym, I am filled with annoyance after I'm done. Why does picking up a few heavy things and setting them back down make me feel so much better? Why can't I be rewarded for simply lying down on my couch and watching television? Why do brains work like this? What is the point in having a body?
These questions haunt me, so I was thrilled to read Casey Johnston's new book A Physical Education: How I Escaped Diet Culture and Gained the Power of Lifting. Johnston is a beloved writer for the swole community. She has written about lifting weights for almost a decade, founded a program for people trying to learn how to lift, and now has written the book on why it all matters. She encouraged me almost five years ago to begin lifting, and it quickly became the only form of exercise that did not make me so miserable I wanted to quit it immediately.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the first 20 or so minutes of The Picture Of Dorian Gray, the Broadway adaptation of the Oscar Wilde novel as a one-woman show starring Sarah Snook, the production asks a genuinely disturbing question: "What if you were watching TV, instead?" At the top of the hour, Snook enters the stage without fanfare, surrounded by crew members—really, they should be considered performers, too—who will spend the next two hours filming her with compact cameras. She takes a seat behind the gigantic vertical screen in the middle of the stage, looks into a lens, and speaks to the audience two-dimensionally.
What follows is a by-heart reading of the start of the book—I'm pretty sure, at least, because I've never read it. Snook does the narration and the dialogue, and then the scope expands, but only sort of. Soon, Snook is costumed as Dorian—one of many characters she plays—and moves around the stage giving, basically, just that performance, as the young man poses for and then desperately admires a painting of himself. Filling out the show is prerecorded work: other Snook performances superimposed on screen or piped in as audio. In a dinner party sequence, for example, she performs live as Lord Henry while portraying the guests—all with their own elaborate costumes and ways of speaking—on the Broadway Jumbotron. In an adaptation of a story about vanity, the actress is playing with nobody but larger-than-life versions of herself.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Would you be into watching a 100-minute I Think You Should Leave sketch? Because that’s basically what Friendship is—a Tim Robinson sketch stretched out way past its welcome. Robinson stars as Craig Waterman, that familiar everyman that Robinson is so good at portraying, a middle-of-the-road dude in literal beige who basically becomes undone by his own squareness. The guest star in this one is Paul Rudd, as hammy as ever as Austin Carmichael, the cheesy-unless-you-don't-know-what's-cheesy weatherman with the hidden hairpiece, the loud band, and the cowboy-kerchief attitude. The premise? Craig seems incapable of making friends while everyone around him—from the jerks at work who can't stop talking about the new Marvel movie he hasn't seen yet, to his wife (straight woman Kate Mara) and son …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am, as a general rule, resistant to blaming a losing team for some sort of moral failing: bowing under pressure or not caring enough or whatever. Largely this is because it ignores the performance of the winning team, and most of the time sports really are as simple as one team playing better than the other. So it is with the skeptic's eye (but still the hater's temptation) that I find myself loath to credit the Maple Leafs' ongoing collapse, from up 2-0 on the Panthers to down 3-2 after a 6-1 shellacking Wednesday night, to some sort of inherent Leafiness. Do I really believe that the tension is too much for successful pro athletes like Auston Matthews, still goalless in the series? Is the second round that much more stressful than the first, in which they seemed fine? Would the most competitive people on Earth really lay a Game 5 stinker because they just happened to not feel like giving full effort that day?
That is for Canadian sports media to discuss all summer, and they will, and it will get very stupid. But I do find my stony resolve cracking a bit when I see what the Leafs themselves had to say about a game in which they allowed six unanswered. "We all need to be better, me included," head coach Craig Berube said.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo is real good at getting ejected from a baseball game. A fellow ought to get his dang money's worth; there are too many managers out there—sleepy, retiring types, or the constitutionally frail—who do not or cannot make a truly cinematic moment out of an argument. Fans and players alike appreciate a manager who kicks huge ass. At least one Washington National, for example, is reportedly chafing at the recent passivity of the team's cardiovascularly challenged head guy. Lovullo will not leave his men wanting: When he marches out there, odds are someone is going to take a reaming for the ages. 
And Lovullo, God bless him, doesn't need much of an invitation. Only seven active managers have been tossed more; Lovullo, in his ninth season as a manager, is already in the top-100 all-time, with 22 career ejections. By way of comparison, it took Hall-of-Famer Hughie Jennings 16 seasons to get to 24. Lovullo may not have Bobby Cox's prodigious, historic pace—a fantastic 162 career ejections in 30 seasons—but then this is a different era. As broken down in a 2019 New York Times story, the manager meltdown is considered somewhat déclassé in the modern game. "I tell [today's umpires], 'You guys are lucky you weren’t around 20, 30 years ago," says Reds manager Terry Francona, who has been run just 51 times in 23-plus major-league seasons. Giving a volcanic helping of The Business to those antagonists in the blue shirts was, in earlier times, considered an important part of the job, not just to address umpire performance but to inspire one's own team out of mid-summer ennui.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Natalie Nakase is many things: a 5-foot-2 former walk-on who became the starting point guard for UCLA, a WNBA champion as an assistant coach with the Las Vegas Aces, and “a unifier,” as Golden State Valkyries general manager Ohemaa Nyanin put it in an introductory presser last October. When the Valkyries play their season opener in San Francisco this Friday, Nakase will add to that list, becoming the first head coach of the franchise, and the first Asian-American head coach in WNBA history. She is a third-generation Japanese American from Southern California, raised by a basketball-loving father who kept his daughters in the gym the way some parents bring their children to church.
Basketball has been an integral part of Japanese-American communities on the West Coast since the early 1900s. Shaped by forcible internment during World War II, Japanese-American basketball leagues (colloquially known as the “JA leagues”) flourished for decades as a way to cultivate second- and third-generation talent, and still operate to this day. The use of digital archives dating back to the 1940s, as well as interviews with relatives and members of the JA league community, can demonstrate how the story of Natalie Nakase is the story of Japanese-American basketball. Go through her family history, and you’ll find competition and resilience that transcends the sport itself.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After his Oklahoma City Thunder finished up a spectacular Game 5 win against the Denver Nuggets, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander fielded a question about the game's best player: Nikola Jokic. The reigning MVP put together a near-perfect game against the presumptive MVP's team, with 44 points on 25 shots, 15 rebounds, and five assists that could have been thrice as many if any single one of his teammates could have hit one single shot after halftime. "It's a team sport," Gilgeous-Alexander said. "No one guy can do it." In what was comfortably the best game of the whole second round, and close to the best game of the 2025 NBA playoffs, one guy very nearly did it. That he could not answers some pretty important questions.
Jokic had not had a good series before Game 5. Apart from his Game 1 masterclass, Oklahoma City has been defending the hell out him, keeping Isaiah Hartenstein glued to his right shoulder while sending their ballhawking wings down to swipe at the ball and deny him the easiest pressure-release passes. He had 21 made field goals and 16 turnovers in the middle three games of this series, often looking flustered by all the pressure.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most years, Patricia Gibson decorates her home for Memorial Day—putting up a sign or placing some flags in her flower pots. But this year, when she saw decorations in the store, she paused in the aisle. "Should I decorate some red, white, and blue for outside?" Gibson remembered asking herself. "And I'm just like, no. I'm really not feeling the miracle right now, and who's representing it." Because in February, after working for the federal government for 17 years, Gibson learned that she would lose her job as a contract specialist at the Office of Personnel Management, through no fault of her own.
OPM, essentially the federal government's human resources agency, has historically flown under the radar of the general public. But this winter, Elon Musk and DOGE functionally took over the agency to carry out their campaign of mass firings. As CNN reported in March, OPM employees who previously sent communications to federal agencies watched from the sidelines as Musk's OPM sent a barrage of termination notices to federal employees. One such notice was the "Fork in the Road" email, which offered workers a chance to be paid through September if they left their posts—an attempt to downsize the federal workforce and remove anyone resistant to Trump's agenda.]]></summary>

After the two filled their collective diaper in front of CBS cameras, Pablo Torre’s podcast reported that the University of North Carolina had banned Hudson from its football team’s facilities (which the school denied in a statement that I can poke more holes in that Belichick's formalwear). Then the Washington Post published a letter from Hudson resigning from her cheerleading gym, and the paper informed all of us that Hudson’s mother runs a “popular sex boutique” in Provincetown, Mass. Oh, and Hudson finished third in the Miss Maine USA pageant. A nation wept.
Now that’s a lot of information to take in. I’m so wrapped up in the story of Jordon Hudson—our heroine used to give henna tattoos to customers in Provincetown while wearing her regional beauty pageant sash—that I nearly forgot about the football part of this story. Lucky for you and me, Tar Heels GM Mike Lombardi has entered the chat room to remind us that actual work of assembling a winning football team in Chapel Hill isn't going so well, either:]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is our second blog this week about Javy Báez, because the Detroit center fielder (yes, center fielder!) has simply demanded it. There are players in MLB who can boast a higher WAR or more home runs, but nobody in baseball has surprised like Báez through his first 34 games. Once one of the sport's most exciting young talents with the Cubs, then an absolute washout who OPSed below .600 in back-to-back years, a humbled Báez returned from season-ending surgery last August to a growing team that had unexpectedly fashioned itself into a contender. But rather than be an awkward appendix on a roster that seemingly proved it was better off without him, Báez has pieced himself back together. Now, he's a leading hitter on—I swear this is real—Baseball Reference's World Series favorite. And Tuesday night's performance against the Red Sox was his most endearing yet in a Tigers uniform.
With some wet weather in Detroit and a Tarik Skubal start scheduled for the next day, it wasn't a big crowd that witnessed Javy's heroics live. But Michigan is following the Tigers more closely than it has in any spring for the past decade, and I could feel the reverberations from a thrilling 11th inning all the way out in Brooklyn, where I listened to Dan Dickerson on the radio call during my walk home. It was Javy who was responsible for extras in the first place, scoring from third on a botched pickoff from the Boston catcher early on and then clobbering a breaking ball to left for a three-run shot in the sixth.]]></summary>

Marc Márquez, one point behind in second place, suffers from the elder child's plight of being shorter than his younger brother. Álex Márquez, the championship leader, suffers from the younger child’s plight of having an older brother who is considered by many to be the greatest of all time in their sport. You know how it is.
They have been on the same team twice. The first time was in 2020. Before that, between 2013 and 2019, Marc Márquez cemented the end of the Valentino Rossi dynasty. He became the youngest major champion in motorcyclesport, and then won five more championships on the back of his remarkably aggressive style. In his obscene 2019 season, he had one retirement, and otherwise finished top-two in every single race of the year. He accomplished all this without much help from his machinery: The Honda was broadly considered far from the best bike on the grid at the time. Like a lot of greats, Marc Márquez is either loved or resented, though the latter is no knock on his public demeanor. He is noticeably smiley. The same wide, full-faced grin has stayed with him from then, into 2020, and onto now.]]></summary>

I never feel like having three monitors is more useful than when I can play the game on my main one and have a guide on a secondary screen. The reason I do this is simple: I like thoroughness in my gaming. I don't want to miss the secretly overpowered item in Act I because I didn't know where it was. I want to see it all, even if that means being guided by the hand.
Imagine my shock, then, over how I played Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the ridiculously named role-playing game by French studio Sandfall Interactive that became one of the best reviewed games of all time shortly after its release on April 24. I had not heard of Clair Obscur before the reviews and hype started rolling in, and I immediately bought and downloaded it. A turn-based RPG that is both gorgeous and almost hilariously French? With timing-based parries and dodges, like some form of modernized, Francophile Super Mario RPG? Yes, please.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unless you're a fan of one of the big clubs that needed a late Nottingham Forest collapse to help mask your own team's piss-poor season (we're looking at you, Man City and Chelsea), you have to feel for the Trees. Forest maintained its over-performing underdog act for so long and so admirably this year, and it was just starting to look like the team might avoid the Icarian fate that usually befalls the (relatively) low-spending high fliers of any given Premier League season. Alas, with Sunday's 2-2 draw against Leicester City, it appears that the wax is running, the feathers are falling out, and Forest has entered what could be a tailspin.
No one could really say it's surprising that the Tricky Trees have fallen off the pace that had them soaring in the Champions League places. Over the course of 38 matches, it's hard for the talent of the big boys, the health of your overachievers, and the god of regression not to eventually catch up with even the most brave and resilient upstarts. In Forest's case, rivals like Man City, Newcastle United, and Chelsea have started to hit some better form entering the final stretch, key Reds like Callum Hudson-Odoi and Murillo have picked up untimely injuries, and Chris Wood, the big galoot who could not stop scoring goals (he has 20), has more or less stopped scoring goals (two in his last nine games). As such, the Trees have picked up just five points from their last six matches, which has seen them drop from a comfortable third place down to seventh.]]></summary>

Nowadays being a fan of the Wizards means hoping they will lose—they trained me for this, by trying hard for six months to lose as much as possible—and I'll be damned if I can switch off that impulse in time for the draft lottery. Unto the Wizards I say: Ha ha! Screwed by fate, but not a cruel one: A just and righteous fate, a Rod Serling-ish fate rather than a Stephen King-ish one. Also screwed by the universe: the Utah Jazz and the Charlotte Hornets, fellow practitioners of the Vomit Arts. Owned to hell, all of you! Ha ha!
Still this morning I would like to ram my head into one of those industrial rock smashers, because of who won the lottery. The son-of-a-gun Dallas Mavericks—those selfsame bozos who just torched their future, proudly and defiantly, for a foundation of two unreliable and rapidly eroding veteran stars—jumped an incredible 10 spots and won the top overall pick in the 2025 draft. Their odds of winning were less than two freakin' percent. A third of the damn league had better odds of landing that pick; a solid seven of those teams might even have been able to say they deserved a friendly turn from the cosmos. Instead, fortune smiled down on the asshole Mavericks, to my mind the very most odious option of all. Screw.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO —The NBA playoffs have been going for nearly a month and everyone is suffering. Jayson Tatum awaits an MRI on a Monday night leg injury that may well have ended his playoffs and Boston's title repeat hopes; Damian Lillard's Bucks career ended with an Achilles tear; and Steph Curry is down with a strained hamstring. The headlining injuries hardly even tell the story. The eight teams still in contention look battered and out of gas: The Nuggets just scored eight points in a first quarter, the Celtics whimpered and died in two straight fourth quarters, and the ailing Cavaliers were just ground into a fine powder by the Pacers. Things are going to get worse, as we're not even halfway through the playoffs. It is hard to shake the feeling, especially after the Tatum injury, that the eventual champion will not necessarily be the best team but the least damaged. Which brings us to the word of the playoffs: physicality.
Throughout this NBA postseason, players and coaches cannot stop talking about physicality, and the necessity of meeting it. "I think the physicality was there," Magic coach Jamahl Moseley said after his team lost Game 2 against the Celtics. "I don't think they were dirty plays, but I think it passed a line of physicality," Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said after his team lost Game 1 to the Pacers. "Our physicality was great tonight," Jaylen Brown said after taking a 3-1 lead against the Magic. "If you look around the playoffs right now, it’s super physical," Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said in the first round of his team's series against the Lakers. "To me, they’ve gone way too far on the physicality. [...] It feels like it’s physicality without purpose." After his team lost Game 3 against the Clippers, Nuggets coach David Adelman provided the diagnosis: "Defensively, we have to meet their physicality."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The whole season, win or lose, Montreal Victoire head coach Kori Cheverie and her players spouted their belief in the team. Listening to them week after week, the message started to feel tired. How sincerely can you focus on the good things after you lose? When goalie Ann-Renée Desbiens got hurt, then Kati Tabin got served a multi-game suspension, it was hard to picture this as a team that could sustain their early-season dominance. In March and April, the Victoire lost as much as they won. Come playoffs, would they show up and win games, or would they bow out suddenly and gracelessly like last year? But it really was true that every single player talked about the team’s confidence, every game. What comes first: the belief or the act of professing it? For the Victoire, maybe it doesn’t matter.
In Game 1, Montreal suffered from a serious case of playoff nerves. Silly mistakes saw pucks slip through Ottawa’s crease unanswered, and Montreal never led. Both the Victoire’s goals came off of power plays—a good showing for their special teams—but they couldn’t figure out how to score without l’avantage numérique. Despite outshooting Ottawa, they did what they’d always done in the playoffs: lose.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soon after Javier Báez signed a six-year, $140 million contract with the Detroit Tigers, he began the least productive stretch of his MLB career, and I began my new life as the world’s No. 1 Javy Báez apologist. Javy hatred, I thought, was the sign of a dull mind. It linked everything I resented in my fellow Tigers fans: their sourness; their temper; their archaic obsession with “errors”; their belief in a baseball value system that didn’t resemble mine and could never account for the singularity of Javy. It bothered me when the complaints tipped into falsehoods, the insistence that Javy was “lazy,” that he’d gotten his bag in 2022 and then stopped trying.
Of course, I was watching the games and seeing what everyone else saw. Báez's power numbers fell to such lows that the rare home runs he did hit were kind of funny. His on-base percentages had always skewed low—the cost of a free-swinging approach—but three seasons into the contract, they were dire. In 2024, he slashed .181/.221/.294. The less he got on base, the sillier I felt defending him on the grounds of his “baserunning genius.” Like a Joe Biden aide, I had a job to do, and I would do it, but privately, I knew he was cooked.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My gargantuan senator is throwing a hissy fit. According to reporting by the Associated Press, Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman attended a meeting last week with representatives for a teachers union, at which Fetterman says that they "had a spirited conversation about our collective frustration with the Trump administration’s cuts to our education system." The other people in the meeting say that the Senator started repeating himself and shouting. They say he was yelling, "Why does everyone hate me, what did I ever do?" and "Why is everybody mad at me?" A member of Fetterman's staff ended the meeting, ushered the visitors into the hallway, and then broke down crying and had to be comforted by the teachers.
This is toddler behavior. Why does everyone hate me? What did I ever do? Why is everyone mad at me? Sir! You are 6-foot-8 and a Senator for a purple state. By the nature of your job, something like 50 percent of the people in your own state will hate you at all times, and that's not including the people in your own party who also don't like you. Being an elected public servant is not a long red-carpet strut where everyone treats you like a pop star and bows to you and asks who you're wearing. Power is a responsibility, and with it comes the reality that not everyone is going to like you.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There has been a spirited race toward Major League Baseball's Dumpster of Distinction all season, with a number of candidates trying to join the increasingly popular 100-loss club. But there are ways to fail, and then there are stylish ways to fail. Miami and Baltimore are failing, but it's pretty boilerplate stuff—the Marlins don't pitch, the Orioles don't hit. Nothing especially novel there, give or take Baltimore's 192 wins over the previous two seasons.
In other words, in an era in which losing 100 is no big thang—there have been 22 teams that have managed it since 2018—the way you get to 100 matters. The Chicago White Sox figured that out last year by reaching 100 in the last week of August and ending up with 121 losses, the second most defeats in baseball history. They stunk, but they found a way to do it at a rate that no other team had figured out before.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These playoff have had everything, from unlikely comebacks to huge upsets to bloody feuds to preternatural feats of athleticism. You can keep all that. We true connoisseurs of professional sports controversies have been craving a rulebook kerfuffle, and in Sunday's Stars home win over the Jets, we finally got one. This is why they play the game; it's time for some lawyerpuck.
The third-period, tie-breaking goal in an eventual 5-2 Dallas win was credited to Alex Petrovic, but that doesn't come close to telling the story. Petrovic, skating past the side of the net, tried to gather a rebound and directed it with his left skate into the crease. It appeared that untouched it would have slid harmlessly through the crease, but Connor Hellebuyck, trying to clear the puck, angled it into his own net. Goal? After eight minutes of video review, and no doubt the frantic flipping of rulebook pages in the NHL's Situation Room: Goal.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rafael Devers did what his bosses wanted. The Red Sox went out and grabbed a big-time addition over the winter, but to maximize their investment they needed Devers to shift away from his preferred position—the one he's been playing his entire career, and the one the Red Sox extended him a nine-figure contract to continue playing off into the future. Devers wasn't happy about the request and resisted for a while. He eventually caved, and then he endured an embarrassing, historically awful start to the season while adjusting to this new deal. But he's recovered admirably and been a reliable and productive contributor for a fun and competitive Red Sox team.
Now the team is at it again. First baseman Triston Casas, off to a hateful, miserable start of his own, nuked his left knee while trying to beat out an infield single on May 2 and has been lost for the year. The Red Sox have since tried out Romy Gonzalez, Abraham Toro, and Nick Sogard over at first, with results that you would call broadly lousy—7-for-26 at the plate with zero extra-base hits—were it not for the fact that Casas was producing an OPS+ of [awful retching noises]. It's not that these are especially terrible baseball players—although scanning Toro's Baseball Reference page is causing an alarming intensification of the retching—but certainly none of those poor bozos is the sort of guy a team is eager to get into the lineup, least of all a team with semi-credible playoff aspirations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It didn't matter that the Oilers jumped out to a 2–0 lead in Game 3. It didn't matter that Stuart Skinner, forced back into action after Calvin Pickard's injury, allowed fewer goals than he did in his two catastrophic starts against the Kings. And it didn't matter that, with the score 3–2 Vegas in the final few minutes, Connor McDavid unlocked the Golden Knights' defense with a little pass from the corner that went in off an enemy skate. All anyone's going to remember from Saturday night is the very last second, which is how Vegas managed to cut into Edmonton's 2–0 series lead.
Any reasonable person would have been ready for overtime as William Karlsson broke into the offensive zone and took the puck behind the net with under five seconds to play. But in retrospect, when the VGK original sent the puck flying backward into the slot for another one of his expansion-season brethren, Reilly Smith, neither man had yet given up on the third period, and there was still enough time to inflict the knockout blow. Smith, using nearly every tenth of a second allotted to him, zoomed past a diving Oilers defender and tried to round a sliding Skinner as he fired a shot in the direction of the crease. The puck bounced so quickly that in real time, the closest official didn't see a goal. But replay review revealed the buzzer-beater, and worse, the person most responsible for it crossing the line.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks have played 149 minutes across three games of their second-round playoff series. The Celtics—the higher seeded team and the defending NBA champions—have led outright for about 128 minutes of that time, and the teams have spent about another 11 minutes tied, meaning the Knicks have led in this series for a little over 10 total minutes. The Celtics have gained leads of at least 20 points in each game, while the Knicks have never led by double digits; they have, in fact, never once had a three-possession lead. This isn't a real metric, I may have just made it up while I sat here, but: If you total together New York's maximum lead from each of the three games, and then multiply the sum by the total minutes they've spent in the lead, you get 90. If you do the same for the Celtics—20 points in Game 1, another 20 in Game 2, 31 points in Game 3, added together and then multiplied by total time in the lead—you get 9,088.
This is very dumb, meaningless math, but for some weird reason I have always been tickled by one number being way huger than another number. The Knicks have 90 units of advantage through three games, against Boston's 9,088: Wow! And also: Ha! By my dumb metric, it would be absolutely ludicrous to guess that the team holding the overall lead in the series today is the New York Knicks. But here we are! Boston needed a win Saturday to avoid falling into a 3–0 hole in a matchup that they have otherwise absolutely dominated.]]></summary>

Something about that image made stark the irresolvable paradox of this 17-year-old and his staggeringly advanced game. Part of it was the akimbo posture, accentuating the youthfulness of his sinewy limbs, which, unlike when the ball is at his feet, made him look every bit the callow teen he is. Part of it was the emotional tenor of the moment, the blessed, childlike state into which sports can transport anyone—child or adult, on-pitch participant or TV viewer from thousands of miles away—where the result of a silly little game can send hot tears of anguish streaming down millions of faces.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In college, I briefly and unsuccessfully raced bikes, a humbling experience that taught me that the dog in me was not of requisite size to hang with anyone who wasn't a middling amateur. Every part of racing was a drain, from being nervously sardine-packed alongside dozens of other gangly 20-year-olds to figuring out when to burn energy and when to chill in the pack so that I actually had energy to burn. I never won anything or even came close, though loving bike racing means loving the draining stuff. That's all you can count on.
This is the right way to think about professional cycling, and really any form of racing. Think about this sort of competitive framework seriously enough, and you rub up against the limits of describing or thinking about racing in cold, analytical language. Easy and forgivable as it is to roll one's eyes at a conception of bike racing rooted in romantic notions like bravery, or the virtues of suffering with dignity, those do form the competitive substrate of the sport. Like most racing sports, cycling is foremost a pain tolerance contest. Strategic thinking is centered on how to trick other people into suffering more than you. How could you not think about guts, in both usages?]]></summary>

Then, on a Saturday evening in early April, she all at once flipped out at our other dog, Grover, when he came up behind her: Snarling and snapping, fighting as though for her life.

But this week, his computer was bogged down and wouldn’t load said slides. Jasper offhandedly remarked that he was paying the price for not having restarted his computer for a couple weeks, and I similarly offhandedly implored everyone to restart their computers once a day, if not more. Immediately a horde of my coworkers began clowning my adherence to good computer hygiene, and even more so when I mentioned that I have been known to restart my computer four or five times a day.
Here’s the thing: I am right and they are wrong. There is no reason to not shut down your computer, at the very least, at the end of the day, and boot it up fresh the next morning. Their qualms were easily batted away. Oh no, what about my tabs?!?! Every browser now has the ability to restore your last session, so you can get your stinkin’ tabs back that way. (Side note: Excessive tabs are an argument for another day.) Who cares if it runs a little slow, I don’t need my computer’s full processing power and memory to write a post. It’s much nicer when you can flit around the internet at lightning speed without your browser slowing to a crawl. You are a slave to the machines. Fine, but my machine at least runs reliably and with great speed.]]></summary>

We all know what happened in Game 2, and we are pleased to report that Pierce seems to have actually followed through on his promise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Righteous Gemstones' final episode aired on Sunday, closing another chapter in what has been a 16-year project by comedian-writer-creator Danny McBride and his co-creators/friends from college, Jody Hill and David Gordon Green, to tell the stories of life in the South and the fantasies of American exceptionalism. The stories of career charlatans, egomaniacal has-beens, greedy televangelists, drug-addicted hustlers, hard-living gamblers, and human volcanoes ready to burst; the kinds of people who inspire Warren Zevon or Townes Van Zandt songs. No one has captured 21st-century America with more specificity, showing the comical obsessions—with hypermasculinity and accumulation—that always threaten to destroy us.
In 2009, McBride teamed up with his friends and collaborators from the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, namely Hill, Green, and Ben Best, to create Eastbound & Down. McBride played Kenny Powers, a John Rocker-meets-Jose Canseco type of baseball superstar at the worst point in his life. All of his money and success and chances to play had burned out, reducing him to moving in with his brother Dustin (John Hawkes) and filling in as a substitute PE teacher at the elementary school where his former love April (Katy Mixon) works. Eastbound proved that McBride and his team could take what might have been a silly sitcom and elevate it to a novelistic character study of man in a spiritual battle between his worst impulses and his desires for change and human connection. It was an instant hit.]]></summary>

Four Edmonton goals, and none involved Leon Draisaitl or Connor McDavid? Not even a single measly assist? That can't be right. But it was true: For 75 minutes, including that ensuing overtime, Vegas clamped down on the Oilers' superlative-scoring duo, keeping them off the board and mostly away from any serious threats. They needed to do it for 76.
There was a lot to like about the game the Knights played, which makes the 5-4 result that much more painful. They made life miserable for Calvin Pickard, scoring four goals for the first time since Game 4 of the Wild series. They capitalized on two of their five power plays, Victor Olofsson scoring both times. Their kill was flawless, especially on a five-minute man-disadvantage in overtime. Their top skaters were buzzing, Jack Eichel contributing three assists and Mark Stone two apples of his own. They even mounted a stirring comeback, clawing back from 3-1 and then 4-2 in the third to send it to an extra frame.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It would seem that The Fourteenth Leo has some clarification to make regarding his CV. Not about his papal bona fides, which we are neither fit nor inclined to judge. So far, he knows how to wave to people who like him, which is both something and maybe most of the actual job. The issue, here, is whether he grew up a Cubs fan, as originally reported, or whether he is, as his brother later told WGN News, a White Sox fan. He owes the world an answer, and that clarification better not be in Latin, or read out of some leather-bound book of ancient Hebrew—if the Pope has an opinion about DeWayne Wise, we’ll need to hear it in plain, nasally Chicagoan. Preferably while Archbishop of the 35th Avenue Diocese Harold Baines holds up a copy of the Sun-Times behind him.
It would not be unlike some surreptitious member of Big Cub, perhaps the shadowy Archbishop Bartman, to jump the gun on "Pope Durocher," as they doubtless would call him. But let's say that the former Bobby Prevost’s brother John is right. Let’s say that the man who is now the pope did grow up a White Sox fan, in a household with a Cubs fan mother and a Cardinals fan father. There would, in this case, be some signs of pre-papal equanimity in making that compromise choice between two arch-rivals, and picking the White Sox would also make sense given that meek-inheriting-the-earth lie. He could put that debate to rest for good by beginning his papacy by forgiving all the Black Sox and Arnold Rothstein, too. But we can only speculate on such matters.]]></summary>
