                              <span>The Mission Impossible franchise is famous for its mask reveals. A dubiously explained technology allows an innocuous silver briefcase to print out a gummy-like mask that, once plastered to a face, transforms Tom Cruise into the spitting image of Philip Seymour Hoffman or various others, enabling him to infiltrate various lairs and turrets. The masks in Mission Impossible make for a fun game as a viewer: Is the bad guy you&#x27;re watching really a bad guy, or is he actually Ethan Hunt?
If Mission Impossible ever took place in a colony of harvester termites in the mountains of Morocco, Ethan Hunt might be, for once, out of a job. A new paper in Current Biology describes how the larvae of a blow fly has evolved to live, apparently unnoticed, inside the nests of harvester termites. Its main strategy, it seems, is the &quot;termite mask&quot; that protrudes from its rump. This mask features two antennae, a pair of sensory palps, and two large red &quot;eyes&quot; that are actually breathing holes. (Yes, the termite breathes from its butt; so what!)</span>

                              <span>According to the the 2024 National League Most Valuable Player award, Shohei Ohtani was the most valuable player in the National League in 2024. He achieved this status on a new team, his World Series-winning Dodgers, as a mere designated hitter who nevertheless put up a 9.2 bWAR through 54 home runs, 59 stolen bases, a .390 OBP and a 1.036 OPS. He&#x27;s one of the most amazing position players any of us have ever seen, but get this: He pitches, too!
That&#x27;s right. It was easy to ignore with all that he gave the Dodgers last season, but LA was only receiving half of the Ohtani package in 2024. Due to an elbow injury, Ohtani hasn&#x27;t taken the mound for an MLB game in nearly 18 months, but from 2021 to 2023 he was an ace-caliber hurler for the Angels, peaking in that middle campaign with a 1.012 WHIP and a 172 ERA+ off an AL-leading 11.9 strikeouts per nine.

                              <span>Across much of the animal kingdom, the meanings behind some creatures&#x27; gestures are reserved only for other members of their species. A person watching a honeybee&#x27;s waggle dance would not understand the information about a pollen-rich flower patch or nearby watering hole that the bee is communicating through its dance. Anyone lucky enough to witness the busty dance of the sage grouse will certainly be impressed—but of what, exactly, they may not be so sure. And yet I recently learned of a behavior in turtles called &quot;turtle dance&quot; whose meaning was immediately obvious to me, a non-turtle.
Without further ado, I present to you the turtle dance:</span>

                              <span>Connor McDavid scored the opening goal of Team Canada&#x27;s hotly anticipated 4 Nations game in Montreal on Saturday night, but it wasn&#x27;t enough for a home-team victory. The Canadians would go on to surrender two in response on frustrating mistakes, then find themselves locked up by conservative defense as an empty netter made the final score 3-1. Nevertheless, a date with Finland to end the round-robin stage on Monday afternoon still gives them hope, as a win would likely propel them into a Thursday night final weighted with the possibility of revenge.
Not a lot of hockey games start like this one did, as the rowdy Tkachuk boys and the rowdy canuck boys announced the intensity of their competitiveness from the moment the puck dropped. Brandon Hagel had a ferocious fight with Matthew Tkachuk just two seconds in, and after the officials pulled the two off the ice and put them in the penalty box, Brady Tkachuk and Canada&#x27;s Sam Bennett sabotaged the attempt to restore order. Officially three seconds into the game, the refs cleared out so the two could consensually hit each other until Brady executed a tackle on Bennett. A tiny bit of hockey happened after those penalty minutes appeared on the box score. But when Canada goalie Jordan Binnington froze the puck with 19:51 on the clock, it was JT Miller and St. Albert&#x27;s own Colton Parayko whose tempers boiled over, with Parayko using his size to hold off Miller&#x27;s assault until the two were exhausted.</span>

                              <span>JuJu Watkins was everything and the only thing. On Thursday night against No. 1 UCLA, she was the beginning, hitting three threes in the first quarter to send that awful she’s got it tonight feeling through the Bruins’ stomachs. She was the middle, literally all of it. When the sophomore guard found teammate Kennedy Smith alone at the rim in transition to start the fourth quarter, Smith’s layup was USC’s first non-Watkins field goal since the end of the first. And then she was the end. In the fourth quarter, the No. 6 Trojans trailing and gasping for breath, she blocked three shots in the span of a minute and scored two quick baskets to regain the lead her team had lost early in the third.
Not until the two-minute mark of the fourth quarter did any of her teammates finally break double digits. But by that point, there was no mystery left. JuJu Watkins had spoiled the plot: No matter how many times UCLA took control, no matter how many layups her teammates fumbled, no matter how sludgy the offense got, she would not be losing tonight. End of story.</span>

In a few months, that museum will receive its own prize from the Eagles’ win—an Édouard Manet painting, won on loan from Kansas City’s Nelson-Atkins Museum in a Super Bowl bet.
This is the second time the museums have wagered on the Super Bowl; two years ago in April KC’s museum got Thomas Eakins’s 1875 oil painting Sailing from the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It was on display for about two months. While it would be Very Philadelphian to have settled this bet using a Philadelphia artist, the Nelson-Atkins curators were the ones to pick that painting from the PMA’s collection.</span>

                              <span>Although an American politician will have plenty of occasions to denounce racism, it&#x27;s rare that said politician would be put in a position to denounce racism toward Indians, specifically. Rarer still is the scenario in which such a politician has an Indian wife and kids himself.
Vice President JD Vance found himself in those narrow circumstances earlier this month. Marko Elez, a 25-year-old enlistee at Elon Musk&#x27;s center for bussin&#x27; constitutional violations, had been linked to a Twitter account that posted things like &quot;Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,&quot; and &quot;Normalize Indian hate.&quot; Straightforwardly vile stuff, although I must note that if Elez really did attend Rutgers and major in computer science, he wasn&#x27;t trying all that hard to avoid us.</span>

                              <span>Halley&#x27;s Comment: I have to admit that I had a hard time finding the motivation to do this year’s comment roundup (and likely wouldn’t have without Drewbert’s encouragement). This may have something to do with why a post about comments we liked from 2024 is being published in February 2025.
Things generally feel real bad right now, and that has a way of permeating just about everything. It can make posting a comment on the internet seem even more pointless than normal (which should be impossible), and it can make compiling a list of comments from one website (even our favorite website) seem like a gigantic waste of time.  But you know what, we got into looking through comments, and I found myself forgetting these feelings and laughing instead.</span>

                              <span>Donald Trump’s last-minute decision to release water into Tulare County reservoirs as a belated solution to the fires in Southern California didn’t make much sense to anyone. The water wouldn’t actually make it to Los Angeles, and the places in the San Joaquin Valley where it was going are more at risk of flooding right now than of drying out. Even the supposed beneficiaries of the water windfall knew that gorging now meant potentially being dry during the long hot summers when they actually needed the water. 
“A decision to take summer water from local farmers and dump it out of these reservoirs shows a complete lack of understanding of how the system works and sets a very dangerous precedent,” Dan Vink, a longtime Tulare County water manager told SJV Water.</span>

                              <span>The United States in 2025 may not be among the world leaders in human rights. Or democracy. Or education. Or healthcare, press freedom, income equality, environmental protection, political transparency, child and maternal mortality, or life expectancy. But no one can say we don&#x27;t have one hell of a hockey team. USA! USA! USA!
Just how good this Team USA is, heralded as perhaps the best roster the country has ever iced, is still to be determined, even after a 6-1 shellacking of Finland in Montreal on Thursday night that served as both a barometer and a warm-up for Saturday&#x27;s throwdown with Team Canada. Business was taken care of against the overmatched Finns, even if it took a little while to transact. &quot;We either win or we learn,&quot; said Finland captain Aleksander Barkov. &quot;We learned a lot.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Most Super Bowls fade pretty quickly from memory, but it takes a special sort of dud to basically tape over itself in real time. Super Bowl 59, for all the highlights it generated and the broader satisfaction of its thoroughness, was more or less erasing itself as it happened; by the time it finally lapsed into the Rob Lowe-hosted game show that followed it on FOX, it was pretty much gone and the long sports winter already felt deep and endless. For Defector, this is both a challenge, because there just aren&#x27;t a lot of sports happening right now, and something of an opportunity to stretch out a little bit, write some anglerfish fiction and jarringly vivid descriptions of bad smells and the like.</span>

                              <span>Blue whales are not just the largest animals alive today, but the largest animals to ever live on Earth. They can stretch past 100 feet long and weigh up to 330,000 pounds. Being this big, it seems, should render blue whales impervious to predators. But just as no bank is too big to fail, no whale is too big to totally evade being eaten by the ocean&#x27;s top predator. Killer whales prey on nearly every large animal species found in the ocean, and blue whales are no exception.
In 2022, scientists confirmed that a pod of orcas can take down an adult blue whale, not to mention the smaller calves they frequently hunt. &quot;Killer whale attacks on large whales is the biggest predation event that occurs on the planet,&quot; Robert Pitman, a researcher with the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University, wrote in an email. &quot;There probably hasn’t been anything on that scale since dinosaurs roamed the earth.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Being a sports fan is never more embarrassing than in those moments when it&#x27;s made clear that your personal obsessions and hangups are your own. All it takes are a few accurately derisive tweets from Kevin Durant, or a photo of two players you thought were sworn enemies chumming it up at one of Michael Rubin&#x27;s awful parties, to be reminded that the people who actually play these games experience the sport in ways that are entirely alien to you, and vice versa.
There are moments, however, when the membrane between athletes and fans is at its thinnest, and the game in question resolves into a universal experience in which everyone is a fanatic. On Wednesday, Everton and Liverpool created one of these moments.</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s a document on my computer called &quot;food.txt.&quot; According to the metadata, I created it in October 2023, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve opened it at least every couple days since. It would be incoherent to anyone who sneaked a peek, but it&#x27;s a very useful piece of infrastructure in my life. It&#x27;s a list of entrees, basically, with sections separated by planned grocery store trips. There are no specific dates attached, but the list is reverse chronological: Whatever I&#x27;m going to eat next is at the top, and my future meals proceed from there. At the very bottom are meals I want to make but don&#x27;t have an assigned spot in the batting order yet.
The document is adjusted and revised often, which is why I don&#x27;t lock in any meal to a particular day. When I make social plans that involve eating, or would cause me to miss a meal, I do some shuffling. As I write this, though, &quot;food.txt&quot; stretches out eight weeks in advance—pastas, chicken recipes, tacos, even a tentative visit to a bagel shop. It sounds very intense, I know. It&#x27;s a symptom of an anxious mind that leans heavily on structures and plans. But I&#x27;m still kind of proud of how I got here.</span>

                              <span>Napheesa Collier was angry when the Minnesota Lynx lost Game 5 of the WNBA Finals in October. Given her own stellar play in that series, and the combined shortcomings of the referees and her backcourt in Game 5, she was right to be. These days, she is no less angry. In an interview with Taylor Rooks in January, prefacing that she might “get beef for saying this,” Collier declared that she would never get over the loss. When Rooks asked her what she meant by “getting beef,” Collier explained, “People just calling me a sore loser. I’m like, I am a sore loser. It sucks! I agree with you. I am very sore about losing.” 
One of the problems the startup basketball league Unrivaled was meant to solve was that WNBA stars’ overseas arrangements kept them out of sight, out of mind for a long time. To brands or corporate sponsors, it was hardly ideal for a potential endorser to spend only half the year stateside. To fans and players, there was something else frustrating about these big offseason gaps. Last impressions are strong, and six months is too much time to keep stewing in them.</span>
