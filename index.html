                              <span>Lots of fans can claim to be &quot;long-suffering&quot; as a labeling fetish, even if they aren&#x27;t. New York Liberty fans, for instance, were long-suffering—until Sunday night, when they cashed in their 28 years without a championship and transitioned into &quot;deliriously smug, smugly delirious, and not even pissed at Sabrina Ionescu any more.&quot; It happens that fast. The previous almost-three decades notwithstanding, they got their money&#x27;s worth, and then some.
And then there&#x27;s this World Series, which is the dead opposite, and more&#x27;s the pity. Nothing will leaden eyelids quite like listening to Yankee fans and Dodger fans grind on the rest of us civilians about their respective places on the double-decker throne, let alone their shared hearkening back to their joint heritage as the keepers of the sport back when baseball had not yet cracked the Pacific Time Zone. A nation already hopelessly fractured and ready to go even more Serb and Croat two Tuesdays from now can safely unite as one, however briefly, in our hatred of both teams. The prognosis wasn’t good regardless, but expect the next fortnight to be hell with a Bob Costas voiceover. Fox has the games, but it&#x27;s not his voice that offends, you see; rather the subject matter.</span>

                              <span>How would you imagine the greatest individual season in NWSL history? Our hypothetical player would need to score a lot of goals, obviously. Breaking Sam Kerr&#x27;s single-season scoring record (18) would certainly get plenty of attention, so let&#x27;s put that at the top of the list. How about assists? Assists are important, too. Let&#x27;s say this player has ... five of those. Five sounds good. 
Let&#x27;s go back to the goals for a second. We know that all goals aren&#x27;t created equal, and that poachers and penalty specialists can often sneak their way to the top of the leaderboard. That just won&#x27;t do—we&#x27;re talking about the best season in history, here—so let&#x27;s make sure our player didn&#x27;t score any of her goals from the spot, and is out-performing her expected goals tally by two. We need more, though. Let&#x27;s get crazy and say that this player is an NWSL rookie, and arrived from Chinese Women&#x27;s Super League at age 25 to blitz the NWSL with the league&#x27;s first 20-goal season. We&#x27;ll need a fun, quirky statistic, too, so let&#x27;s say this player became the first in league history to score a goal against every team. And we need moments. Like, what if the record-breaking goal happened to be a 25-yard strike that makes a convincing case for being the hardest a soccer ball has ever been struck by a woman in a professional match? What if that goal looked something like this:</span>

                              <span>The playoffs tend to provide certain reminders about how postseason baseball works. The Yankees, in completing their 4-1 series win over the Cleveland Guardians to advance to the World Series, provided one about the importance of power. Hit 10 home runs in five games, as the Yankees did in this series, and you can overcome all manner of base-running errors, scuffed defensive work, and late-inning meltdowns. Just keep hitting the ball over the fence, and good things will happen for you.
Here&#x27;s another reminder: There is probably no hitter in baseball more terrifying to pitch to in a high-leverage situation than Juan Soto. The Yankees right fielder came to the plate in the top of the 10th inning, with the score tied 2-2, two men on base, and two outs. Soto was looking for a fastball from Hunter Gaddis, and he wasn&#x27;t going to let the at-bat end until he got one. What must it feel like to pitch to a locked-in Juan Soto, who possesses not only all the confidence and power that makes for a great clutch hitter, but one of the games most discerning eyes. I imagine it feels like being asked to chop down a redwood with a hatchet.</span>

                              <span>MINNEAPOLIS — Somehow, this will end, though your guess is as good as mine. In Game 4 on Friday night, the Lynx and Liberty arrived in a familiar place by unfamiliar means. Neither team bothered with the pretense of an early lead or deficit. This time, they played a game that from tip to buzzer felt true to the series: weird, tense, a matter of execution more than scheme. A Jonquel Jones layup and-one to even things up, 80-80, with a minute left, was the 13th tying score of the game. With 18 seconds left, the Lynx searching for a last shot, Bridget Carleton grabbed an offensive rebound and was fouled on the putback attempt. She made two free throws for a 14th and final lead change, 82-80. The WNBA’s two best teams head where they have long seemed destined, to a decisive Game 5 in New York on Sunday night. 
Lynx head coach Cheryl Reeve explained the game’s closeness in terms of “information gathered.” Game 5 will be the ninth time these teams have played each other this season, and the familiarity is starting to show. “Everything is getting harder,” Reeve said. “There’s no secrets at this point.” The teams’ de facto captains, products of the same college program and models of the league’s richness at power forward, pose identical matchup problems to each other. The lead guards can claim crowning moments. Last night, the two starting centers traded threes. Styles make fights, maybe, but never discount the thrill of a pointing Spider-Man series.</span>

It has all of social media&#x27;s favorite thematic elements: sex work, wealth and excess, class commentary, hot people, &quot;bisexual lighting,&quot; Tumblr-baiting images. It&#x27;s hard not to feel a little cynical when a movie so readily, gleefully plays the hits, though perhaps that is the point—the late-millennial/Gen Z cheese to lure in that audience and trap them into its fable about the limits of transactional fantasies.

                              <span>The Saint Louis Chess Club announced Wednesday night that 17-year-old grandmaster Christopher Yoo had been expelled from the U.S. Chess Championships for &quot;gross violations of our Code of Conduct and the U.S, Chess Safe Play Policy&quot; after he crumpled up his scorecard, stormed off, and allegedly &quot;struck a videographer from behind&quot; following his fifth-round loss to Fabiano Caruana. Per local NBC station KSDK, the cops said that Yoo was arrested and charged with fourth-degree assault. They identified the victim as a 24-year-old woman and confirmed that Yoo was released as the case will be dealt with in the juvenile court system.
While Yoo&#x27;s scorecard meltdown was captured on video, no recording of the full incident has been made public from which we can contextualize the somewhat vague verb &quot;struck.&quot; This has prompted some players such as former World Championship challenger Ian Nepomniatchi to wonder whether Yoo getting fully booted from the tournament was an overreaction. That&#x27;s a fair question—though, according to both KSDK and arbiter Chris Bird, Yoo outright punched the videographer, with Bird calling the punch &quot;completely unprovoked, from behind and in no way accidental.&quot; Levon Aronian, currently competing in the championships, said he saw a video of the &quot;awful&quot; punch and called it a &quot;well prepared punch to a completely innocent person.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Point: Friday playoff games are terrible, by Barry Petchesky
I sit here exhausted: glassy eyed, cotton-brained, every synapse a misery. I watched seven consecutive hours of baseball last night, most of them emotionally disastrous to my rooting interests. It kept me up several hours past my usual bedtime, and tossing and turning in much of my ostensible sleep. Today I feel like I got hit by a truck. I feel alive. This is how the postseason should feel.</span>

                              <span>Approaching José Quintana&#x27;s pitching should be relatively straightforward: Do not chase. The man does not throw strikes. Only about 41 percent of his pitches in 2024 have been in the zone, which ranks dead last among all MLB pitchers who threw at least 1500 pitches last season. 
That is just about the most aggravating archetype of pitcher to watch mow through your team&#x27;s lineup, but for all the readied complaints about plate discipline or sloppy hitting, suffering at the hands of Quintana was not a unique experience: Quintana had looked unhittable since late August. Clearly if the advice is, &quot;Please stop chasing,&quot; looking at batters trying to hit against Quintana leads to the conclusion that it&#x27;s not that easy.</span>

                              <span>Gigi Hadid opened the Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show Tuesday night to the pre-chorus of Chappell Roan&#x27;s &quot;Femininomenon.&quot; She sunk into a platform on the stage and the models began their first push down a runway that was once iconic but is now grasping for relevance. It makes some sort of sense that Victoria’s Secret chose this song to frame the return of its fashion show, which is actually just a long ad that the company managed to turn into a weird cultural touchpoint for 20 years.
Chappell Roan is one of the biggest pop stars of the year, and her earworm singles are the perfect kind of good-vibes, girl-power music for corporate advertisements, as long as you don’t listen to the lyrics too closely. Previous versions of the show might have had an artist like her join the Angels on the runway, but there’s no way Chappell Roan would have appeared at this. “Femininomenon” is a queer awakening, and a reminder of what lies on the other side of living for the male gaze, male approval, and male mediocrity. The pre-chorus goes, “I don’t understand why can’t any man / Hit it like / Get it hot/ Make a bitch / It&#x27;s a femme.” In the show, the word “bitch” was muted, which was jarring at first, but in a way also perfectly encapsulated the show&#x27;s toothless attempt at corporate feminism in its bid to recapture the affections of young women across the country.</span>

                              <span>In what has been something of a bait-and-switch experience for us both, Rohan Nadkarni&#x27;s last two visits to the podcast have come during weeks when I was out. Strategically, this is sound, just given that Rohan is effectively a third host whenever he&#x27;s on. But for both him and me, it was kind of a raw deal. Has he had any new sandwiches since last we spoke? Formulated any new opinions about Josh McRoberts? I suppose I could listen to those podcast appearances and learn the answers myself but uh, hold on, sorry. Sorry I have to start a new paragraph right now, it&#x27;s an emergency. Sorry!
Anyway, it was great to finally be reunited with two of my favorite podcast buddies for what turned out to be both a typically goofy and decently sports-heavy episode. It turns out Rohan has a new job, and at the risk of spoiling the episode, he has had some sandwiches lately.</span>

                              <span>The Tampa Bay Rays have no home. Well, actually they have a home but no roof, and as most of us understand the concept, a home without a roof is just an enclosure.
Hurricane Milton, the bastard that it was, tore the aged canvas-and-fiberglass roof off of Tropicana Field, the Soviet bunker–style home of the Rays since they were Devil Rays, and because the Trop is due to be replaced as part of our ongoing national stadium scam, there is no urgency to replace the roof or even necessarily play any more games on the grounds. It’s very much up in the air whether it will or even can be repaired for the 2025 season. As new stadiums usually need three years or so for construction (except for the A&#x27;s, who have needed 19 and still don&#x27;t have a hole in the ground), the Rays could be vagabonds through 2027, if not beyond.</span>

If they annoy you because of the money they spent to win 103 games and counting and get halfway to the World Series—well, their payroll ranks third among the four remaining postseason teams. If they annoy you because they have been pegged as the postseason ratings savior for Major League Baseball—well, ratings stopped mattering the moment the league’s new media contracts were signed. If they annoy you because you&#x27;re sick to death of Shohei Ohtani stan-dom—well, you got us there, although we suspect that no one is actually sick of that. If they annoy you because of their fans, and the volume at which they make their case—well, name a fan base that isn&#x27;t annoying as a basic function of their existence.</span>

                              <span>Just two weeks after Helene barreled across Florida as a Category 4 hurricane and ripped through five other states, Category 3 Hurricane Milton delivered a devastating follow-up to the Sunshine State. Although Florida is more than familiar with extreme weather events, the back-to-back nature of such powerful storms has strapped the resources of a state that was still reeling from the aftermath of the impact of Hurricane Debby two months ago.
Helene proved the deadlier of the two storms, carrying devastating flooding to western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee and killing more than 200 people. As of Oct. 15, 92 people are still missing in North Carolina. In Florida, Milton ended up sparing a direct hit on Tampa that would have caused catastrophic, lethal flooding damage. Instead, the storm made landfall 70 miles south in Siesta Key, and its aftermath has killed at least 14 people. Milton left more than 3.2 million homes and businesses in the state without power, some of which had been without power since Helene hit.</span>
