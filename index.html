                              <span>Coming into last Sunday&#x27;s match against Arsenal in the Women&#x27;s Super League, the Chelsea starting lineup was missing some of its, and therefore the world&#x27;s, best players. Some of these superstar absences were injury related—the recently recovered Lauren James was only fit enough for the substitute&#x27;s bench, while Sam Kerr remains at least a few weeks away from her long-awaited comeback from last January&#x27;s ACL tear. Thankfully, the one big-name omission from Chelsea&#x27;s lineup that had the stadium and the sport as a whole abuzz was the opposite of depressing. Earlier that day the club had officially announced the signing of USWNT legend-in-the-making Naomi Girma, who came from the San Diego Wave via a record-breaking transfer fee. Girma, who obviously couldn&#x27;t play on Sunday having only just signed her contract with the team hours before, was on hand at Stamford Bridge before the match began, smiling at and waving to the attending fans, who surely feel like they&#x27;ve won a jackpot some orders of magnitude larger than the $1.1 million it cost to bring Girma across the pond.
But amidst all the excitement about the biggest defensive talent in world soccer moving for the largest fee in women&#x27;s soccer history, there was a game to play, and an important one at that. Chelsea vs. Arsenal is probably the WSL&#x27;s preeminent rivalry match, pitting the two best-supported and, along with Manchester City, most serious clubs in England against one another in a crosstown match that always has significant title implications. This edition was no different. Chelsea came in looking to extend its lead atop the table, while Arsenal sought to claw its way back into the title race.</span>

                              <span>There is a website that might tell you how you&#x27;re going to die. It&#x27;s constantly updated with various potential causes of your death, and their odds. I don&#x27;t visit this website regularly, which might sound surprising at first—wouldn&#x27;t you think I&#x27;d want to know this?—but the website is superfluous. If one if the items on the list causes your death, it&#x27;s likely to cause the deaths of many, most, or all other humans on Earth. Once we get to that point, I figure it&#x27;ll be on the news or something.
The site is Sentry, an automated prediction system run by NASA&#x27;s JPL. It lists near-Earth asteroids, and their chances of hitting us, and projects the damage they would do. It offers a helpful 10-point scale to tell us how worried we should be. As of this week, there&#x27;s a new asteroid atop the leaderboard, rated a 3.</span>

                              <span>I will admit, there was a point at the start of New York magazine&#x27;s profile of the jubilant young Trumper right when I started to get nervous. The article opens on Inauguration Day, depicting a party scene in D.C. full of young people enjoying the night, the atmosphere, and each other, the kind of celebrations that have felt all too rare in the COVID-19 pandemic&#x27;s aftermath. I found myself thinking, Could it really be that the right has stolen partying and nightlife from under our nose? Is their scene truly, viscerally alive in a way the fractured and depressed left no longer seems to be? Could they actually be the cool ones now? These fears emerged quickly and were doused ever quicker as I kept reading:
Conservatism — as a cultural force, not just a political condition — is back in a real way for the first time since the 1980s. But here in D.C., among the tourists from Tampa, the donors, and the last politicians Trump whipped into submission, one can also witness the emerging influence of a newer type of conservative. They are not disenfranchised or working class or anti-elite or many of the other adjectives used to describe Trump supporters since 2016. Rather, they are young, imposingly well connected, urban, and very online. They are rebels once again storming Capitol Hill, though without the pathetic scariness of the January 6 rioters.</span>

                              <span>When things just happen to work out for you, do you chalk that up to coincidence, or is it something more? Julia Cameron would call that a synchronicity, and in Week 3 of The Artist&#x27;s Way, she had us keeping an eye out for them. According to Cameron, synchronicities are more than just happy accidents; they&#x27;re indications that the universe (or god, or whatever) is responding positively to active changes you&#x27;re making in your life. 
This part of Cameron&#x27;s philosophy veers a bit dangerously into Power of Positive Thinking territory for many of our tastes. But in the spirit of doing the process in good faith, we continued to show up for our morning pages and artist dates. (By the way, if you&#x27;re just catching this now, a few of us at Defector are blogging our way through Julia Cameron&#x27;s The Artist&#x27;s Way this winter.)</span>

                              <span>The Boston Celtics are by no means in any trouble. They lost Monday night at home to the ascending Houston Rockets, and yes, the Celtics are now more than five games back of the Cleveland Cavaliers at the top of the Eastern Conference; also yes, they&#x27;ve been playing approximately .500 ball since the middle of December. Yes, too, fine: The New York Knicks are breathing midtown hot dog breath down their necks. Still: The Celtics are in no real danger of sliding out of contention. They&#x27;ve had some bad luck in the clutch, going 11–10 over a stretch of games where they&#x27;ve posted the fourth best net rating in the league. This is a tough part of their schedule, they&#x27;re not entirely healthy, and a competent team can only slide so far in the soft East. They&#x27;ll be fine.
If you imagined Joe Mazzulla&#x27;s perfected ActuariBall made the Celtics immune from hard times—and whether that thought filled you with comfort or dread—I suppose this recent slump has disabused you of the notion. It is precisely on the side of the ball where Boston leans furthest into math mode that they are presently struggling: Per Cleaning The Glass, over the last two weeks Boston&#x27;s offense, which on the season scores the third most points per possession in the NBA, has dropped to 16th in efficiency, just above the ridiculous Charlotte Hornets and just below the somehow even more ridiculous Philadelphia 76ers. They&#x27;ve been hucking just as many threes as ever, but where the Celtics were above average by proficiency across the first two months of the season, since their unexpected home loss to the Chicago Bulls on Dec. 19 they have fallen to eighth worst. It&#x27;s not entirely that simple, but also, the Celtics are to a certain extent dying by the sword. Mazzulla&#x27;s offense seeks to remove some of the variance of distance shooting by maximizing volume, but it is still, by God, a make-or-miss league. Monday night it was the dreaded Dillon Brooks doing the making, to the deep and audible exasperation of the Boston faithful:</span>

                              <span>The milky specks known as hummingbird mites are among the most skilled hitchhikers in the world. They live their lives inside flowers and inflorescences, where they feed on nectar and pollen, mate, and produce their young. But all flowers eventually wither and die, and a mite, approximately the size of a grain of sugar, is far too tiny to set out into the world in search of a new flower. Instead, it awaits the beak of a hungry hummingbird to dip into the chute of their flower. When one arrives, the mite leaps from petal to beak, where it crawls inside the bird&#x27;s nostrils to hitch a ride and hop off whenever the bird visits another flower of the same species.
These mites, however, lack wings, as well as the ability to jump. So how do they manage to leap from beak to flower and back? A new paper reveals the arachnids actually harness the power of electrostatic attraction to make the leap. Once the mites detect the signature electrical charge of a hummingbird—an ability known as electroreception—they whoosh through the air, their itty-bitty bodies riding the charged air. The new paper is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</span>

                              <span>Nothing much of note happened to the Washington Wizards last night, which is to say the same thing that usually happens to them happened again. They lost their 14th game in succession, a routine 130-108 loss to the truncated Dallas Mavericks, and in so doing became the 98th team in NBA history to compile a losing streak that long. We mention that only because the 97th team to do it was the Wizards back in November, when they lost 16 straight before the holiday sales had time to gather steam. They are 6-39 this morning, the 15th-worst record after 45 games in history, and only one game better than last year&#x27;s Pistons, who lost games 4 through 31.
That Pistons team was thought to be among the worst of all time, and for two months they were. But whatever passes as desire for a team that finished 14-68 flashed as often as not after their losing streak; by a stretchy definition, those Pistons played hard, or at least as hard as a doomed team can be expected to play.</span>

                              <span>DETROIT — There was a brief moment where I, as a child growing up in Michigan, thought heaven might look something like the North American International Auto Show. Inside a vast convention center hall, impossibly shiny cars stretched out before me in a vast maze that seemed to hold surprises around each corner. There were driving simulators to play and collectible cards to hoard. I could sit in the front seat of a car, and did, racing from vehicle to vehicle on the showroom floor. Everything was sleek and perfect. Maybe not when my friends and I got yelled at for touching the cars at the Porsche display. But everything else was perfect. 
When you’re a kid in the Mitten State, there are a lot of car-related field trips. You can go to the Ford Rouge Factory Tour, where you watch F-150s get assembled. At the historical Greenfield Village, one highlight is being able to ride around in a refurbished Model T. Many Michigan museums have some form of an auto manufacturing exhibit. Still, the auto show always stood out.</span>

                              <span>In two weeks, the Philadelphia Eagles will play the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl. Every single day until then a bunch of people will use &quot;data&quot; and &quot;history&quot; to try to predict who will win. But sports are about vibes (which can also be called &quot;luck&quot;) as much as they are about talent. And so we must measure the vibes of these teams. Luckily, it is easy to do this because we have an useful comparison point: Chief&#x27;s tight end Travis Kelce and Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts both wore tan suits this past Sunday.
Let&#x27;s see how they compare!</span>

                              <span>LAS VEGAS — There is something unstable at the most basic level about any space with too much capitalism happening in it. The air is all wrong, there&#x27;s simultaneously too much in it and not enough of it. Everyone I spoke to about the Consumer Electronics Show before I went to it earlier this month kept describing it in terms that involved wetness in some way. I took this as a warning, which I believe was the spirit in which it was intended, but I felt prepared for it. Your classically damp commercial experiences have a sort of terroir to them, a signature that marks a confluence of circumstances and time- and place-specific appetites; I have carried with me for decades the peculiar smell, less that of cigarette smoke than cigarette smoke in hair, that I remember from a baseball card show at a Ramada Inn that I attended as a kid. Only that particular strain of that particular kind of commerce, at that moment, gave off that specific distress signal. It was the smell of a living thing, and the dampness in the (again, quite damp) room was in part because that thing was breathing, heavily.
CES, which this year claimed 141,000 attendees and 4,500 exhibitors, could on the other hand have been anywhere, or everywhere. That it was held across several vast convention spaces in Las Vegas certainly helped with that placelessness, or everyplacefulness, but the overwhelming volume and scale of the thing ensured it. The air in every space was charged with all that commerce, somehow shortened by the competition for it, but it wasn&#x27;t close in the ways that I had prepared myself for.</span>

                              <span>The protracted standoff between the Miami Heat and Jimmy Butler, which has always been more of a mid-off given the relative states of the parties involved, has taken yet another turn. ESPN&#x27;s Shams Charania reports that Butler has now been suspended indefinitely, following an incident at today&#x27;s shootaround in which he walked off the court after being informed that he would not be starting Monday night&#x27;s game against the Orlando Magic.
It has been several weeks since Butler first made an explicit demand to be traded, and if I am being honest, I have not really kept track of all the developments since. Headlines and BREAKING NEWS reports have passed along the edge of my awareness, heralding various suspensions and returns from suspensions, and meetings with ownership, and agent back-channeling, and so on and so on. At some point, I am pretty sure I read something about Butler renting his own house in Boulder during the 2023 Finals. It&#x27;s been difficult to keep track of all this, only because it is difficult to raise much concern about a player vs. front office battle as juiceless as this one.</span>

                              <span>I knew it was over when Tress Way’s pass was in the air. Jeremiah Trotter Jr. was too far behind whichever Washington player was running free downfield. I didn’t yet know the name of the guy who was going to end the Eagles’ season was, but I learned. A third-string tight end named Ben Sinnott caught that 23-yard pass on a fake punt, and this was absolutely the turning point. The Commanders were down 14-3 at that moment, but I knew what was going to happen next. I was already thinking about how Way and Sinnott were going to become part of DC sports lore, famous for the play that turned around a game that seemed to be getting away from them. The Commanders were going to win the NFC Championship.
I like to think I’m a reasonable person, but I am not. There were still two minutes left in the first quarter when my brain decided that the Eagles, up two scores and moving the ball with ease, were going to lose. Anyway, that Commanders’ drive ended with a field goal and not a touchdown, and I relaxed a little. Some time later, the Eagles won the game by the score of 55-23.</span>

                              <span>On Nov. 23, Tottenham Hotspur notched what would be most teams&#x27; season-defining victory, smacking the ever-loving crap out of Manchester City 4-0 on the road. Even in light of the well-documented tailspin City was in the midst of at the time, Tottenham&#x27;s performance that day was a perfect exhibition of manager Ange Postecoglou&#x27;s whirlwind of chaos. It was also a much-needed salve after the opening months of the season, which had seen Spurs&#x27; offense, once the best in the Premier League, routinely let down by a shorthanded defense that continuously conceded ill-timed goals, leading to a procession of narrow defeats.
That salve was short-lasting, as Tottenham&#x27;s season went from mildly frustrating to complete shambles soon after the win over City. In the two months since, Tottenham has won exactly one Premier League match—a 5-0 thrashing of bottom-dwelling Southampton on Dec. 15—to go with two draws and a gobsmacking eight losses. The run has dropped Spurs from the table&#x27;s sixth spot to its 15th, much closer to the relegation zone (eight points) than the top seven (16 points). While the schedule has not done the side any favors—in that span, Tottenham has played games ranging from tricky, like Fulham and Bournemouth, to exceedingly tough, like Liverpool, Arsenal, and the mighty Nottingham Forest—the biggest culprit for the collapse has been the team&#x27;s nightmarish injury situation, and Postecoglou has not had the answers for how to deal with it.</span>

                              <span>MELBOURNE – Envy sabotaged my plans for watching the first day of the 2025 Australian Open. I was going to take in Day One on a projector at Federation Square, a public area surrounded by angular buildings that look like they&#x27;ve been shattered and pieced back together for effect. There would be other people to help simulate a crowd, the city serves as a pretty backdrop, and I could save my money for later in the tournament. Unfortunately, Fed Square is between the city center and the Australian Open, and the endless stream of people walking past me on their way to the tournament obliterated my resistance. A quick tussle with Ticketmaster, a grounds pass purchase, and I was in. 
The walkways were choked with fans. The air smelled like sunscreen and sweat and perfectly matched the temperature of my skin. Then, as I observed last year&#x27;s finalist Qinwen Zheng hit devastating backhands on the big screen, raindrops splattered on my skin. Blinks of lightning disrupted the pleasant equilibrium. The band playing quietly in the background fired off an errant thrum of bass that rattled the ground. The rain paced itself at a reasonable patter at first, so I sought refuge in a crowd under some stilted, overhanging structures resembling giant lily pads, which I knew were for shade but hoped would block light rain. Then God&#x27;s gentle weeping turned into crocodile tears, soaking those of us underneath as if we were standing out in the open. I made for inside, laughing, and others were laughing too.</span>

                              <span>You can’t win against Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs. I know you THINK you can. I know you saw all those graphics about the Chiefs stringing together one-score win after one-score win and said to yourself, Well, that’s not analytically sustainable, right before they made your team their next victim. I know that the Bills, who spent the entirety of last night’s AFC title game playing like the proverbial dog on the porch who’s tired of getting kicked, could have won that game had just one thing gone differently. Slide a door and there isn’t a game-breaking disagreement between opposing side judges on Josh Allen’s failed fourth-down attempt. Slide another and Xavier Worthy doesn’t Fail Mary his way to the 3-yard line toward the close of the first half. Slide another and the Bills don’t call a piddly shit bubble screen on third-and-10 on their final drive. To lose to the Chiefs is to be trapped in a room of nothing but sliding doors, all of them bolted shut.
It’s enough to drive you mad, and that madness will be on full display today and forever. It will manifest itself on sports talk radio, and on television, and on the internet. The Bills were just an inch away from beating the Chiefs, you swear. It’s a lie that’s equal parts comforting and enraging. Buffalo should have won that game, you’ll tell everyone. But nefarious external forces—the refs, the league office, Big Government—deliberately fixed the outcome in Kansas City’s favor. It’s not just. It’s not even real. Fetch me my bag of asterisks. All my life, this has been the preferred defense mechanism for all sports fans in the face of greatness. This is because it feels better to deny greatness—to believe what can’t be defeated can be—than to accept that you and your team’s powerlessness against it.</span>

                              <span>I could feel a restful night of slumber coming on. I had just watched the Bills and Chiefs play a fantastic football game against each other, and I was floating around my house on that particular kind of emotional high that a great football game can bring. I let the dog out, and while I stood waiting for her by the door I thought about all the great plays I had seen Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes make, and James Cook&#x27;s heroic goal-line stretch, and Steve Spagnuolo calling one of history&#x27;s greatest blitzes. The dog came back in, and I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth. I was looking forward to sleep, and couldn&#x27;t wait to wake up this morning and resume thinking about how awesome that game was. While swishing my mouthwash, I idly took my phone out of my pocket and opened Twitter. That&#x27;s when I saw this:</span>

                              <span>Today we’re listening to Staying: Leaving Records Aid to Artists Impacted by the Los Angeles Wildfires. The collection consists of 98 tracks by artists such as André 3000, Emily Sprague, Laraaji, Arushi Jain, Celia Hollander, Photay, Total Blue, Sam Wilkes, Luke Schneider, marine eyes, Reggie Watts, and KMRU. To quote the liner notes, “Leaving has pulled out all the proverbial stops to release a benefit compilation consisting of affiliated artists and supporters far and wide (many of whom have indeed lost everything). Seeking to supplement the numerous GoFundMes and the profound, often harrowing acts of mutual aid that are currently buoying recovery efforts, and in lieu of donating to a third party organization, all proceeds will be donated directly to impacted individuals.” Just a Bandcamp link today.</span>

                              <span>So it&#x27;s the Super Bowl everyone hated because it&#x27;s the Super Bowl everyone feared—the one you saw two years ago. You know, the one with all the points and yards and lead changes and quarterback stuff. Yeah, that one. The one that sucked even though everyone liked it at the time.
Yes, you spoiled piglets, you&#x27;re getting the much-dreaded reprise of Chiefs-Eagles, the third-highest scoring Superb Owl of them all. It&#x27;s all because Josh Allen couldn&#x27;t reach Dalton Kincaid with a drive-saving pass because George Karlaftis was the one pass rusher the Buffalo Bills couldn&#x27;t account for with the AFC championship on the line, and because Patrick Mahomes could find Samaje Perine in the flat with the game&#x27;s security on the line. Because Kansas City is on a roll of winning games by a cheese-slice-thick margin almost unprecedented in NFL history and is, for the moment, the most unbeatable beatable team there has ever been. Because the Chiefs, for all their socially recidivist trappings, just knows how to do this shit.</span>

                              <span>When we last checked in with Quad God, aka figure skater Ilia Malinin, he was busy winning the 2024 figure skating world championships while landing six quad jumps. Now Malinin is back, and this weekend he competed a free skate that has him attempting seven quads, plus a now-legal backflip. Look, there&#x27;s no need to get too technical here. It&#x27;s. Seven. Freaking. Quads. (No one has ever landed seven clean in competition.) Sometimes, the facts explain themselves.
Malinin didn&#x27;t land all seven quads on Sunday at the U.S. figure skating championships, but his entire free skate is still impressive as hell.</span>

The Gators&#x27; most recent game was a thorough, 30-point stomping of rival Georgia. The squad is 18-2, third in the SEC, and ranked in the top 10 in both the coaches and AP polls. After years without a deep run in March Madness, the Stephen C. O’Connell Center&#x27;s Rowdy Reptiles seem to finally have good reason to get loud. 
Except on Nov. 8 The Independent Florida Alligator broke the story that the team&#x27;s head coach, Todd Golden, has been the subject of a university Title IX investigation since September. Per The Alligator, the complaint said that Golden was under investigation for allegations of sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, and stalking aimed at Florida students. From The Alligator:</span>

                              <span>The Washington Commanders are new to this big game thing, which is why they acted on their first drive like their only way to beat the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC championship game was to never relinquish the ball. They must have known that they would spend the rest of Sunday relinquishing everything.
Such is the price of being a newbie—errors happen and then compound themselves. The plucky underdog with the pretty new quarterback (Jayden Daniels) started out treating fourth down like it was second down with a bad attitude. They drove for 18 plays, converted two fourth-and-punt-the-ball downs, and ground out seven minutes of clock to give the game the chaotic feel that they needed it to have.  It worked out for the opening score, though weirdly they kicked a field goal rather than press their luck. It was the omen that nobody saw coming.</span>
