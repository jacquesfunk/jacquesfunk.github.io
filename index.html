                              <span>Ferrari had a great weekend at the Hungarian Grand Prix, so long as you ignore the bad parts. After an upgrade package, the team has been on the rise. They are currently second in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, and that&#x27;s factoring in their double disqualification in China earlier this year. During Saturday&#x27;s qualifying session, Charles Leclerc even managed to steal pole position away from the McLarens (and, somehow, Aston Martins) by a margin of .026 seconds. &quot;Today I don&#x27;t understand anything in Formula 1,&quot; Leclerc said, expressing his surprise by the pole during an &quot;extremely difficult&quot; qualifying.
As long as you stop there, the sentiment is optimistic rather than ominous. And if you memory hole every other moment of the weekend, you will forget Lewis Hamilton&#x27;s Q2 exit—material evidence of Ferrari&#x27;s &quot;extremely difficult&quot; qualifying—and his shockingly despondent media comments after the fact. Every all-time great is bound to have some decline in form, but even factoring in the margins from his teammate this year, Hamilton&#x27;s comments felt extreme. &quot;I&#x27;m useless, absolutely useless,&quot; Hamilton said. Prompted to expound, Hamilton added, &quot;The team, they have no problem. You&#x27;ve seen the car is on pole. So, they probably need to change driver.&quot;</span>

                              <span>It is a measure of the history of the Florida/Miami Marlins that Sunday feels like the third-biggest day in franchise history. It wasn&#x27;t, but this is what happens when your franchise has two World Series victories and seven other playoff games in 33 years. That third spot on the podium remains very much available.
Still, you take your moments when you can, and this is the Miami Marlins&#x27; moment. The moment in question being when the Marlins swept the New York Yankees at home before 101,000-some-odd announced mammals over the weekend to get their once-dismal record to a deliciously mediocre .500, and in so doing moved within hailing distance of the final wild card spot. That last thing doesn&#x27;t seem like much, and it probably isn&#x27;t, but the Marlins&#x27; fan base has decided that the Yankees are their archrivals despite the fact that Yankees, who are in a different league, barely acknowledge that the Marlins even exist. Yankees fans weren&#x27;t even sure the Marlins existed in 2003 when the Marlins beat the Yankees to win their last World Series.</span>

                              <span>If conventional wisdom holds that international tournament finals are often boring and conservatively played, the Copa América Femenina final between Brazil and Colombia was a glorious exception. Eight goals, an under-punished headbutt, four total comebacks, a returning legend contributing yet another legendary feat, a tense if not stellar penalty shootout ... Saturday&#x27;s match in Quito, Ecuador had just about everything. The only thing it lacked was an upset, as the favored Brazil fought back time and time again to win the shootout, lifting its fifth straight Copa trophy.

                              <span>Jhoan Durán was one of the prizes of a busy trade deadline, moving from the suddenly tanking Twins to a Phillies team in a dogfight with the very best of the National League. Durán is not just an electric arm, but a very marketable one, as well. Along with his 2.01 ERA in 49 games with Minnesota, the closer arrived in Pennsylvania with his own A/V package. According to The Athletic, the Twins sent over all the assets that the Phillies would need to recreate the entrance that Durán&#x27;s old club gave him at their home field. That package includes lights, music, and an animation of a tarantula (Durántula) crawling across a video board.
&quot;We collectively thought, ‘This is for the greater good of baseball fans,’&quot; said Dustin Morse, Twins VP of communications. &quot;This is a fun atmosphere. All baseball fans should get to see it and experience it. We all know that the atmosphere at Citizens Bank is already nuts. This would go over well.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Miguel Cairo, interim manager for the woebegone Washington Nationals, recently referred to the Milwaukee Brewers as a &quot;pain-in-the-butt team.&quot; He&#x27;d just watched the Brewers rough up Washington&#x27;s helpless pitchers in the first game of a weekend series, and struggled to put his observations into admiring terms. &quot;They make contact. They put the ball in play. They find a way to create runs.&quot; It&#x27;s all true: The Brewers have the best team batting average and on-base percentage in the National League; they don&#x27;t do a lot of slugging but they swipe a lot of bases, and they will absolutely doink and small-ball your ass all the way to death. Per Statcast, the Brewers have the lowest barrel percentage and the third-lowest average exit velocity in all of baseball. These guys love to hit a baseball so softly that the bat makes a sound like the snapping of a stale breadstick and the ball flies into the outfield grass at velocities that would not earn a speeding ticket on any interstate highway in America.
Who am I to judge? After all, it works: The Brewers today boast the best record in all of baseball. If their offense is broadly outperforming the quality of the balls they put in play—Statcast says their expected weighted on-base average on contact is fourth worst in the majors, and their team batted ball profile is remarkably unsexy—I am inclined to credit them with making some of their own luck. They&#x27;re disciplined: They see a lot of pitches, and they don&#x27;t chase, and because they&#x27;re very zippy on the bases they put a lot of pressure on an opposing defense. For a team like the Nationals, one that runs out a bunch of sad-sack juiceless pitch-to-contact bozos and backs them with deeply lousy defense, the Brewers are basically a nightmare. Well-placed soft liners accumulate at what certainly feels like an exponential rate, overwhelming your very sorry and helpless baseball team the way flood debris conquers the pilings of a flimsy old bridge.</span>

                              <span>A computer screen is a mirror, a conduit, a threshold, and a void. We peer into them for work, insight, entertainment, communication, companionship, and we peer for so long that the outside world comes to seem like an addendum, an antechamber of the vision granted by the screen. “The internet has many potentials,” says the Japanese master filmmaker Kiyoshi Kurosawa, “and one of them is this ability to amplify what’s inside us.” Any desire, impulse, resentment, or prejudice: Like the characters in those myths of self-obsession told around the world, we gaze into our reflection, and disappear.
In his new film Cloud, those who touch this void become it, a game of annihilation where everyone loses. At the start, Yoshii (Masaki Suda) is hustling a small business owner for the last of his merchandise. The man has a sob story—he invented a medical device and went bankrupt—but Yoshii isn’t interested. He pays bottom dollar for the last of the inventory, and packs them into a rental truck.</span>

                              <span>The Braves and Reds finally got back to baseball at the Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee, even if it took them until Sunday! Sunday! Sunday! The game was originally scheduled for Saturday, but it began to rain late in the afternoon. After a long delay and an aborted start, the “Speedway Classic” resumed at 1 p.m. today, and ended with a 4-2 Atlanta victory.
A record crowd was expected. There was pregame pomp and circumstance featuring both Pitbull and Tim McGraw. Then the weather kicked in. The game was delayed for 2 hours and 17 minutes while it rained. When it resumed, the teams recorded four total outs before the game was pushed.</span>

                              <span>The days of WNBA basketball in Uncasville could be numbered. According to Gary Washburn of the Boston Globe, Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca has agreed to a deal with the Mohegan Tribe to purchase the Connecticut Sun, and he has aspirations to relocate the team. I bet you can guess where.
Per Washburn&#x27;s report, Pagliuca&#x27;s offer is for $325 million, which would be $75 million more than the price for a WNBA expansion team these days. If approved, it would be the most expensive sale for a professional women&#x27;s sports team. On top of that amount, Pagliuca would earmark $100 million for a new practice facility to be built in Boston. The Sun would have their games in TD Garden by 2027, even if that meant spending the early part of their season in Rhode Island to get around any playoff schedules for the Bruins or Celtics.</span>

While Aces fans didn&#x27;t get much of a showing from the home team, they were treated to a better effort from the contestants of the halftime baby race.
The baby race is the best: a game in which confused infants attempt to crawl to a parent at the other end of a court. As halftime shows go, it’s up there with Red Panda, little kids playing basketball, and either of the two guys I’ve seen who balance things on their chin.

                              <span>Jerry Jones has yet to find a contract negotiation he won&#x27;t drag out. Since 2023, the Dallas Cowboys owner has run the same routine with star players Zack Martin, CeeDee Lamb, and Dak Prescott: Lowball, refuse to budge in public, then end up paying more at the last minute. This recurring saga livens up the period before the season begins, and it&#x27;s certainly more compelling than any of the Cowboys&#x27; recent playoff runs.
But this year&#x27;s edition, featuring Micah Parsons, has taken an interesting turn. The Pro Bowl defensive end chose not to drag out this process until the start of September. On Friday, he publicly requested a trade as he explained his frustration.</span>

                              <span>After the 2023 season, when the Mariners narrowly missed out on the playoffs despite having 90 percent odds of making it at the start of September, Jerry Dipoto traded Eugenio Suárez to the Arizona Diamondbacks in exchange for relief pitcher Carlos Vargas and White Sox legend Seby Zavala. The decision was, ostensibly, to trot out a lineup that struck out less often—Suarez&#x27;s 214 strikeouts led the league. A fine explanation. Without it, the trade would have resembled a salary dump. Unrelatedly, this was also the offseason when Dipoto set his famous goal of winning 54 percent of games in a season.
Never mind that strikeout rates aren&#x27;t correlated with raw offensive production. They certainly don&#x27;t look very nice, and why not build a team for aesthetics if you aren&#x27;t going to build one to win? If cutting down on strikeouts was the goal, trading away Suárez didn&#x27;t immediately do the trick. The Mariners&#x27; overall strikeout rate went from 25.9 percent in 2023, or second-worst in the league, to 26.8 percent in 2024, which tied for worst in the league. At least the Mariners have improved in 2025—their 23.0 percent is only ninth-worst in MLB.</span>

                              <span>Emmanuel Clase&#x27;s paid leave has screwed up some plans. The news that the All-Star closer is involved in MLB’s sports betting investigation “did not simply deprive the Cleveland Guardians of their top trade chip,” The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal reports, but also “ended any chance of the Guardians becoming a buyer.” Officially in sell mode, and without the guy expected to net a haul in a hot reliever market, the team flipped ace Shane Bieber to the Blue Jays and Paul Sewald to the Detroit Tigers on Thursday, and reportedly shopped around Gold Glove outfielder Steven Kwan.
Guardians execs were not the only ones with a lot staked on Clase. He’s one of seven baseball players who signed an agreement with the company Finlete, which allows fans to purchase shares in a player’s future earnings. The concept is a variation on the income-sharing agreements some young athletes sign to guard against career uncertainty, promising an investment firm a percentage of their future earnings in exchange for a cash advance. Big League Advance, now doing business as Big League Advantage, might be the best known of these firms: Fernando Tatis Jr. recently sued BLA, accusing them of using “exploitative, predatory business practices” when they signed him to one of these contracts at age 17. Overwhelmingly, the players signing income-sharing agreements are young Latin-American players, who are able to sign with MLB teams at a younger age and tend to receive lower signing bonuses than their drafted U.S.-born counterparts.</span>

                              <span>I used to run the following tally for famous people with whom I shared a birthday: Vince Vaughn, also tall, famously made a movie where Las Vegas plays a big role; the poet Ada Limón, not so tall, whom I only learned of after high school, not that my friends at the time would have cared anyway; and Lady Gaga, not tall at all (see: her documentary Gaga: Five Foot Two), famously one of the few pop stars who loves Vegas and seems to take it on its own terms. To this day, at the mention of any of these people, I mutter “Birthday bestie.”
I believe we are all linked in some way, but reality has yet to bear this out. Once, Vaughn was shooting a movie down the street from my job, but I never saw him. I’ve not met Limón, though I know other poets who know her. As for Lady Gaga, the closest I’ve gotten thus far was the second night of her Mayhem Ball tour, which started this month. I felt a thrill of vindication that she chose to start the tour here, though it’s not so surprising. Gaga and Vegas go hand in hand.</span>

The summer of 2020 was a strange one. I remember spending afternoons in a park by my apartment in Brooklyn, a park that had drawn circles in the fake grass six feet apart from each other. I saw friends there, sat on picnic blankets and drank out in public, and even got a ticket for it once like an idiot. It was a beautiful summer, as far as the weather went, and for every long walk I took, I could push down a bit of the existential paranoia that crept along day-by-day as the COVID pandemic raged on with only whispers of a future vaccine to ebb the tide of disease and death.</span>

                              <span>Breathtakingly unhinged baseball executive A.J. Preller wasted a lot of time this week calling every other dealmaker in Major League Baseball when all he really had to do was make one call to Minneapolis. Derek Falvey, the head of ball ops with the Minnesota Twins was clearing out his entire showroom, and all Preller would have had to do in order to facilitate his annual restock of the San Diego Padres was say, &quot;I&#x27;ll be over in 15 minutes with a tour bus. Pack lunches for everyone you want to get rid of and we&#x27;ll have them off the lot before drinks.&quot;
Sadly, it didn&#x27;t work that way, if only for efficiency&#x27;s sake. Still the deed was there to be done, and the gods know Falvey and Preller tried in their own separate ways to make Thursday’s MLB trade deadline one of the most ludicrous redeployment festivals in the history of human arbitrage. Both Preller and Falvey succeeded in their personal missions, but they got something like two-thirds of the league involved in the process.</span>

                              <span>I had an unusually hard time finding a feature photo to go atop this blog. Almost none of this is the fault of the couple of Getty photographers who hang around the Minnesota Twins. For one thing, I was on the hunt for an image of a player who is still on the team. But ahead of the Thursday trade deadline the Twins shipped out approximately 40 percent of their major-league roster, including nearly everyone of any present value, so the options were not great. For another—and I want to reiterate that I am not blaming anyone for this—photographers David Berding, Matt Krohn, Rob Tringali, and Brace Hemmelgarn show a strong preference for compositions featuring cool things happening and players being happy. I was looking for something that matched the vibes of what is left of the Minnesota Twins, but since I could find no recent images of Byron Buxton hitchhiking along I-35W, or of Joe Ryan staring at the horizon with tears streaking his face, I had to settle. That up there is the perma-crabbed Royce Lewis, looking ambiguously pensive; I am like 80 percent sure Lewis is still a Twin today, although he is never more than one misplaced banana peel away from a four-month stint on the injured list.
The Twins were not the only team that spent the past few days selling, but their version of selling was by far the most gruesome and dispiriting. They first entered the Deal Zone Monday, a rare early mover in a deadline that otherwise took a while to shake loose. Their swap of Chris Paddack and reliever Randy Dobnak to the Detroit Tigers for a surplus catching prospect down at the Florida Complex League signaled pretty definitively that the Twins would be parachuting out of the American League&#x27;s wild card hunt. The fire sale did not shift into high gear, though, until Thursday, when some poor social media person spent the afternoon firing off &quot;Thank You&quot; posts to just about anyone on the roster that president of baseball operations Derek Falvey could exchange for a reasonably fresh ham sandwich.</span>

                              <span>There is a worrying sense at the moment, present across a worryingly large swath of public life, that everything is shrinking. It is not a matter of any of those things dying so much as they are just kind of diminishing and getting worse, either out of simple neglect or as a reflection of cockeyed ideological preference or just due to your more familiar capitalist sadism. In your more speculative or spammy sectors, this is unsurprising; the people in charge of all that are not what you&#x27;d call nurturing, and get bored quickly. This feels and is bad, but it makes the few places where there is undeniable growth happening stand out that much more. In the case of the WNBA, which is growing fast and preparing to grow faster, it stands out doubly because so much of the discourse surrounding the league suggests that it is actually somehow in crisis.

Until baseball&#x27;s trade deadline brings July&#x27;s annual Month of Bargains to a close later today, we can all imagine what our favorite team is going to do in lieu of delivering any actual work product; this will keep us both frothily engaged and emotionally and fiscally tied to the teams that otherwise drag us down. We love when our team is buying and hate when they are selling, because one implies belief and the other despair. Buying rocks, selling sucks.</span>

                              <span>Brandy: This was my first read of The Art of Fielding, though I do have memories of it being like, A Book You Should Read back in the day. I’m not sure exactly what I was expecting but I found it quite winsome! It has an undeniable charm and there is a certain quaintness to it that I enjoyed a lot. Less baseball than I thought there would be, maybe. Am I the only one who was reading it for the first time? 
Maitreyi: I also read it for the first time! And I knew only very superficial things about it before—that it had to do with baseball, that it had been at the center of a major bidding war, and that it earned the author a big advance. It was a bit more folksy and commercial (in a good way!) than I expected. But it ended up being a book I was surprised I hadn’t read before, even if my feelings were a little mixed. Midwest campus baseball novel is very much my speed.</span>

                              <span>On May 11, 2023, Ellerie Ulfers was pitching for Washburn High School against district rival Southwest in a varsity softball game in Minneapolis, Minn. The start time had been moved back 15 minutes, to 3:45 p.m., to accommodate an umpire’s schedule. But Ulfers shook it off; she was used to pitching under pressure and in less-than-ideal conditions—she’d been on the varsity team since the year before, as an eighth grader. (In Minneapolis, since most middle school sports were cut due to budget shortfalls in 2015, middle schoolers play on high school teams.) The game was tense, with the lead going back and forth, and by the end of the sixth inning, the score was tight: Southwest 15–Washburn 13. 
But instead of getting another chance to bat and close out the game, Ulfers and all the other athletes were told to go home.</span>

Yankees shortstop Anthony Volpe has a problem. No one involved wants to use the dreaded Y-word. Yips are for Chihuahuas! It&#x27;s a &quot;defensive slump,&quot; according to his manager Aaron Boone. To Volpe, it&#x27;s simply &quot;this,&quot; as in, &quot;I’ve never really experienced something like this.&quot; What this is is a newfound and inexplicable inability to throw a baseball where he wants it to go. Volpe has committed three errors in his last two games to push his season total to 16, the most of anyone in MLB.</span>

                              <span>People are starving in Gaza. They are starving because the Israeli government is not allowing enough food to enter, and because what food becomes sporadically available can be claimed only by those willing to enter the death traps engineered by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an American and Israeli-backed private food distribution system. 
A recent report from the U.N.-affiliated Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, including data up to July 25, “indicates that famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of the Gaza Strip and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City.” Because this crisis is so widespread, it will necessarily impact wide swathes of the population. There will be Palestinian men, women, and children who struggle to meet their minimal requirements for nutrition. This will happen to elderly diabetics and pregnant women and asthmatic teenagers. The frail bodies of children with conditions that impede muscle development will become frailer. That hunger will come for those already struggling to thrive makes the situation more horrifying, not less, provided you are a person who has not systematically shriveled your own moral instincts down to nothing.</span>

                              <span>Perhaps you think that a rematch between two teams who played what might be the most thrilling WNBA Finals in league history should have arrived before the penultimate day of July. Sometimes it&#x27;s best for these things to simmer, though, and in this case the time away served everyone well. The 2025 WNBA season has had months to settle into itself, to surface compelling narratives and interesting players, and here at the start of the stretch run there is one story that matters more than all the others: There are two great teams in this league, and then there&#x27;s everyone else.
Before Wednesday night, the New York Liberty and Minnesota Lynx hadn&#x27;t seen each other since Game 5 of the 2024 Finals, which brought an entertaining and hard-fought series to a sloppy and somewhat disappointing end. They have since maintained their perches atop the league—the Liberty entered last night&#x27;s game in Minneapolis with a 17–8 record and a net rating of 8.2, second-best in the league. The Lynx carried with them a 23–4 record and a sparkling 13.2 net rating. The anticipation for this rematch was somewhat diminished by the absence of Breanna Stewart, who is out of the Liberty&#x27;s lineup while dealing with a bone bruise in her knee. But these teams are good enough and deep enough to turn any meeting between them into a spectacle, and that&#x27;s exactly what they did throughout Minnesota&#x27;s 100–93 victory.</span>

                              <span>Gilbert Arenas has really gotta stay away from any card game that ain’t solitaire. The onetime Washington Wizards superstar, who tanked his basketball career in 2009 by bringing guns to a fistfight with a teammate over piddly gambling debts, has been arrested again, this time for his role in an allegedly off-the-books poker operation. 
According to the Department of Justice, Arenas was one of several card players—including a man named Yevgeni Gershman, who the DOJ describes as a &quot;suspected organized crime figure from Israel&quot;—taken into custody in Los Angeles today for running a recurring high-stakes game of poker at a house he owned in Encino, Calif. Details in the DOJ&#x27;s release give the impression that Arenas was essentially arrested for hosting grim men&#x27;s evenings:</span>

                              <span>This week, Luka Doncic took part in a time-honored tradition employed by many athletes before him: a news cycle about how he&#x27;s in the best shape of his life. As the Lakers star made a trip to New York, showing up at Yankee Stadium and Dyckman Park to promote a shoe or whatever, Men&#x27;s Health published a feature on his summer training regimen. One specific detail about his physique sounded incredible, in the literal sense of the word.
The feature, co-written by Andrew Heffernan and Ebenezer Samuel, presents an inside look at how Doncic is getting lean and strong with his trainer in Croatia. You can probably guess where this is going. He&#x27;s not just getting up shots—he&#x27;s lifting weights. He&#x27;s working on his conditioning. He&#x27;s doing something with a resistance band. He&#x27;s eating better:</span>

After losing 12 of 13, Tigers outfielder Riley Greene shaved off his beard but left his mustache, and since then Detroit has won three straight. Are these two things related? Is the mustache winning baseball games? Who can say. One thing we can say with absolute certainty is that they are touching it, early and often.</span>

                              <span>The Boston Red Sox encountered significant turbulence on a team flight to Minneapolis Sunday night. Big deal, you are saying, from the comfort of your office chair. It is at least a moderate deal. We are not talking about the zippy little Space Mountain stuff that makes passengers giggle during approach. Passengers in this case were lifted from their seats and bounced around violently, and several people barfed all over the place. The flight had to make an unscheduled landing in Detroit, so unstable was the weather, and did not finally land in Minneapolis until around 1:00 a.m. Several Red Sox players were still feeling sick and beat up the following day, and reliever Garrett Whitlock had to miss the series opener due to lingering aftereffects. Two Red Sox players and one broadcaster called it the worst turbulence they&#x27;d ever experienced, per MassLive, and these are people who do a lot of flying.
&quot;Forty-five minutes straight of left, right, dropping down,&quot; recalled Lucas Giolito, who compared the experience unfavorably to a roller coaster. &quot;Sitting on a plane, it was like, oh boy. At one point, I kind of flew up out of my seat. I was like, &#x27;OK, it’s time to put the seatbelt on.&#x27;&quot; Giolito says he was comforted by the knowledge that &quot;commercial airline jets never crash from turbulence,&quot; information that he picked up from watching The Rehearsal, a show that I have never watched and that from my experience entirely defies explanation.</span>

                              <span>I just read Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s 1870s novel Anna Karenina for the first time, and I am treating it like a real accomplishment. For basically all of my life, whenever I&#x27;ve heard reference to Tolstoy—OK, mostly War And Peace specifically, but whatever—it&#x27;s felt like he&#x27;s been hanging high above my head, his essence incomprehensible to my less-developed brain. He&#x27;s so revered and so synonymous with supersized, challenging literature that he felt, basically, like the final boss of reading. 
What surprised me about Anna Karenina, however, is that on a sentence level, it isn&#x27;t tough at all. It was listed under &quot;YA&quot; at my library, sure, but I kind of thought that was some sort of trick to lure young people into giving a classic a shot. The language in my copy was so basic and so direct about what was happening that I actually looked up the translation to make sure I hadn&#x27;t accidentally grabbed some sort of &quot;No Fear Shakespeare&quot; version of the novel. (Apparently, Louise and Aylmer Maude were pals of Leo&#x27;s back in the day, so I trust that they were faithful.)</span>

                              <span>I can still remember the sound of the dull thud, and the scream that came after. It was a tournament game, and our pitcher, Paul, was dealing. He always did, because he could throw 80 mph as a 13-year-old, and he never missed the catcher&#x27;s mitt. Games with Paul on the mound were easy; I&#x27;d just stand at my position at second or first base and watch the strikeouts accumulate while feeling sorry for the kids on the other team who had to quiver through each at-bat. Paul was the best player any of us had ever seen. During this game, though, a fastball got away from him and sailed directly into the cheekbone of the batter, Josh, a kid we all knew and were friends with. There was a sound like a mallet hitting meat, followed by the muffled ping of the bat hitting the ground just before Josh&#x27;s body, and then the most upsetting scream I&#x27;ve ever heard.
An ambulance came for Josh (he ended up being fine, I&#x27;m not sure if he even broke a bone), and the game continued without him. Paul spent most of the delay crouched between home plate and the mound, his hat pulled down as far as it would go. Somehow he stayed in the game, and got through the next few innings while soft-tossing balls over the plate. Paul, who up until that point I could only perceive as a mythically good ballplayer, was scared. He didn&#x27;t want to hurt anyone else.</span>

                              <span>If you’re not a particular kind of mountain sports nerd, you might not be familiar with the Banff Centre Mountain Film Festival World Tour. But for people who live their lives in the overlapping circles of outdoor and adventure sports, environmental and conservation sciences, and nonfiction storytelling, it’s a touchstone. The parent festival has been held in Banff, Alberta, for decades—it will celebrate its 50th anniversary later this year—and the tour brings a tight selection of the featured films to more than 40 countries every year. 
Barring a true outlier like Free Solo, which made it all the way to the Oscars, getting on the Banff world tour is about as big as it gets in this corner of the filmmaking world. So it meant a lot when 600 people packed into the largest theater at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity on a Thursday evening last October to watch the world premiere of For Winter, a feature-length documentary from the National Geographic Society’s acclaimed Impact Story Lab.</span>

                              <span>A Hall of Fame case does not get built in the same way, or out of the same things, as a legend. There are plenty of Hall of Famers who managed to build compelling cases, in the methodical and accumulative way that such cases are built, without throwing off much in the way of mythos along the way. They get plaques, too, and deserve them. They also accrue the same, inevitable sort of legend that every big leaguer attracts on the way up; everyone who ever faced Scott Rolen in high school could and probably will tell you about the experience, just as my former coworker who once served up a 450-foot homer to Orlando Hudson in a college game would invariably bring it up when even a narrow window of opportunity opened. I should be clear that I think this is absolutely the right thing to do. Even …</span>

                              <span>When scientists discover new prehistoric species, the fossils alone fail to conjure the creature in the flesh. It&#x27;s impossible to summon the entirety ancient shark from a single tooth, or some weird old rodent from a fragment of a jaw. This is where paleoart comes in, with illustrations that help you imagine how such an animal might have looked in its heyday. But very few of these visualizations dare to take one step further and help you imagine what it would be like to be caught, swallowed, and digested by that animal—until now.
Imagine you are a small living creature or a scrap of a dead one, drifting in the shallows over an innocuous patch of sand. But what is that? Suddenly that dimple in the sand has unfurled into a daunting pillar of a worm. But it this is not just any worm; it is Kraytdraco spectatus, an ancient penis worm that lurked in the sludge of the shallow seas swathing the Grand Canyon during the Cambrian. And K. specatus is about to eat you.</span>

                              <span>Folks with fancy degrees will tell you that kleptomania is a mental illness, but I bet those doctors never watched a San Diego Padres game. On a couple of occasions already this month, Kelsey has covered how the outfielders of the Robbin&#x27; Padres so spectacularly take away would-be dingers from their opponents, almost like they have a compulsion to steal. And yet their victims persist in hitting balls to that area just above the top of the fence. The latest of these poor marks was the New York Mets, who traveled all the way to Southern California only to discover that their hosts were thieves who like nothing more than swiping taters while thousands of locals cheer them on.
San Diego&#x27;s big heist came in the fourth inning of Monday&#x27;s series opener—thankfully, well after any impressionable children on the east coast would have already gone to bed. Mark Vientos went the other way on some high cheese from Dylan Cease, smacking it way out to right center. But Fernando Tatis Jr. owns that territory, and if you want to do business, you gotta go through him. The SD star gathered, leaped high off the warning track, and stretched his glove over the top of the fence to reel back what had seemed like a sure-thing four-bagger. Tatis was such a stealthy, athletic robber in this instance that even Padres play-by-play man Don Orsillo had no idea what he did. First, he called it as a home run, and then when Tatis fumbled the ball on the transfer into his glove, Orsillo assumed Vientos had hit it off the wall. That&#x27;s the sneakiness of all the best bandits: They stay two steps ahead of whatever you&#x27;re thinking.</span>

                              <span>VARIOUS CITIES (SOME ARGUABLY TOWNS), France — The Tour de France is over. I hope you enjoyed the racing and the 11 dispatches I was able to bring you from the race, on topics such as how language works in the peloton, a day in the life of a neutral service mechanic, and Tadej Pogacar&#x27;s stultifying dominance. This is the last one before I go on vacation.
As I hope to have illustrated, the Tour is less a bike race than a rollicking circus that happens to have a bike race at its center. The bike race and the circus both matter, and I&#x27;ve tried to highlight both, though there were so many strange and delightful things that I saw, heard, and experienced that could not fit into otherwise wieldy blogposts.

                              <span>Defensive tackle Christian Wilkins was released by the Raiders last week, which immediately scanned as just another instance of the franchise deploying its &quot;trip over your own feet&quot; philosophy of roster construction. Yes, it&#x27;s strange to release a guy who you just signed to a four-year deal with $84 million guaranteed last offseason, but that&#x27;s how bad teams do business. 
Conscious of how a move like this would look, the Raiders had an explanation ready to be disseminated through various league insiders: Wilkins, who suffered a Jones fracture in his foot last October, was refusing to follow the team&#x27;s recommendation to have a second surgery on his foot, and therefore the Raiders were not only releasing him but seeking to recoup $35.2 million of guaranteed money that remains on his contract.</span>

                              <span>I am sitting on a dock in the Wisconsin sun. About 15 feet away, Livi Pappadopoulos and Aini Anderson are walking on water. The first and (now) second-ranked women in logrolling are sharing a No. 3 log (13 inches in diameter, No. 3 because it is third-widest) and a full conversation. &quot;Can I flex for a second?&quot; Livi asks. Aini says sure. &quot;The other day I came out here alone and got a little roll in on the No. 5, probably half an hour, and then brought it back to the dock and pulled it up onto the dock all without getting wet.&quot; Though the No. 5 is the smallest, not even used by pros in competition, it would still be about 270 pounds (when dry), round, and in the situation Livi is describing, also wet and slippery. None of that seems remotely possible. It does not even occur to me to doubt her.
I got into logrolling the same way everyone does: I was hanging out in the Midwest looking for a way to kill a Saturday. On this particular weekend, the La Crosse Open was happening, so I just showed up. It was a pretty low-key, casual affair. The spectators were mostly locals who knew someone in the event, or people who didn&#x27;t really know what they were looking at but were quite happy to have a beer and a brat while watching something cool for free.</span>

                              <span>A 32-point, eight-rebound, seven-assist, four-steal, two-block performance is just the kind of thing you can expect from Napheesa Collier these days. She began the year favored to win MVP, and halfway through the WNBA season, she’s done nothing to sway voters in any another direction. Her Minnesota Lynx sit comfortably in first place; their biggest challengers will have to weather some time without Breanna Stewart, who left a recent Liberty game with a lower leg injury. The Lynx are still a model of steadiness, able to overwhelm opponents with sheer precision on both ends of the floor. 
Which is why a 32-point, eight-rebound, seven-assist, four-steal, two-block Napheesa Collier performance in a loss at home is just not the kind of thing you’d expect from them. Before last weekend (and excluding the Commissioner’s Cup Final), Minnesota was 14-0 in their own building this season, a franchise-record home win streak for a franchise whose records are tough to break. But it came to an end Sunday in a 90-86 loss to the Atlanta Dream, who are finally, after many years, interesting.</span>

                              <span>A Gaelic football season of massive upheaval ended just like so many others had: With Kerry winning another All-Ireland championship. The recognized all-time kings of the game, now led by David Clifford, who at 26 years old is already hailed as history’s greatest Gael footballer, blitzed Donegal early and then fairly coasted to a 10-point win, 1-26 to 0-19. The triumph, coming in front of more than 82,000 manic green-and-gold clad fans who packed Dublin’s legendary Croke Park, gave Kerry their 39th title in a competition that dates back to 1887. No other county comes close.
The 2025 tournament was the first held since the sport’s sanctioning body, the Gaelic Athletic Association, installed several momentous rule changes in hopes of opening up offenses. The alterations included forbidding back passes to goalies, and also short kickouts from goalies. But the most radical of the new edicts, and likely the most radical rule change ever foisted upon Irish football (and one which indicates Steph Curry’s sporting influence transcends the USA and basketball), came with the addition of a two-point arc 40 meters from the center of the goal line. The new line, according to the godfathers of the nationalistic pastime, would prevent coaches from stuffing the area in front of the goal with defenders, and thereby lead to both goal-scoring opportunities and long, majestic shots from play.</span>

                              <span>On Monday, ESPN&#x27;s Jeff Passan reported, and the Cleveland Guardians confirmed with an official statement, that Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase has been placed on &quot;non-disciplinary paid leave as part of MLB&#x27;s sports-betting investigation&quot; until Aug. 31. This leave comes as part of the investigation into Clase&#x27;s teammate, Luis L. Ortiz, who was placed on leave earlier in the month after a betting-integrity firm flagged abnormal betting activity on two specific pitches he threw.
Clase, an All-Star and three-time American League leader in saves, has a much higher profile than Ortiz. His name has been floating around trade talks this year; as Bob Nightengale has helpfully noted, his administrative leave means he is presumably no longer on the trade block. A note on language: While being placed on leave resembles a suspension—the player is not permitted to play—it is, in the language Passan uses, explicitly non-disciplinary before the conclusion of the investigation. This is the same language used in league investigations into domestic violence cases.</span>

                              <span>In the current my-truth era everyone is not just permitted but encouraged to pretend they&#x27;re right whether or not they actually are. The deranged and deranging downsides of this are obvious and everywhere, but one of the smaller of those is that heroes are by now pretty much an eye-of-the-beholder thing. For instance, our Philadelphia Bureau is pretty in on Bryce Harper because, well, because he&#x27;s Bryce Harper. Even now, in a comparatively meh season—various injuries have led him to put up some fine if not quite Harperian numbers—he&#x27;s pretty much whatever you make of him, as athletic golden boys in their 32-year tend to be.
Unless of course he does something like offer to throw the commissioner of baseball out of the Phillies clubhouse skidding down the hallway face first, in which case Harper becomes not a hero or even a golden boy, but a full-on god. And we say that while being fully cognizant that the baseline for godhood does not usually involve bumrushing a 66-year-old lawyer out of a room as though he were just another loud and obnoxious drunk at a corner bar. Bryce Harper is a god, period, full stop, and we are not accepting countervailing views. You want to argue? Go get in a fight with your neighbor. He&#x27;s been tardy on the rosebush trimming all summer.</span>

I remember the smell of incense in the stifling room and the shapes of other womens&#x27; bodies prone on their multicolored mats, completely locked into whatever physio-spiritual ritual I had stumbled into. 
I felt uncomfortable with the amount of chanting we did, but I liked the movement in the class enough to come back the next week. In the 15 years since I took that class, I&#x27;ve introduced several friends and romantic partners to yoga and I recognize the look of intimidation in their eyes when they first enter a studio with low light and lofi beats playing.</span>

                              <span>CC Sabathia became a star in Cleveland, and became a champion in New York, and this weekend became a Hall of Famer in Cooperstown—but I will always think of Milwaukee. Possibly the greatest midseason rental of all time, Sabathia&#x27;s 17 starts that carried the 2008 Brewers to their first postseason in 26 years remains my byword for dominance. I will go to my grave swearing that his stretch was the greatest I&#x27;ve ever seen by a pitcher; I will brook no arguments to the contrary. Perhaps this is hagiography over historiography. Don&#x27;t care! It&#x27;s the Hall of Fame, not the Hall of Objectivity. Sabathia was a warhorse.
It wasn&#x27;t just, or even, about being unhittable. It was about Sabathia&#x27;s tirelessness—his sheer, sustained ability to take the ball and not give it up. He threw on short rest. He threw to the 27th out. He threw and threw and threw, as many as 130 pitches in one start, and then he threw some more. He strapped a big honking icepack to his left shoulder (Atlas might&#x27;ve envied its sturdiness) and then he threw again. He made it seem like dominance was a matter of willpower.</span>

                              <span>PARIS — Four hours before the final stage of the Tour de France begins, I walk the length of the last, newest climb on the race parcours. This is only possible on the course itself, as thousands of fans have packed themselves dense against the barriers, the lucky few enjoying cafe tables or spots inside second-floor apartments, the vast majority simply standing and waiting to see how the riders would contend with a Paris novelty: difficult racing. Two thirds of the way up, a group of singing French lads build to a crescendo before launching a baguette across the course. A corresponding lad on the far side takes a honking bite from the loaf, and ritually hurls it back, on and on until the baguette disappears to rapturous peals of joy. This is the Col de la Butte Montmartre.
Paris is always the end of the Tour, unless it&#x27;s an Olympic year, and it&#x27;s almost always a parade. Three weeks in, and every rider, mechanic, and sleep scientist with the Tour, not to mention its cheese-addled press corps, is exhausted and wants nothing more than to sleep for 36 straight hours. The final stage is usually a champagne toast on wheels, with the winners of various classifications taking turns riding to the front of the pack for photo-ops before the peloton arrives in the city and turns a few leisurely laps around the Champs-Élysées; then the sprinters duke it out one last time.</span>

                              <span>Before this year&#x27;s rendition of the Belgian Grand Prix, it was all feeling a little bit 2021. The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps that year was wet and untenable. With race direction unwilling to cancel the event, the cars paraded about for two laps under the safety car before the race was red flagged and never restarted. Officially, the race was logged as lasting one lap and under seven kilometers. The points finishers, led by Max Verstappen, George Russell (in a Williams), and Lewis Hamilton, received half of the regularly allotted points. In a sport and season with no shortage of farces, the 2021 Belgian GP still managed to stand out as noticeable clown show—yet more history for one of the most beautiful, legendary, cruel tracks on the calendar.
Four years later, and spectators were getting some unfortunate flashbacks. Rain was aggressively forecast throughout the weekend, which it is wont to do in Stavelot, Belgium. On Sunday, the Formula 3 feature race was canceled. Uh-oh. Then the Formula 2 feature race managed to run in wet conditions. Joyous days! Then race control repeatedly punted the start of the Formula 1 feature race. Uh-oh, again. Then the rain petered out, and then stopped. Out of an abundance of caution, the race started under a safety car, which led for four laps. By the time it pulled in, the track was already drying.</span>

Despite losing its first game of Euro 2025 against France, and despite an arduous run to the final that further extended into extra time and penalties, England held off the reigning World Cup winner Spain to lift the trophy thanks to a 3-1 penalty shootout win. It was the last gutsy victory in a line of gutsy victories, each seeing England down and out but never completely lost. The Lionesses are worthy champions, even if they only led for a total of four minutes in the knockout rounds.

                              <span>The new Fantastic Four movie came out this weekend, and both Luis Paez-Pumar and Lauren Theisen went to theaters to see it. Here are four thoughts that they shared about the reboot of Marvel’s first family.
1. This is yet another superhero blockbuster, but it’s nice that it’s more about space explorers than crime fighters.</span>

                              <span>PARIS — Tadej Pogacar rolled across the line atop La Plagne wet and miserable. The yellow jersey appeared to weigh him down, like a suit of armor worn to guard against heavy blows which couldn&#x27;t reach him anyway. His expression never shifted out of bland disgruntlement the entire way up the final summit finish of the Tour de France. With Thymen Arensman all but bleeding out a couple of seconds in front of a small group composed of this year&#x27;s podium, and a stage win hanging in the balance, the sport&#x27;s greediest winner sat there, indifferent. He had won four stages and built his Tour-winning margin a week ago, so what was the point of extra suffering? The race was over. What could have been gained from punishing his rivals even further? Why win more than necessary?
These are not questions Pogacar has even entertained before. Pogacar&#x27;s defining trait as a competitor—the aspect that&#x27;s made him not only a champion but the most feared rider on the road—is his insatiability. For the second time in his illustrious career, Pogacar has won two Tour de Frances in a row. But for the first time, the prospect of winning seems to bore him. &quot;I&#x27;m at a point where I wonder why I&#x27;m still here,&quot; he said after La Plagne. &quot;It&#x27;s been three very long weeks. You&#x27;re counting down the kilometers to Paris. I can&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s over so I can have some fun things in my life again.&quot;</span>
