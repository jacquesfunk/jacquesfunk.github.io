                              <span>Maybe this is my fault. For years, I&#x27;ve been begging Kendrick Lamar to lighten up a little. To stop with the hip-hop savior complex and the often incoherent political grandstanding. To stop treating music like a college level African-American history course and just enjoy himself. Well, that more or less arrived in 2024: the year of Kendrick Lamar. We&#x27;ve seen him battle and ultimately defeat Drake, put on for the West Coast, and work his way into being this season&#x27;s Super Bowl halftime performer. To commemorate all this success, he has released a new album, GNX, in a surprise drop over the weekend that appropriately sent the internet into hysterics.
In a bit of irony that I&#x27;m sure is not lost on Kendrick, GNX is a party record full of earworms and radio-friendly pop records that, on the surface, more closely resembles something Drake would release than the sweeping artistic statements Kendrick has become known for. It is a victory lap in album form, ostensibly a showcase of Kendrick relaxing and having a good time. But there is something a little too empty about it for comfort. To paraphrase his words in &quot;TV Off,&quot; there&#x27;s a few solid jams on this record but it&#x27;s not enough.</span>

                              <span>Hayfield High&#x27;s season from hell is done. The Alexandria, Va., school&#x27;s leaders tried adopting the winningest football program in the state from a school in another county and damn near got away with it. But Hayfield&#x27;s messy 2024 campaign ended last night, just one day after intrepid local reporters published text messages from the school&#x27;s athletic director indicating that Hayfield administrators had considered using &quot;homeless&quot; designations for out-of-district players in order to get around athletic eligibility rules.</span>

                              <span>As longtime readers of this website would tell you, wildfires hold a certain morbid fascination for the Defector staff. As observers of the ice caps and fans of &quot;going outside&quot; would tell you, the medium and long-term future will both be infernal ones. The more I learn about the theory and practice of wildfire combat, forest management, and the history of megafires, the more fascinated I become. A phenomenon that seems inexorable and fundamentally uncontainable emerges, through the smoke, as a far more subjective problem. This month&#x27;s DRAB selection is a famed nonfiction look at one of the most infamous wildfire disasters in United States history.
Norman Maclean published Young Men and Fire in 1992, 43 years after the Mann Gulch fire killed 13 wildland firefighters. From what I gather, the book begins with the disaster and radiates outward from it in pulses, getting into deeper philosophical territory yet holding true to the hub at its center. The New York Times review both refers to Maclean as a great artist and contains the phrase &quot;cornball pastoral,&quot; which makes the book seem like turf worth mining. It is raining all along the West Coast as I write this and somehow we have avoided a catastrophic fire season for the third year running, which would seem to make a book about a summer occurrence an odd choice for an early winter DRAB selection. Great news there, though: The book also seems to be about the phenomenology of death. &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of tragedy in the universe that has missing parts and comes to no conclusion, including probably the tragedy that awaits you and me,&quot; Maclean, who would die two years before the publication of Young Men and Fire, writes.</span>

                              <span>Wolverhampton Wanderers are a soccer club in sort of the same way that Silvio Dante&#x27;s Bada Bing was an adult entertainment concern; technically it is indeed part of that industry, but the real business all takes place in the offices in the back.
In Wolves&#x27; case, superagent Jorge Mendes is to the club what Tony Soprano was to the Bada Bing. Since Chinese investment group Fosun International bought the club in 2016, the Old Gold has seemed to operate principally as a clearing house for Gestifute, Mendes&#x27;s talent agency. This hasn&#x27;t been the worst fate in the world. After spending about a decade and a half bobbing up and down England&#x27;s top three divisions, with only brief spells in the promised land, the Mendes-puppeted Wolves quickly returned to the Premier League and have established themselves as midtable stalwarts for going on seven seasons now.</span>

Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! Before we get to all the fun stuff, I have a quick recipe if you need ideas for sides on Thursday. For medical reasons, my wife is on a low-histamine, zero-gluten diet (if you ever wanna lose weight, try being allergic to 70 percent of the nation’s food supply), which means that she eats a lot of sweet potatoes. This means that the rest of us in the family eat a lot of sweet potatoes, too. To liven up the proceedings one night, I decided to mash them up and bake them, with some (OK, a lot of) brown sugar sprinkled on top.</span>

                              <span>Have you ever found yourself reading an article, and needing to stop halfway through in order to ask yourself an important question: &quot;Wait a minute, am I reading some dumb bullshit?&quot; The question is not always easy to answer. If the author of the piece is a particularly gifted stylist, or adept at persuasive writing, you might find yourself needing to spend some time unpacking their arguments and deconstructing their sentences before you can figure out if you are indeed reading some dumb bullshit. Other times, the question is very easy to answer.
Here&#x27;s a tip that will allow you to immediately suss out dumb bullshit whenever and wherever you encounter it: If the phrase &quot;to be sure&quot; appears at the beginning of a sentence anywhere in the text, then it is likely that you have encountered some of the dumbest bullshit ever written.</span>

                              <span>This is the time of year when the best, biggest, and most ambitious movies come out. Not Oscar season, but rather that stretch when the halls of streaming services are decked with the brightly lit, thinly disguised advertisements that are the year&#x27;s new Christmas movies. There are more than 100 new Christmas films to watch this holiday season, and whether that number horrifies or excites you depends upon how much of a freak you are for the festive. Sabrina is proud to say they are a real Christmas freak, and this year they asked some of their colleagues to watch some of the most, uh, available new holiday movies. The second movie in our lineup is Christmas in the Spotlight, Lifetime&#x27;s adaptation of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce&#x27;s real-life romance.
Sabrina Imbler: Thank you so much for joining me in watching what might be the celebrity singer-celebrity athlete Christmas rom-com movie of the season. I came into this movie knowing a lot about Christmas, but relatively little about the real-life stars that inspired this movie. I would love to know how each of you started this journey. What are your relationships to Travis and Taylor and their love connection?</span>

                              <span>The NWSL Championship could not have worked out better for the league. The best team in the league, the Orlando Pride, beat the Washington Spirit, 1-0, in front of a sell-out crowd. Marta, the best women’s player in history, won her first NWSL title while her mother was in attendance for the first time. Rookie sensation and MVP candidate Barbra Banda scored the game’s decisive goal. It was a good day for the NWSL, and women’s soccer, but it did not remove the season’s blemishes. None are bigger than the pending lawsuit against the San Diego Wave and the league itself, which alleges multiple forms of discrimination and negligence.
On July 3, a former Wave employee named Brittany Alvarado went public with a statement on Twitter. She accused team president Jill Ellis and the Wave of fostering an abusive environment, and the NWSL of improperly addressing the abusive leadership under Ellis. The Wave went on the attack, denying wrongdoing and threatening legal action. A week later, Ellis made good on the threat, and sued Alvarado for defamation.</span>

                              <span>For everything astonishing about the average Saquon Barkley touchdown run, the most uncanny is how natural it all looks. It is not, of course; on the merits, and even by the absurd standards for this kind of thing that apply in the NFL and basically nowhere else on earth, it just does not really compute to see someone Barkley&#x27;s size moving through space with the speed and precision with which he does those things. But if the particulars don&#x27;t really make sense on their own, the little narrative of Barkley&#x27;s long runs is entirely coherent, just in the sense that they just sort of seem like what would happen when you hand a football to someone who can do all that stuff. They are dazzling to the point of being implausible, but they make sense.
There is a lot of meaningful context on both sides of the ball on all of these runs, and some broader and less meaningful historical context trailing Barkley into the huddle on every play. The Los Angeles Rams talked about bad gap discipline on the 70- and 72-yard rushing touchdowns that Barkley had against them in the second half of Philadelphia&#x27;s 37-20 win on Sunday night, and Coach Sean McVay was forced out into the more literary extremes of coaching syntax—crediting Barkley with &quot;erasing angles&quot; and the like—in giving credit where it was due. But even bearing in mind that none of it is as simple as it looks, it is astonishing how simple this looks:</span>

                              <span>The squirting cucumber Ecballium—not to be confused with the exploding cucumber Cyclanthera—is not a showy plant. It meanders on a vine on the ground, sprouting craggly green leaves and demure yellow flowers. Neither are Ecballium&#x27;s fruits memorable to look at; the pale, bristly green pods are around the size of erasers and dangle glumly off their stems. But once ripe, the fruits will burst at a single touch, jettisoning a gloppy stream of seeds that can reach speeds of nearly 45 miles per hour and land 30 feet away from the plant. Today, a new paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences explains the mechanisms behind the squirting cucumber&#x27;s fine-tuned ballistics.
The seeds of the paper were sown in the summer of 2022, when Chris Thorogood, the head of science at the Oxford Botanic Garden and an author on the paper, brought three mathematicians and one physicist to an unassuming patch of cucumbers. &quot;Cucumbers aren’t normally very interesting,&quot; Derek Moulton, an applied mathematician at the University of Oxford and an author on the paper, wrote in an email. When Thorogood bent down to squeeze a fruit, &quot;you could hear a tiny little squirt,&quot; Moulton said. But no one actually saw anything, leading Moulton to assume the squeezed cucumber was a dud.</span>

                              <span>Due to a feat of collective willpower this website is not a 24/7 Nikola Jokic propaganda outlet. The Denver Nuggets center is averaging 30 points, 14 rebounds, and 11 assists on 67 percent true shooting; he&#x27;s on track for his fourth MVP in five seasons; he performs so many spectacular feats on a nightly basis that he&#x27;s raised the standard for his own newsworthiness. It may then seem strange that we&#x27;ve opted to show you, of all things, a Jokic missed field goal attempt from Saturday night&#x27;s 127-102 win over the Lakers. However!
With just 0.3 seconds on the clock in the third quarter, Jokic asked his teammate Peyton Watson to &quot;put it up,&quot; pointing his finger. Watson obliged, inbounded the ball at head height, and Jokic nearly volleyball-served it the length of the court and into the hoop.</span>

                              <span>A few weeks ago, after a grindhouse 94-90 win against the Pacers, second-year Orlando guard Anthony Black was asked about his team&#x27;s defensive performance, and he provided a succinct thesis statement on what makes the team special. &quot;It feels good, feeling their frustration with each other,&quot; Black said. &quot;Just seeing the looks on their faces is definitely something we talk about. Pressure, relentless pressure. I think that&#x27;s what we brought tonight, and I think throughout the game that breaks teams down, and when they get to that breaking point, they break.&quot; In other words, to play the Magic is to feel pain, to squirm against a force that is trying to constrict you until you turn purple and croak.
And thus far through the young season, opponents have croaked. Orlando is 11-7, third in both the Eastern Conference standings and defensive rating in the NBA. In a conference otherwise populated by mounds of butt, the Magic are the one cool young team breaking out. While would-be contenders in Milwaukee and New York are slowly righting the ship, the young wingspan freaks in Orlando are playing the conference&#x27;s best defense by a whopping five points per possession and consolidating last season&#x27;s breakout campaign, developing into an ambitious team with a clear identity.</span>

                              <span>Welcome to Perfectly Fine Dinner Party Club, a cooking and hosting column from Libby Watson, who likes to throw dinner parties but is normal about it.
A quick thank-you to people who emailed me about bo ssam! I would especially like to shout out Jerry, who said the post inspired him to invite new neighbors over for dinner, which is just the most lovely thing I&#x27;ve ever heard. He also shared a really great recipe for a cucumber kimchi, which his Korean mom calls &quot;quick kimchi,&quot; that I will be making myself. I&#x27;ll share it at the bottom of this post. I also received a great email from Samuel, telling me to do as the Times recipe suggested and serve the pork with raw oysters. I am unfortunately a little chicken-nuggies-and-chips baby who doesn&#x27;t like seafood, but I will share his suggestion with you all so that it wasn&#x27;t in vain. He correctly advises that &quot;if you want to impress people, sit them down in front of a big table of all the bo ssam fixins and then start shucking oysters next to them like you run an ice bar on the bayou.&quot; Do the voice too.

                              <span>The New York Football (So To Speak) Giants still have that dawg in them, trust us. They&#x27;ve just moved on from the mundane world of victory and defeat to the loftier pursuit of indiscriminate shame-flinging. Nobody can rip them better or faster than they can do it themselves, and they added the magic ingredient of unbroadcastable profanity to make it stick. Having that dawg doesn’t necessarily mean it is housebroken.
After their weekly pantsing, a 30-7 loss to Tampa Bay that featured Tommy DeVito looking like the winner of a North Jersey Daniel Jones play-alike contest and the defense retreating early and often as is the Giants&#x27; traditional wont, several team employees lined up to gently debate the intensely personal art of observational quitting. That is, they started pointing fingers everywhere and nowhere simultaneously, with the attached benefit of piquant naughty words for added authenticity.</span>

                              <span>The Commanders had what looked like a choice match-up at home against Cooper Rush and the three-win Cowboys on Sunday—a gift of the schedule that could have been a get-right game after two straight tough losses to very good opponents. But rather than reassert themselves as the upstart team that impressed so much in the early part of the season, Washington spent a long time doing nothing much at all. As the Dallas pressure injured running back Brian Robinson and contained QB Jayden Daniels, inhibiting his ability to either look downfield or scramble, the score was a meager 3-3 at halftime, and with 11 minutes to go in the fourth, fans had just witnessed five straight punts while the Cowboys held a 10-9 lead. That&#x27;s when the game suddenly turned into chaos.
With a Dallas field goal off some good field position, a Washington fumble, and a Rush pass to a completely uncovered Luke Schoonmaker in the end zone, the &#x27;boys seemingly took control. Under pressure to score, the &#x27;mmanders found their tempo and took bite after bite out of the field until they were rewarded with eight points. On the ensuing kickoff, KaVontae Turpin muffed the catch, picked the ball up, and used a vicious spin move to open a lane that stretched the remaining length of the field. Washington hurried a field goal to cut it to it 27-20 with under two minutes to play, the Cowboys took the clock down to 40 seconds with a three-and-out, and so the Commanders had about half a minute and 86 yards to go for a miracle.</span>

                              <span>Who is the real Tottenham Hotspur? Is it the team that&#x27;s picked up five early-season losses in the Premier League, most recently and most ignominiously a 2-1 home defeat to Ipswich Town, the newly promoted Tractor Boys&#x27; only win? Maybe, but Tottenham is also, and perhaps first and foremost, a giant thorn in Manchester City&#x27;s side, and Saturday&#x27;s 4-0 drubbing of the reigning champions, at those reigning champions&#x27; home stadium, might be more representative of Tottenham&#x27;s potential and peak, if not their consistent form.

                              <span>Before Saturday’s NWSL championship-deciding match between the Orlando Pride and the Washington Spirit, Brazilian legend Marta reflected on her journey with Orlando, where she’s played since 2017, the club’s second-ever season in existence. As the only remaining player from that squad, she told Sandra Herrera that she’s asked herself, “Why? Why am I still looking to do something special here?”
The journey hasn’t been an easy one. The Pride had only made the playoffs once before this year, back in Marta’s first season in 2017. Despite star-laden squads led by the likes of Alex Morgan, Ali Krieger, Sydney Leroux, Ali Riley, and Marta herself, Orlando never could quite form a team greater than the sum of its most impressive parts. Until this season, that is, when Marta, Orlando, and maybe even the NWSL as a whole all found the success they’d long been working for.</span>

                              <span>Max Verstappen claimed his fourth consecutive championship Saturday night, at the conclusion of the Las Vegas Grand Prix. Verstappen came into the race 62 points clear of Lando Norris with three races to go; some truly improbable stuff would&#x27;ve needed to happen over the season&#x27;s remaining few weeks for Norris to complete the overtake, but at a minimum the McLaren driver needed to finish ahead of Verstappen in Vegas. He could not. Verstappen cruised home in sixth place, half a minute ahead of seventh-place Norris, who surrendered late and took an extra pit stop in order to pursue the point for fastest lap on fresh soft tires, his McLaren team having shifted its attention to holding off Ferrari in the constructor standings.
It was a somewhat anticlimactic conclusion to a championship chase that juiced up the middle third of a Formula 1 season that in its early stages looked like another dreary Red Bull cakewalk. Even as the McLaren plot-line fizzled and it became clear into autumn that Norris&#x27;s title hopes rested upon Verstappen&#x27;s car kerploding at some point and then continuing to kerplode on an almost weekly basis, there was still fun to be had in Red Bull&#x27;s mounting frustration and increasingly visible dysfunction. Then Verstappen had one of the most impressive races of his career in a soaked and chaotic São Paolo Grand Prix, releasing a lot of pressurized angst and giving his inevitable fourth championship its signature moment. São Paolo at least delivered the thrills, even if it all but ended the underdog charge that gave the season its flavor. A Norris win in Las Vegas would&#x27;ve prolonged the chase, but not for very long.</span>

                              <span>Some human bodies are not meant to endure a full 82-game NBA regular season. It&#x27;s not necessarily the marker of doom it may seem. Bill Walton never could, and he won an MVP award, a Finals MVP award, two titles, and made the Hall of Fame. Tracy McGrady, a fellow Hall-of-Famer, never suited up for 82 games in any of his 16 NBA seasons. Joel Embiid, with two scoring titles and an MVP under his belt at age 30, hasn&#x27;t yet managed it, and almost certainly never will. You can be a great player without ever exactly being an every-night player. Zion Williamson can still be great.
That&#x27;s the thing I keep repeating to myself, in the manner of one who recites comforting air-travel safety statistics immediately after having watched both of his plane&#x27;s wings shear off at 39,000 feet, when I read that Williamson&#x27;s latest leg injury has not responded as hoped to &quot;multiple treatments&quot; and that he is &quot;not close to a return to action.&quot; Williamson started the season with a sore left leg, and then on Nov. 6 he tweaked his hamstring. He returned on Nov. 9 and played well in a loss. Williamson says he &quot;felt fine&quot; after this game, but during treatment the next day he felt &quot;more sore here than usual,&quot; and was told after a checkup that he&#x27;d suffered a strain and would be ruled out indefinitely. It&#x27;s been two weeks, and now someone wants Shams to spread the word that fans should not expect Zion to return to the court anytime soon, despite several different attempts having been made at healing that hamstring.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s fun to speculate about bad team chemistry. Sometimes the sideline body language is revealing enough. Sometimes you get an uncharacteristically detailed and cogent Shams Charania report, like the one the Sixers suffered last week.

All things considered, the Towns-Gobert pairing was a pretty successful experiment, schematically and interpersonally. But Randle is a bit more dour than the man he was replacing.
