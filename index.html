                              <span>Being a prophet is notoriously a risky business. One needs no small amount of charm in order to win over the masses with a sly smile and a knowing glance. It is important to be humble and never boastful. They must overcome challenges that would vex simpler beings. Maybe more than anything else a prophet is nothing without wisdom beyond their years, a knowledge so precise that it seems touched by a voice beyond our simple celestial veil. To fail as a prophet is certain doom at the hands of the devout, but in success we are rendered helpless at their spectacle.
&quot;These teams are 2-2 in their last four matchups, and the Redhawks&#x27; defense looks good,&quot; Timothee Chalamet told the set of ESPN&#x27;s College Game Day on Saturday in Atlanta. Amongst a sea of fans and a collection of back-slapping Jos. A Bank suits, he continued: &quot;But I&#x27;m looking at fourth-year Bobcats quarterback Parker Navarro, 65 percent completion rate. If he can get going, he&#x27;ll tilt this in favor of the Bobcats. I&#x27;m going underdog Bobcats here.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Though neither is the other&#x27;s biggest rival club, Chelsea and Tottenham always seem to put on fascinating matches, at least for neutrals. Tottenham has the ability to play up to any competition—or, as it may be, play down to any competition; sorry about that jinx, Spurs—and while Chelsea has been on a relative tear this season, emerging as dark horse title contenders at absolute worst, the Blues are always good for some shenanigans. The two clubs clashing at this point in time, with Spurs reeling after a swift downturn in form following its statement win over Manchester City and Chelsea with the opportunity to get the Premier League lead gap down to four points following the storm-aided postponement of Liverpool-Everton, promised to be entertaining. What it did not promise but joyfully delivered was a mess slamming face first into a disaster.

                              <span>If there&#x27;s something I did not expect from this sometimes-unpredictable, oft-chaotic, and almost always-entertaining Formula 1 season in its last race, Sunday&#x27;s Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, it was a perfectly calm drive from Lando Norris. Entering the race weekend, Norris and his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri had a tangible goal in mind: Outscore Ferrari&#x27;s Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz by 21 points (or more), and the papaya-clad team would lift its first Constructors&#x27; Championship trophy since 1998. Given that Leclerc had a bit of a kerfuffle in qualifying on top of a 10-grid penalty for an engine swap, leaving him starting in 19th, this felt like a shoo-in for McLaren.
Then, as he often does in good and bad ways, Max Verstappen struck. This time, he did so quite literally: On the first turn of the race, Verstappen, who started fifth, tried to overtake Piastri in typical Verstappen manner, and misjudged his dive bomb, instead hitting Piastri and spinning both drivers to the back of the grid.</span>

                              <span>In the late hours of Friday afternoon the NFL quietly announced it was ending its investigation into the most recent allegations of sexual assault against Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson. Watson was named in a lawsuit filed in Harris County (Texas) in September that accused him of sexual assault and battery in October 2020 while he was still playing for the Houston Texans. Watson denied the allegations, and the league promised to examine the case under the NFL&#x27;s personal conduct policy.
&quot;The matter is closed,&quot; a league spokesman said in an email to The Associated Press. &quot;There was insufficient evidence to support a finding of a violation of the personal conduct policy.&quot;</span>

                              <span>It’s all even halfway through the 2024 world chess championship between reigning champion Ding Liren and challenger Gukesh D, as they fight for chess’s highest title over 14 games in Singapore. The champion Ding Liren, coming off a nightmare run of form in 2024, sensationally won the first game with the black pieces, before the 18-year-old phenom Gukesh leveled the scores in Game 3. The other games have featured both exciting and pedestrian draws as the play has lurched between sublime and ridiculous.
Let’s recap games 1-7 of the match, notating moves which actually occurred during the games in bold, and hypothetical variations which did not occur but could have in italics. If you missed out, check out our preview piece before we get started!</span>

                              <span>Everything about that fourth-and-1 play by the Detroit Lions against the Green Bay Packers seemed ill-conceived, starting with the fact that they only needed a field goal to put the game away in the first place. Even with the defense getting lit up, 30-something seconds should be enough to hold firm. And then there&#x27;s the fact that Jared Goff slips immediately upon trying to hand the ball off and nearly blows the play up. But it worked. Dan Campbell&#x27;s gutsiness prevailed once again.</span>

                              <span>Thursday night&#x27;s Warriors-Rockets game was a burly, cantankerous example of one of my favorite categories of regular season NBA game: the Double Desperation game. The way it was won, specifically the player who won it, makes the outcome feel more indicative than a normal regular season game. Let me explain.
The regular season is interminable and every team must manage its efforts in Winter to be prepared for the games that matter in Spring, and so not all 82 games are going to be bangers, or even enlivened by extreme physical efforts or bold competitive displays. The schedule dictates that a decent number of games with big rest or travel disparities will tilt one way, and so not all games will feel as significant for both teams. But winning still matters, and like its colleagues such as the National TV Showcase and These Guys Want To Kill Each Other and Check This Shit Out: We Broke Math games, the Double Desperation game is given higher stakes by its participants&#x27; circumstances.</span>

                              <span>Michael Koresky begins his 2004 essay on M. Night Shyamalan’s The Village with a question: Is allegory in American cinema dead? Koresky, perceptive in his diagnosis of the post-millennium American audience as a stunned and stunted one, entertained the possibility that a literate Hollywood cinema was waning because few adults in the country read. Twenty years later, I wonder if there’s also the added element that allegory is difficult to swallow, at once too obvious and too subtle, nothing we haven’t heard before and nothing we want to hear again. 
It’s a dangerous time for a critic, in the wake of an event as seismic as a presidential election, to engage with art when people are trying to inject meaning into cultural objects that don’t have any. This impulse is understandable; most reactions, as I’ve seen people reassure one another online, are understandable in the wake of a traumatic return to a worse status quo. But even that characterization, trauma, feels false, hyperbolic not because there is no threat to what is coming, but because the therapy-speak that saturates so much discourse does everything but engage with, even combat the thing that occasions trauma. To endeavor to create a substantive allegory out of the social and political elements that cause so much distress at a given time, whether the so-called Trump era or post-9/11, seems foolish, naive, but these are the same descriptors that have stalked Shyamalan’s career from the very beginning.</span>

                              <span>While I could count on zero hands the number of Chinese people I met in China who cared about baseball, I would need more than two to count the number of brick-and-mortar MLB stores I saw, simply by wandering around various cities like a normal human being. The first store I entered in Beijing explained some parts of this phenomenon: In China, as elsewhere outside the U.S., MLB is a streetwear brand, not a sports league. Subsequent research filled in the rest: MLB is licensed in East Asia by a South Korean retailer, which has successfully turned it into a billion-dollar enterprise in China.
This means that you can more easily find MLB-branded gear in more styles in China—handbags, puffer coats, eared beanies, puffier(?) baseball caps—than wandering around a city in the United States. The trade-off is extreme limitations in team selection. The streetwear brand&#x27;s detachment from the actual sport of baseball and its attendant loyalties has odd side effects: In two separate stores, in two separate cities, I encountered window displays of mannequins wearing both Yankees and Red Sox gear. In response to this phenomenon, Barry Petchesky, Yankees fan, offered the following comments: &quot;Oh [no]&quot; and &quot;They love that stupid heart shirt!!&quot; I think it&#x27;s a sweatshirt, Barry, but I agree with the sentiment. From Samer Kalaf, Red Sox fan: &quot;The duality / Of fan.&quot;</span>

                              <span>This season&#x27;s version of the Denver Nuggets appear to be a team constructed for the sole purpose of answering the question: Is it possible for a team with the best player in the world, having the best season of his career, to be kind of depressing to watch? Twenty games into the season, the answer is, &quot;Wow. I guess so.&quot;
The Nuggets lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers Thursday night, 126-114, in a game that neatly displayed the structural and spiritual issues that currently plague Denver. The Nuggets are 11-9 after winning a franchise-record 57 games last season, and there&#x27;s no shortage of explanations for the slow start. Nikola Jokic and Aaron Gordon missing games hasn&#x27;t helped, and neither has Jamal Murray playing like a whisper of his former self. Depth is an issue. The defense is an issue. There are a lot of issues. But in the wake of last night&#x27;s loss, all of those potential answers feel like red herrings.</span>

                              <span>It shouldn&#x27;t be a strange thing to talk football—like, really get after it, talk about it like you really care about it—on a sports podcast, and I suppose on the merits it isn&#x27;t. Drew, for his part and to his credit, is never self-conscious about it; he really cares about the Vikings like that, and he really follows the fine points of the sport like that, so this is a very natural way for him to talk and be. I am less that way, both because I care about my team of choice so much less and because football is a sport I&#x27;ve always kept at something like arm&#x27;s length. So it was strange, both during the recording of this week&#x27;s NFL-heavy episode and in listening back to the finished product, to hear someone who sounds so much like me so obviously enjoying Talking Football like this. Can you be highly interested in something that you&#x27;re pretty sure you don&#x27;t entirely like? Given how much I have written about American politics, maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that the answer is yes. But I think, here, the proof is very much in the podding.</span>

                              <span>Originally, when the Michigan Wolverines beat the Ohio State Buckeyes 13-10 and decided to plant their flag on the Buckeyes logo, I found it amusing. The fact that those Buckeyes who&#x27;d just gotten embarrassed decided to fight the Wolverines over the disrespectful gesture made me roll my eyes. You had 60 minutes to fight, don&#x27;t start now.
This feeling lasted until later that evening however, when I watched my beloved, terrible Florida State lose to our rivals, the Florida Gators. Which was expected. But when those Gators tried to plant their flag on our logo, I felt my blood boil. And when Florida State&#x27;s players started fighting to defend our field from desecration, I felt pride—although the team didn&#x27;t put up much of a fight there, either. But my divergent response to identical acts forced me to ask myself why I suddenly, hypocritically got upset seeing those Gators do what I supported the Wolverines doing. The answer is simple: It&#x27;s because this still matters. The game, the rivalry, the aftermath, it all matters, to the fans and the players.</span>

                              <span>In the impermanent world of sports you get not one but nine, 13, or eleventyjillion chances to make a first impression. This is because sports is all about the reset. Draft a star, trade a mope, fire a coach, sell the team, move the team, as many times as necessary—if you don&#x27;t like something about your past, change it. People will forget, even New York Jets fans.
This brings us to the new Toronto WNBA franchise selecting Tempo as its nickname, and the explanation as provided by its current marketing team. As it currently exists, this is among the most objectively risible nicknames in all of North American sports. It will change, of course, but we might as well celebrate it while we can.</span>

                              <span>For all the intricate sets that earned rookie coach JJ Redick tumescent praise, the confident protestations that this would be a different Los Angeles Lakers team, the relatively well-managed Bronny James circus, and another year of clean health from LeBron James Sr. and Anthony Davis, the Lakers are 22 games into the season currently looking, overall, like a slightly worse version of their derelict 2023-24 squad. Well, that whole-season view may even be slightly generous: On a narrower timeframe, they have looked like one of the worst teams in basketball for two weeks. In the eight games since L.A. has had to play real teams again after crafting a six-game win streak against the league&#x27;s dross, the Lakers are 2-6 and lost those six games by an average of 21.8 points. Congrats, JJ Redick: You&#x27;re only one game off the 13-9 pace set by the dearly departed Darvin Ham.
Wednesday night&#x27;s 134-93 loss to the Miami Heat was the Lakers&#x27; most embarrassing effort yet, though the team found it in them to author my favorite defensive possession of the season. Basketball wisdom dictates that defense is a collective endeavor, a postulate typically proven true by good units whose five players respond to each other and move in concert, or by bad individual defenders who can be singled out and, by their individual weakness, compromise the team&#x27;s solidity. What distinguishes this Lakers possession, from early in the second half, from the familiar genera of blown rotation-style errors is that its failures are genuinely collective. It takes five individuals each making a series of incorrect decisions in rapid succession to produce such an unintentional masterwork.</span>

                              <span>Lonzo Ball has been through hell. This is the very firm impression made by an ESPN story published Thursday and written by Ramona Shelburne and Jamal Collier. Ball has spent most of three years dealing with a persistent injury to his left knee; the knee itself spent much of that time steadily worsening. The injury was characterized by cartilage damage and sharp, overwhelming, hostile pain, the kind of malevolent invading pain that shifts around under the surface, expanding and tunneling and throbbing with its own vile heartbeat. Reading about it makes my skin crawl. Months and months of this shit. Pain that started with an innocuous jammed knee and then blossomed into a debilitating but fundamentally mysterious chronic condition, and which defeated several surgeries and thousands of hours of rehabilitation and physical therapy.
Ball had a cartilage replacement procedure in March 2023, and from that point forward his condition has been steadily improving. This was apparently a risky maneuver, and indeed his surgeon attempted to talk him out of it, on the grounds that it might not work and could even make things worse. It worked, or has worked so far, and Ball is back on the court this season for the Chicago Bulls (more or less; he&#x27;s missed 16 games with wrist troubles, and has played fewer than 100 total minutes), which is great news and a feel-good story.</span>

There didn’t used to be so many billionaires. I know because I used to keep track of them. My old man had a subscription to Forbes back when I was a kid, back when Forbes was a reputable print magazine instead of the empty branding vessel it is now. Every year, Forbes would publish a list of the 400 richest people in America. The Forbes 400. The Zagat guide of rich assholes. I read that fucker from cover to cover.</span>

If you haven&#x27;t had the pleasure: Fans bring stuffed toys to the game, and when the home team scores its first goal, they are hurled en masse onto the ice, to be collected and donated to a local children&#x27;s charity. It&#x27;s good vibes all around. Maybe not all around. 
Michael Misa is 17 years old and projects as a lottery pick in the 2025 NHL draft; some mocks have him going as high as No. 1. The forward received a special exemption to even enter the OHL before he was old enough, and was picked first overall there by the Saginaw Spirit. He&#x27;s shined, scoring a league-leading 25 goals and 49 points in 25 games.</span>

                              <span>There was plenty of eventful men&#x27;s college basketball on Wednesday night. Nos. 1, 2, and 5 all lost tough road games, Mississippi St. produced a statement blowout over Pitt, Texas eked out a nail-biter over N.C. State, and UConn got themselves right with a victory over Baylor. But sometimes a blog girl just wants to have fun, and for this reason we turn our eyes to College Park.
While the other major conferences were doing crossover events, the Big Ten gave fans a little early preview this week: Teams play a couple conference games, retreat for variety over the holidays, then return in the new year for the full gantlet. Ohio State, in head coach Jake Diebler&#x27;s first full season, is looking to shed its underachiever reputation with an experienced roster bolstered by a couple of key transfers. Maryland, meanwhile, is hoping that the arrival of top-tier freshman Derik Queen will catapult them back into the tourney picture.</span>

                              <span>During matchweeks 13 and 14 of the season, the Premier League partners with LGBT charity Stonewall for Rainbow Laces, a campaign to promote LGBT acceptance in soccer, both on the field and in the stands. In practice, this entails some minor cosmetic changes around England&#x27;s top flight. The league provides clubs with rainbow corner flags, ball plinths, as well as handshake and substitute boards. Most notably, club captains during these games are given the option to wear a rainbow-colored armband, which they are free to decline. This is very much a bare minimum campaign by the Premier League, and one that it has backed away from somewhat; per The Athletic, the league cut the funding of its partnership with Stonewall by about half last December.
However, even the bare minimum is too much for some, which brings us to Crystal Palace captain and England international Marc Guéhi. During Saturday&#x27;s home match against Newcastle United, which ended in a 1-1 draw, Guéhi wore a rainbow armband that had &quot;I ♡ Jesus&quot; written on it in marker (pictured above). In Palace&#x27;s next game, a 1-0 away win against Ipswich Town, Guéhi once again wore the rainbow armband, this time with &quot;Jesus ♡ You&quot; written on it.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve spent the early chunk of this NHL season disproportionately watching underachieving Eastern Conference teams play listless hockey in front of crowds that seem barely engaged. So the Minnesota Wild&#x27;s Tuesday night overtime win over the Canucks, against the backdrop of a lively lower bowl, was hockey heaven. Down 2-1 to start the third, a team that missed the playoffs last season and hasn&#x27;t won a series since 2015 improved upon the league&#x27;s best record with an equalizer from their big D-man and a last-minute game-winner from possibly the most exciting skater in the sport today. The intensity may not truly start until the new year, but this was as good as early December gets.
The first-period action started a little tentatively, but the Canucks used a power play to their advantage when a Quinn Hughes shot whizzed through traffic to get them on the board. The Wild found their response with a fast-break three-on-one goal off a turnover in the second, but Vancouver stole back momentum just before intermission when newly acquired scoring leader Jake DeBrusk tapped in a rebound.</span>

                              <span>My grandparents held grudges so well and so thoroughly that in the aftermath of drama, everyone knew the drill: the offending person or subject was no longer to be mentioned. This is obviously unfortunate. Lore and venting instead spread outward from each person to their own webs of acquaintances, but within the family, drama became taboo. This is neither healthy nor productive for nosy little punks like me. Fortunately for gossips everywhere, some families chatter a lot. Some even consult fortune tellers for life advice. Others simply deal with forbidden subjects in the the good ol&#x27; way: lying.
For the penultimate episode of season seven, prepare yourselves for a huge family lore drop. We&#x27;re going One Hundred Years of Solitude mode. This is a good reminder to us all that you don’t get to be old without collecting a lifetime’s worth of secrets along the way.</span>
