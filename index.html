I certainly could have slept last night—my excitement for the dream of interning here was outweighed by Amtrak-induced exhaustion. But unfortunately for me, Oregon State was doing something to USC on a baseball field. It wasn&#x27;t exactly baseball, not as you and I know it. What it was ... well ... maybe you can tell me.
It would have been OSU&#x27;s two consecutive squeeze plays, which made three consecutive bunts of what would be four bunts in the second inning—that was when I knew that I would have no escape to unconsciousness.</span>

                              <span>Spend enough time watching the best chess players in the world play, and even a chess amateur will pick up on something: Space is at such a premium in their games that any seemingly innocent, sensible move—sliding the A-pawn to the third rank to prevent the dark-square bishop from forcing check, burning a tempo to line your rook up with the opposing queen even though four pieces separate them—can be punished several moves down the line. The greats can project themselves forward in time and see weaknesses before they even begin to develop.
That is not what happened on Sunday when Magnus Carlsen lost to current world champion Gukesh Dommaraju. The former world champion played very relatable chess, by which I mean he committed an unspeakable blunder to lose from a winning position and then pounded the table in disgust.</span>

                              <span>Here’s a story in two parts, both of which will be crushingly familiar to you. The main character of our tale is Iowa (uh oh) Senator Joni Ernst, who held a town hall in her home state this past Friday. Ernst’s constituents at that town hall were vocally angry about President Trump’s massive tax bill, which passed in the House a month ago and threatens to cut half a trillion dollars in funding to Medicaid. People will die if this bill passes in Ernst’s chamber. When one audience member informed the Senator of this fact, she responded, with supreme Midwestern condescension, “Well, we’re all going to die.”
That’s the first part of our story. The second part is Ernst’s formal response to the heckling, which she recorded on her phone while walking around a graveyard. Take it away, womanboss.</span>

                              <span>The Kansas City Royals advised minor-leaguer Jac Caglianone, their first pick in the 2024 draft and top overall prospect, that he could accelerate his path to the majors by focusing his development on mastery of the art of socking huge dingers. I realize that this is pretty much exactly what every organization is saying to every player in the minors at every opportunity. I realize, too, that this is what the sport itself is communicating to everyone, everywhere, all the time: If you would like to play baseball in the majors, the surest way is by learning to wham the ball over that wall. 
Caglianone&#x27;s case is special. For one thing, the Royals have a profound need in their lineup for someone even remotely dingerish. As of Monday morning, Kansas City&#x27;s puny hitters have combined to sock just 34 homers in 60 games, by a hideous margin the fewest in the majors, and just more than a third as many as have been whammo&#x27;d by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Cal Raleigh, mighty sockdolaging catcher for the Seattle Mariners, has already clobbered 23. It&#x27;s not by design. &quot;There are too many good players in that room,&quot; said frustrated manager Matt Quatraro, way back in April, after his team was shut down by Max Fried of the New York Yankees. &quot;It&#x27;s part of baseball. They have to keep their heads up and keep going.&quot;</span>

                              <span>By sheer power of will, determination, and lots and lots and lots of money, FIFA is looking to turn the previously irrelevant Club World Cup into a quadrennial summer-time blockbuster. Traditionally, the event has been a global supercup of sorts, each year pitting the seven winners of FIFA&#x27;s seven federations&#x27; continental tournaments against each other in a brief, midseason contest that virtually nobody really cared about. This month will bring the inaugural edition of the new-look CWC, a 32-team behemoth that will cram an already over-stuffed soccer calendar with yet another competition that nobody asked for.
It will take a lot of work to make this tournament into something fans care about. For the players and clubs involved, however, there are hundreds of millions of reasons why they&#x27;re willing to cut into their already vanishingly small rest and recovery time to try their damnedest to win. In its effort to make this whole thing matter, FIFA has filled the prize pool with ungodly sums of money, enticing participants with lucrative payouts that can rise up to $125 million for the winners. That&#x27;s almost one Florian Wirtz, if reports are to be believed, which should ensure that clubs like Real Madrid—who just paid Liverpool €10 million to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold early enough for him to play in the group stage of the CWC—and freshly crowned Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain will provide a good showing.</span>

                              <span>I thought the game I attended last Tuesday was just about the smoothest basketball any team could play, when the reigning champion New York Liberty jumped out to a 22-3 lead on the Golden State Valkyries and cruised to a 95-67 victory. But I was embarrassingly, humiliatingly wrong, because I had no idea how much the Libs would step it up for Ellie The Elephant&#x27;s birthday on Sunday. For this special occasion, which was marked by the presence of mascots from all over the area, the Libs improved to 7-0 with a 100-52 demolition job on the Connecticut Sun. Because New York took the fourth quarter off, that final score makes the game look even closer than it really was.
The Liberty have been gifted a pretty chill schedule to start their title defense, and the Sun—certainly in retrospect—were the plumpest creampuff of them all. A dangerous team that gave the Lynx all they could handle in the semis last season, this year&#x27;s model lost basically everyone that mattered as the franchise explores a possible sale and relocation. The Liberty, on the other hand, only look better. Natasha Cloud has been an instant sparkplug and fan favorite at point guard; last week she took a bow for the crowd during a timeout after the video board showed her besting Breanna Stewart in a chopsticks-using competition. The return of creative sharpshooter Marine Johannès after a year away means more deadly spacing. Kennedy Burke, a bit player last year, has evolved into a versatile spot-filler who&#x27;s hit as many threes as anyone not named Sabrina Ionescu. Jonquel Jones is averaging a double-double for the first time since her MVP year in 2021.</span>

                              <span>MLB&#x27;s replay era has brought many annoying developments to the game, perhaps none more so than infielders keeping their glove pinned to every baserunner in their vicinity, knowing there&#x27;s a chance that an infinitesimal separation between foot/hand and base can lead to an out. It is effective, but the behavior is also vaguely narc-ish. It&#x27;s how a nerd records an out.
On Sunday, the Toronto Blue Jays prevailed over the West Sacramento A&#x27;s, 8–4, which is good news for the Blue Jays but even better news for George Springer, who in the fifth inning was the victim of some zealous defending by A&#x27;s third baseman Max Schuemann. With his team trailing 3-0, Springer hit a two-out single that scored Myles Straw and moved Vlad Guerrero Jr. to second. Alejandro Kirk followed that up with a double that scored Guerrero Jr.—the Jays were rallying, baby! Woo!—and advanced Springer to third. Addison Barger must have been licking his damn chops as he prepared to step into the box with two runners in scoring position and the score now 3–2. Unfortunately, Barger was banished back to the dugout because of Springer&#x27;s decision to do some ill-timed hopping on third base.</span>

                              <span>Mamta Patel Nagaraja grew up in a small town in West Texas, where her parents ran a motel. Nagaraja and her older sister were both fascinated by space, which felt like a portal into the unknown. &quot;There wasn&#x27;t much grass, but I would lie down on the concrete and just look up and wonder,&quot; she said. Nagaraja said she remembers looking up to her dad—who, at 5-foot-8, was not particularly tall—and thinking, &quot;When I am as big as my dad, I&#x27;ll be able to touch a star and grab it.&quot;
While Nagaraja&#x27;s sister eventually pursued other dreams, Nagaraja&#x27;s never wavered. Soon after starting college, she secured an ongoing internship at NASA, which, in the early 2000s, was the only choice for aspiring astronauts. &quot;It was kind of the Everest,&quot; Nagaraja said. &quot;If you could get it there, then you had really made something of yourself.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Swings and roundabouts: Max Verstappen&#x27;s meltdown in the closing laps of the Barcelona Grand Prix resulted in a catastrophic failure of race stewarding, but at least it was entertaining. Before that, Formula 1&#x27;s historical European triple-header was turning out to be a bit of a dud. Emilia Romagna featured one astonishing overtake and little else; in spite of hacky changes to pit-stop regulations, Monaco was so grotesquely unraceable that it nearly horseshoed around into good entertainment, if one enjoys receiving early access previews of hell. If races can&#x27;t even be salvaged by a close title fight between teammates, then who gives a damn about sporting fairness? 
It&#x27;s a bad sign for the prevailing discourse cycle to be about how to make the sport less boring. At that point, why not end with a bang? At least Verstappen is always willing to deliver on that front.</span>

                              <span>Jurupa Valley High School’s AB Hernandez won first place in girls high jump and triple jump on Saturday night at the California Interscholastic Federation&#x27;s State Track &amp; Field Championships. She also took second place in girls long jump, making it, overall, a great performance for the high school junior. After each win, Hernandez took the podium, received her medal, and smiled for photos along with her fellow competitors. She looked happy, because most people do after they win. As the sun sunk lower in the sky and the late afternoon turned into night, it would look to a casual observer watching on a livestream, which I did, like a typical high school track meet: the national anthem was played, there was a reminder about good sportsmanship, high school athletes competed in various disciplines, upcoming events were called out on the loudspeaker, and parents and friends cheered in the stands. 
Zoom outward, however, and there were signs that this meet was not typical. Hernandez had to share the podium and the spotlight. There was much more national coverage of the meet that would be expected, and online, discourse around Hernandez&#x27;s win would swiftly turn hateful. This is all because Hernandez is trans.</span>

                              <span>Playoff basketball is intense and complicated, full of minuscule decisions that can swing a possession, a game, a series, a season. But, at its core, it can be, and often is, quite simple: The better team tends to win more often than not. In the case of the Eastern Conference Finals, after some twists and turns, this axiom proved to be true, as the Indiana Pacers bounced back following a lackluster Game 5 to close out the New York Knicks on home court in dominant fashion, 125-108.

On a Saturday night in Munich, PSG shed off its demons, sure, but it also demonstrated what had been clear once it got over a rather desperate start to the Champions League: The French league and cup winners were the best team in Europe this season, the most dominant force en route to its long-awaited glory.

                              <span>A woman sued Pelicans power forward Zion Williamson on Thursday, saying Williamson raped her multiple times. She also said in the complaint that he physically hurt her, stalked her, and threatened to kill her and her family. The woman filed as Jane Doe in Los Angeles County Superior Court and said the violence occurred while she and Williamson were dating for several years.
The lawsuit listed nine causes of action: assault, battery, sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, domestic violence, stalking, burglary, false imprisonment, and conversion. A lawyer for Williamson responded by issuing a statement saying the allegations were &quot;categorically false and reckless&quot; and calling the lawsuit &quot;an attempt to exploit a professional athlete driven by a financial motive rather than any legitimate grievance.&quot;</span>

You don’t go to an M:I movie for things like “a coherent plot” or “fully realized characters.” You go for the stunts, for Tom Cruise breaking into a dead sprint, and for shit to blow up real good. Going by those metrics, The Final Reckoning delivers. I got my money’s worth, and then some.
But there was one extra draw to The Final Reckoning, which was that it was presumably the final movie Cruise would do for the franchise. After all, “The Final Reckoning” is right there in the title. Also, Cruise is 62 years old and surely hellbent on finally getting himself a Best Actor statuette before he goes to Scientology heaven. So it made perfect sense for him to bow out of this series while his limbs were still intact.</span>

                              <span>In quiet moments, you can almost hear the faint sizzling sound of AI corroding humanity&#x27;s capacity for inquiry and sustained, focused thought. The arguments against this—that the technology itself does not work very well, or at all; that the ability to reason things out on our own is actually both important for a healthy society and more or less the thing that makes us human—don&#x27;t seem to be working, and have barely registered. People ask chatbots or AI-larded search engines for answers to questions that chatbots inherently cannot understand, receive a confidently phrased but often luridly wrong result, and move on grateful for the convenience and exactly zero percent wiser for having done so. It is not just that the responses might be incorrect, although they really might be; it&#x27;s that asking the question at all seems only to make the answer recede further into abstraction. This is something that even the smartest people in the most specialized areas are experiencing, so you can only imagine how stupid the results might be when someone like me does something with it. 
Here is an example of this. An online friend noted yesterday that Google&#x27;s search delivered some surprising and hard to explain results on the question of what Sam Presti&#x27;s name is. This would not seem to be much of a question at all, and the AI overview&#x27;s answer seemed self-evident. Sam Presti&#x27;s name, it said, is Sam Presti.</span>

                              <span>The topic, in Defector&#x27;s internal chat, on Friday, was a ban, in the nation of France, on smoking in most outdoor spaces. How can the French—the French!—ban smoking? David Roth observed that &quot;this feels like one of those things that leads to a bunch of guys in day-glow vests overturning a police van&quot;; Kelsey McKinney said &quot;they&#x27;re gonna light the streets on fire&quot;; Barry Petchesky quipped that it is &quot;time for le vape.&quot; 
The discussion then drifted onto the topic of which world populations smoke the most cigarettes (the Balkans, apparently?). But suddenly, Slack warned: Dave McKenna is typing. This is the Slack equivalent of hearing the hiss of a burning fuse. Here, lightly edited to remove various lols and feeble attempts at returning to the subject of world smoking habits, is what ensued.</span>

Since then, the A’s have clarified their position. And by &quot;clarified their position,&quot; we mean &quot;challenged the Colorado Rockies for the title of worst baseball team on earth.&quot; The A’s are back in their customary spot as a readily visible example of an organization loathing everything it inadvertently represents, and The Hunny Club has solidified its hold on Yolo’s hearts, if only because of the acronym.</span>

                              <span>John Laurinaitis has pulled off a twist worthy of his time as on-screen GM of WWE Monday Night Raw. That is, it was very obviously coming well before it happened. WWE’s former head of talent relations has been dropped as a co-defendant in Janel Grant’s sex trafficking lawsuit accusing Vince McMahon of gross sexual acts. Representatives for Grant and Laurinaitis announced a settlement-cooperation deal earlier this week; a statement said Laurinaitis will provide “evidence” against McMahon.
“His agreement to a confidential settlement is a pivotal next step toward holding McMahon and WWE accountable and bringing justice to Ms. Grant after years of sexual abuse and trafficking,” representatives for Grant and Laurinaitis said in the joint statement. “Mr. Laurinaitis looks forward to moving on with his life.”</span>

                              <span>My first favorite search engine was Lycos. Why? There’s no single explanation. I know it had a dog logo, which very possibly made a positive impression on my younger self. It had an exotic-sounding name, so that was a point in its favor. But I just felt like it fit my vibe. AOL? We didn&#x27;t pay for that. Ask Jeeves? OK, boomer (is what I would have said if I was sassy and/or prescient). Alta Vista? Yahoo? (Apologies—Yahoo!?) I dunno; they weren&#x27;t for me.
In some small way, there was some identity-making going on. But nothing that happened on a computer at that time felt very consequential to me. What were computers for, after all? I didn&#x27;t really play video games, aside from a brief phase of getting pretty into Civilization (I or II or III? I have no idea). I remember a cousin showing me Myst and being impressed but confused; I remember playing Doom, probably with a sibling or a neighbor. But all of the stuff that happened on the computer seemed a little pointless, a little dull, a little like work. Observationally, people used it to stare at spreadsheets, and to write stuff. (Lame!) Games were on disks (actual floppies, nominal floppies, or CD-ROMs). Otherwise, it was just a boring work box.</span>

My home is full of books. Because I am able to justify it as “supporting the local bookstore” and “keeping my own career afloat,” I am constantly buying books.

                              <span>Late in the New York Knickerbockers&#x27; conprehensive but semi-drab 111–94 beating of the Indiana Pacers, TNT analyst Stan Van Gundy took his inner grump for one final walk around the broadcast by saying something along the lines of, After Game 4, people were asking why Jalen Brunson couldn&#x27;t be a little more like Tyrese Haliburton, and after Game 5 they&#x27;ll be asking why Tyrese Haliburton couldn&#x27;t be a little bit more like Jalen Brunson.
It was, yes, another lament about who the next face of the NBA&#x27;s Eastern Conference would be, because the game itself carried so little entertainment. In fairness, the first four games had been excellent and Game 4 preposterously so, thus Game 5 would have to suffer by comparison. That the margin of fun between the two was this large, though, came as a bit of an annoyance to Van Gundy, and to be sure nearly anyone not sitting courtside at Madison Square Garden. Frankly, the biggest moment in Knicks–Pacers was when Peter DeBoer hooked goaltender Jake Oettinger after eight minutes in Dallas&#x27; 6-3 series-killing loss to Edmonton.</span>

                              <span>Drew and I agreed before Memorial Day weekend that it was time for a Just The Two Of Us episode of The Distraction, but it wasn&#x27;t until much closer to recording it that we decided what kind of episode that would be. There is more than one kind of those, and while we were probably due for one of the loopy, pre-vacation, Oops! All Digressions episodes, there is a whole long summer ahead of us to fill with those, and still some really good playoff basketball happening. Between the fact of that dwindling season and Drew&#x27;s latter-day return to NBA fandom, the decision was decently easy. It&#x27;s a just-us episode, but this one is also About Sports.</span>

                              <span>Late in the second set of his matchup with French doubles specialist Pierre-Hugues Herbert, 18-year-old Brazilian player João Fonseca scored a point to even the tenth game of the set at 30–all. &quot;Scored&quot; is the most active verb I can use there, as the exchange only ended when Herbert dumped an unthreatening rally ball into the net. Yet Fonseca erupted into a celebration, conducting the crowd into a froth, asking for more energy, more pressure. It was like stepping to the free-throw line and cupping a hand to one&#x27;s ear for more noise.
Fonseca lost that game, though he won the set in a tiebreak, then took the third set, 6–4, to move on to the third round of the French Open. There is a lot to love about Fonseca, the ebullient princeling of men&#x27;s tennis. To me, the most striking thing about the Fonseca experience, more than the actual striking itself, is his relationship with pressure. He doesn&#x27;t shy from it; he courts it. He doesn&#x27;t wilt; he locks in. Fonseca demands attention, and he performs, displaying a magnetic brand of confidence in his equally magnetic game. I can&#x27;t look away.</span>

                              <span>Becca Beckham grew up around the South in a military family. Beckham&#x27;s family moved every two to four years, and she grew up, she says, with public service in her heart. &quot;The military really shaped my family, and I appreciate everything that it&#x27;s done,&quot; she said. &quot;But I knew in my heart that that is not the path that I wanted to take.&quot; 
Beckham always knew she wanted to experience more of the United States. In college, she became interested in the Peace Corps, and then AmeriCorps—the federal agency that organizes community service across the nation. &quot;It&#x27;s this vague, big thing that a lot of people have heard of, but they&#x27;re not necessarily sure what it does,&quot; Beckham said. AmeriCorps, envisioned as the national version of the Peace Corps, was created in 1993 under President Bill Clinton. The agency offers people opportunities to serve communities across the U.S., addressing needs such as education, disaster response, and public health. Beckham joined an AmeriCorps program that led a team of 10 people around the nation for a year, working on disaster relief efforts in Missouri, Colorado, Texas, Alabama, and New York.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;d say it had to be Carter Verhaeghe, and in fact it was, but to give him the full credit for yet another heartbreaking playoff goal would obscure the effort of Aleksander Barkov, who deserves the majority of the applause for the late game-winner in the Panthers&#x27; series clincher against the Hurricanes. Thanks to this pair, Florida is heading to the Stanley Cup Final for the third straight year. And they&#x27;ve made it this far looking just as tough, nasty, and talented—if not even more so.
Hurricanes fans couldn&#x27;t have had much hope after their team went down three games to none, but the next four periods of hockey might have shown them, briefly, a glimmer of light. There was the shutout win on Monday to start, and then on Wednesday, Sebastian Aho managed to beat Sergei Bobrovsky twice in the first period for a 2-0 lead. That early advantage wasn&#x27;t enough, though. Florida hit them with three goals in the middle of the second period, and after Seth Jarvis struck back to tie it for the home team in the third, Verhaeghe silenced the Carolina crowd for the summer.</span>

                              <span>The other day, bemoaning the state of his WNBA fantasy team bench, my colleague Jasper mentioned that he’d just picked up a player he’d never heard of: someone named &quot;K. Westbeld,&quot; with no photo. This was more or less how the real Phoenix Mercury conducted their offseason business. The team has not owned its first-round pick in five straight drafts. To construct the new “big three” of Kahleah Copper, Alyssa Thomas and Satou Sabally, Phoenix dealt away virtually every other rotation role player they had. Basketball teams tend to have more than three players on them. So began an offseason scrounge through the photoless. 
But don’t judge a player by her lack of photo! Two weeks into the WNBA season, the Mercury are one of the most fun teams to watch, in large part thanks to international scouting finds the average WNBA fan had not heard of before now. In Kathryn Westbeld—and fellow new signings Monique Akoa Makani, Kitija Laksa and Lexi Held—the Mercury have some real role-player gems. They defend, pass, shoot, and generally make good decisions. At home against the Sky on Tuesday, they led the team to a 94-89 win after trailing by 16 in the third. An incredible fourth quarter saw Laksa, Akoa Makani and Westbeld combine for six threes.</span>

                              <span>When the nervous peloton began their long, slow ascent up out of the Adda River valley to Bormio to finish Stage 17 of the Giro d&#x27;Italia, I thought Isaac Del Toro was cooked. The 21-year-old Mexican rider had put up an admirable fight for the first 16 stages of the Giro, and though he&#x27;d clung on to the maglia rosa leader&#x27;s jersey longer than anyone expected he&#x27;d be able to, third weeks of Grand Tours are unforgiving, especially for a young rider who has never faced the pressure of defending a leader&#x27;s jersey before. 
One day earlier, Del Toro cracked on the San Valentino, losing over 90 seconds to the hardened Richard Carapaz and the moderately hardened Simon Yates; one climb earlier, Carapaz and Yates made him quiver. It stood to reason that Del Toro&#x27;s infirmity would compound, and the veterans would do him the courtesy of easing the pain of carrying the jersey. Instead, he seized the initiative and smoked everyone to win his first Grand Tour stage in style.</span>

                              <span>Like brother Magary, I have been re-energized as a fan by this year’s NBA playoffs, although I do admit that watching Jayson Tatum take one of Paris’s arrows harshed my mellow considerably—classical allusion courtesy of the Society of Jesus, circa 1974. It  was partly un-harshed by the emergence of Luke Kornet, Force of Nature. But, otherwise, it has been a voyage of discovery. I knew Anthony Edwards because my friend Tom Crean had recruited him at Georgia, but Jaden McDaniels was a complete mystery to me. I couldn’t keep Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic straight for the longest time. Tyrese Haliburton might have been the lead singer for the Spinners for all I knew.

                              <span>Credit where credit is due: USA Today sports columnist Christine Brennan has tried very hard to establish herself as the nation&#x27;s foremost Caitlin Clark alarmist. Whenever something routine for a pro athlete happens to the Indiana Fever&#x27;s star, Brennan&#x27;s job is to turn it into a matter of existential concern for the WNBA, a league that has 12 other teams. This week&#x27;s news provided another opportunity. Crisis alert: Caitlin Clark has strained her quad. Can women&#x27;s basketball as a whole possibly soldier on?
The tone of Brennan&#x27;s latest column might mislead the reader into thinking that Caitlin Clark has died. In reality, the Fever guard is only sidelined for at least a couple of weeks; after Tuesday&#x27;s practice she was casually putting up three-pointers. In Brennan&#x27;s reality, this is a recession-level event for the WNBA:</span>

But Skinner owns, for now, the Stanley Cup fate of the Edmonton Oilers, and by extension the possibility that a Canadian team might win it all for the first time since 1993. As the Oilers&#x27; goaltender he has defined both the glories and horrors of being an Oil fan, because there is never a guarantee of what level of quality he will provide.</span>

The inane thoughts that make their way from Trump&#x27;s obviously diminished mind onto his Playskool social media platform should not demand the attention of any right-thinking Americans, and yet in this case the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) snapped to attention, rewriting its qualification rules in an attempt to appease those behind what&#x27;s become a national hate campaign directed at a 16-year-old high school student.
The student Trump was referring to in his post is named AB Hernandez. She is set to compete in the high jump, triple jump, and long jump at the state championships, and she has spent the past few months being harassed by a local group of bigots. This group is led by Sonja Shaw and Jessica Tapia, both members of the Save Girls Sports association. Shaw is currently running for California superintendent of public instruction, and Tapia was recently fired from her teaching position at Hernandez&#x27;s high school for refusing to respect trans and nonbinary students&#x27; pronouns. At a qualification meet earlier this month, Tapia and Shaw led a group that spent hours heckling and harassing Hernandez as she competed.</span>

                              <span>Junior high is tough for everyone. Shifting friendships! Being stuck somewhere between childhood and adolescence! All those hormones! If you’re lucky, you don’t also have to manage a parent who thinks they can backseat-drive you through all the challenges that come with being 13. 
This week, we’re off to a prestigious private school in the West Village, where our friend-of-a-friend Ellen will have to figure out how involved she wants to get in her daughter’s 8th-grade fundraising competition. Unfortunately, it seems like Ellen’s mom-nemesis, Hazel, has no intention of playing by the rules. Would it be moral to just let Hazel get away with that?</span>

                              <span>The pattern was: The New York Knicks would scramble the length of the floor in desperation—frantic, wide-eyed, bolts rattling loose, spotting passing and dribbling lanes just as they snapped shut—in search of a bucket. When they got one, it scanned most credibly as an accident. Then, whether the Knicks got one or not, the Indiana Pacers would breeze unimpeded the other way and Tyrese Haliburton would create a wide-open, high-value shot for himself or somebody else within seven seconds. That pattern leads where anybody would expect it to go. The Pacers won Game 4 of the Eastern conference final Tuesday night, 130–121, and now lead the series three games to one.
When the Pacers wasted any tightly distributed handful of the approximately infinite good looks they enjoyed on the night, the Knicks could hang around, aided by 39 free-throw attempts and an unaccountable second-quarter stretch in which they wiped away a 10-point deficit and took a one-point lead with Delon Wright on the floor and Jalen Brunson off it. (Wright found time to commit a double-dribble violation in there, and played a shade under two minutes in the second half.) But the Pacers never relented so long that they couldn&#x27;t just breeze back out to a multi-possession lead with 90 seconds of focus once they locked back in. Haliburton in particular delivered what&#x27;s probably, given the circumstances, the best game of his career so far: 32 points, 15 assists, 12 rebounds, four steals, and not a single turnover, despite doing the vast bulk of Indiana&#x27;s ball-handling and creating over his 38 minutes. Even as his shooting cooled off after a bonkers first quarter, he maintained Indiana&#x27;s lunatic pace, kept the buzzsaw whirring, and sectioned New York&#x27;s defense to toothpicks.</span>

                              <span>Let us approach Shohei Ohtani as naively as possible, while admitting that in the case of Ohtani this decision can hardly be anything but a ruse. For the span of time that he has been on the Los Angeles Dodgers, Ohtani has been a designated hitter, and a very good one: He won the MVP last year in spite of being a designated hitter, and this year has been, depending on how you count, either the second- or third-best offensive player in MLB. The best is Aaron Judge, who is doing Aaron Judge things; the other second- or third-best player is, naturally, Ohtani&#x27;s teammate Freddie Freeman; Ohtani currently has both of them, as well as every other player in MLB, beat on home run tally.
Here is what that looks like over the course of a long weekend. The Dodgers came into it in a bit of a mire: a four-game loss streak, followed by a three-game win streak, followed in turn by another loss. Then their designated hitter opened up the final game of their series against the New York Mets by doing this:</span>

                              <span>The Florida Panthers, as terrifying a hockey team as they are, have made a bit of a habit out of elongating their playoff series. Take their slow start in Toronto last round, or the three they lost while up 3-0 to the Oilers last Stanley Cup Final. In all likelihood, their shutout loss on Monday night will be just another snooze button. But after a trio of wins in the Eastern Conference Final where the Panthers used the Hurricanes like a bonfire does newspaper, the Canes earned at least one victory to hang their helmets on. If nothing else from this series goes Carolina&#x27;s way—and so far, it hasn&#x27;t—they&#x27;ll at least have the excellent stretch of hockey that eventually delivered the game-winner in Game 4.
This action was tense until a pair of empty-netters carried the Hurricanes to a 3-0 final. But Carolina did a spectacular job limiting the defending champions&#x27; chances on net. Keeping the ice tilted has been the team&#x27;s personal path to victory year after year, but against the fury, physicality, and plain old talent of Florida, the Canes shrunk into something unrecognizable as they lost three games by a combined score of 16-4. Here, however, the team out-efforted the Pants, particularly from the midpoint of the first period through a Carolina penalty late in the second. In that time, Florida produced absolutely nothing of note on offense and relied on Sergei Bobrovsky to be tidy in goal. At 0-0 with the clincher in sight, Florida might still have felt fairly comfortable, but it was Logan Stankoven who ensured that his Hurricanes&#x27; momentum would not go wasted.</span>

                              <span>The end of this clip is why Paul Maurice is the greatest coach of all time in any sport, in one specific category: lectern domination. The whole thing is worth a watch, as all his pressers are, pregame, postgame or even off-day, but the last 10 seconds are killer, especially if you keep in mind that his team just lost a chance to clinch a trip to the Stanley Cup Final by playing a game he admitted he &quot;didn&#x27;t like.&quot;

                              <span>I went into Overcompensating knowing very little, except that it was a vehicle for comic Benito Skinner. I know Skinner, like most people know him, through his @bennydrama7 Instagram account. He started it while still a high school student in Ohio—seven was the number on his football jersey—but only began posting his celebrity impressions and campy sketches as a college student at Georgetown. I specifically know him for one of my favorite bits of satire ever. I cannot for the life of me find it anymore, and my description won&#x27;t do it justice, but it&#x27;s basically Skinner parodying the work of Brampton bard Rupi Kaur—no one calls her that; all you need to know is that she&#x27;s an extremely famous extremely terrible Instagram poet (example: “a man who cries – a gift”) who comes from a town near e…</span>

                              <span>At some point near the start of the fourth quarter of Game 4 of the Western Conference Final, in which the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 128-126, a thought occurred to me: These teams are playing too hard. It just didn&#x27;t seem possible that an NBA game could withstand that much sustained frenzy and focus from its participants. I had a vision of several players suddenly collapsing on the floor, all of their mental and physical energy spent. I saw the fans in the arena becoming nauseous, unable to safely metabolize the potency of the basketball that was unfolding before them. Adam Silver was going to rush the court and put a stop to everything. No, no, you can&#x27;t do this, he&#x27;d shout. You&#x27;re going to ruin the rest of the games.
Monday&#x27;s game was unquestionably the best we&#x27;ve had so far in these playoffs. That&#x27;s an achievement in and of itself, considering how inert this series felt after the first two games, in which the Thunder seemingly established themselves as several classes above their opponent. But Minnesota caught Oklahoma City with all sorts of haymakers in Game 3, winning that one by 42, and so they came into Game 4 at the very least convinced that they could stand and trade. What resulted from that belief meeting the Thunder&#x27;s resolve to avenge the embarrassment of Game 3 was a game that reached and stayed at the highest levels of intensity for 48 minutes.</span>

                              <span>If Natasha Cloud has stopped smiling at all since mid-March, she has done so only in the privacy of her own home. She beamed when she met Ellie the Elephant at Liberty training camp last month. She and Breanna Stewart laughed it up on Cloud’s Instagram stories during a recent team excursion to Yankee Stadium. After New York’s home opener against the Aces, the crowd cheered at the sight of Cloud’s happy face on the jumbotron; she finished with 22 points, six rebounds and nine assists.
And can you blame her for smiling through it all, in disbelief of her life? The trade that sent her from Phoenix to Connecticut in exchange for Alyssa Thomas this past February scrambled the 33-year-old point guard’s plans. “I just want to be in an organization that truly invests from top to bottom: facilities, team, location, all of that. I want to compete for championships,” she said after the trade, which definitely stood in the way of all that. But then came a second trade, the biggest glamor upgrade she could hope for. Shuffled from a middle-of-the-pack Mercury team to a tanking Sun team to the defending champion Liberty, Cloud was so over and so back in the span of two months.</span>

                              <span>Knockout-tournament soccer is the best soccer because of how it amplifies the sport&#x27;s essence. The magic of the game lies in the tension between unpredictability and mastery. On one foot, the game is so difficult, so low-scoring, and played over such a relatively short timespan, that in 90 minutes truly anyone can beat anyone. On the other, the best players and teams are so good at dictating the encounter&#x27;s terms and appearing in the match&#x27;s few critical moments with touches of brilliance, that the outcome is rescued from a randomness that might render it meaningless and becomes imbued with real significance. The knockout tournament heightens both sides of this tension. Teams that reach the final do so by proving their ability to conquer entropy, but they only achieve glory by winning one last game, where anything can happen.
On Saturday, Arsenal pulled off a monumental upset by defeating Barcelona in the Women&#x27;s Champions League final. While this doesn&#x27;t make the Gunners necessarily the best team, it does I think make them the perfect winners of the club game&#x27;s best competition.</span>
