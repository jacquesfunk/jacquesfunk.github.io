                              <span>The mythos of Ferrari will sweep you up if you aren&#x27;t careful, and it&#x27;s easy to be careless in Monza. The tifosi are out in force. They carry massive flags emblazoned with the prancing horse, and bring flares that douse the stands in red. Oh, you&#x27;ll see similar scenes at the Dutch Grand Prix, and hear them at the British Grand Prix, but in Formula 1, only the tifosi are fully able to blur the line between nationalism and the rapturous worship of a team and its brand—or a brand and its team, depending on how you&#x27;d like to think about it. Meet a driver, and the first instinct is to clutch his hand and kiss it, like a king or a god. At the Italian Grand Prix, everyone is a Ferrari fan. Even if they say they&#x27;re not, they are Ferrari fans.
Charles Leclerc is the perfect vessel to carry all of it. Not quite homegrown, but tied to the team for any relevant span of his racing career. His debut year for Ferrari immediately cemented him as Ferrari&#x27;s answer to Max Verstappen; his bright, mercurial brilliance was enough to supersede even Sebastian &quot;Ferrari&#x27;s biggest fan&quot; Vettel, who had spent the two previous years fighting Lewis Hamilton honestly for a championship. Carlos Sainz Jr. is also racing for the team, but, biology aside, he doesn&#x27;t bleed red the way Leclerc does. It was Leclerc who, in 2019, gave Ferrari its first home win in nearly a decade. And with Lewis Hamilton joining the team next year, 2024 is perhaps the last year where he and his little wiener dog will form the undisputed core of the team.</span>

                              <span>Labor Day weekend means the official start of the college football season. The leaves are changing, the temperature is dropping, and we get our first sense of the contenders for one of the now 12 spots in the playoff. At the start of this season, some teams have shown surprising promise, like USC. Others have already made an emphatic statement, like Notre Dame and Miami. Some have started slow but are still in the fight, like defending champs Michigan. And then there&#x27;s FSU.
After unfairly (yes) getting left off of last year&#x27;s playoff, Florida State spent the offseason not just losing all their stars to graduation and the draft, but also doing a whole lot of bellyaching and threat-making, much to the consternation of everyone else. The school&#x27;s enemies and haters are surely delighting in seeing the Seminoles follow up all that bluster by blowing their first two games of the new season. Not only has FSU blown it, they&#x27;ve looked horrid all along the way. DJ Uiagalelei has somehow gotten worse after transferring over from Oregon State, the receivers are dropping passes, the defense is getting run all over by ACC &quot;powerhouses&quot; Georgia Tech and Boston College, and the play calling on both sides of the ball has been anemic.</span>

                              <span>Standing in the courtyard of a New York hotel, Sid Abbruzzi—the septuagenarian surf and skate legend from Newport, Rhode Island—held his phone to his ear while I asked him over a Zoom call what he thought about his anti-capitalist hero status. This July, directors the Kinnane Brothers released Water Brother, a feature documentary about Abbruzzi’s life.The film uses archival footage from 1969 to today to catalog Abbruzzi’s time as a rarified Newport local and owner of beloved surf shop, Water Brothers. The shop—a lighthouse to young skaters and surfers for the 50 years it was around—finally succumbed to destruction by developers in 2024, despite decades of pushback, hijinks, and punk vigor that had long kept the place alive. Water Brother, the documentary, tells it all.
“We were just free spirits,” Abbruzzi said of the 50 years that he ran the shop, at one point building an unsanctioned skate ramp in the parking lot and signing the local skater kids up for the Boy Scouts just to get insurance coverage. “All we wanted to do was skate and surf. In the film, [Johnny Leys says], ‘He was the worst businessman I’ve ever met.’ And that’s true.” During the storied history of Abbruzzi’s shop in Rhode Island, Abbruzzi earned the nickname the “Giveaway Butcher” because he was so motivated to get kids into surfing and skating that he was constantly giving gear away. And anyone who skates or surfs knows that the gear is not cheap. “I never got into this to be a businessman, to become a Ron Jon surf shop, to be any of that stuff,” Abbruzzi said. “And I&#x27;m glad I never did. Just to keep my head above water has been good enough for me.”</span>

                              <span>One thing you never want to hear when you&#x27;re an astronaut is, &quot;There are weird sounds coming from the spacecraft.&quot; Another thing you don&#x27;t want to hear, at least until it can prove otherwise, is &quot;It&#x27;s a Boeing Starliner.&quot; But since that&#x27;s already happened, and since NASA has decided it can&#x27;t or shouldn&#x27;t try to fix malfunctions in the Starliner&#x27;s thruster system, and will keep two astronauts on the International Space Station until next year rather than try to bring them back on this rickety tin can, everyone&#x27;s merely hoping the Starliner can get itself back to Earth later this week—uncrewed. In the meantime it&#x27;s just sitting there, docked to the ISS, possibly haunted.
This weekend, astronaut Butch Wilmore radioed Misson Control to let them know strange sounds were coming from Starliner&#x27;s speakers. He held his microphone up to the speakers to capture the sound, described as &quot;a pulsing noise, almost like a sonar ping.&quot; Again: Not great that it&#x27;s making mysterious noises, but since it is, might as well look on the bright side that it wasn&#x27;t chanting in backward Latin or somethng.</span>

                              <span>There is an auditory component to the James Wood Experience. For one thing, Washington&#x27;s 21-year-old phenom outfielder hits baseballs real hard. Every time a baseball is hit real hard, a loud noise is produced. I realize that the thing I am about to say is speculative, or even mystical, and possibly offensive to the very concept of science, but: There are certain baseball players who hit the ball louder even when they have not necessarily hit it faster or farther. Most of these players are themselves very large. Wood&#x27;s bat makes a distinct, crisp, ringing thwack sound even on grounders and foul balls and liners the other way. The thwack elongates and deepens into a thwock when he really connects, sonorous and even pulpy, an upsetting noise that registers in an atavistic part of the human brain as a signal of terrible violence. A home run off the bat of Wood (or Shohei Ohtani, or Aaron Judge, or Giancarlo Stanton) has this more primal resonance; the information it conveys in a split second causes a spontaneous, involuntary yelping reaction.

How&#x27;d you draft? Are you going receiver-receiver at the top, or are you pinning your hopes on a hero RB? Any rookies you think have a good chance to contribute right away? Did you bother stashing a second QB? Has your league gotten rid of kickers yet?
