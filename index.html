                              <span>Laura Mata López was born and raised in a low-income community in San José, Costa Rica. Some of her earliest memories were of the impact poverty and a lack of support for mental health had on her neighbors. Mata López&#x27;s mother and grandmother had migrated to Costa Rica from Colombia during the Colombian civil war, severing them from their roots and family. For a period of time, Mata López&#x27;s family was undocumented in Costa Rica, although their route to citizenship there was fairly easy. &quot;Even then, I always had this identity of being a migrant and being an other,&quot; Mata López said.
When Mata López was 12 years old, she immigrated to New York City, where her mother cleaned houses. When she started school, Mata López became selectively mute, a condition she could not name at the time. She was overcome with a knot in her throat when her mom dropped her off at school, only regaining the ability to speak when she returned home and spoke with her family in Spanish.</span>

                              <span>Pope Leo XIV celebrated his weekly general audience in St. Peter&#x27;s Square this morning, so you might assume he donned a White Sox ballcap at the request of one of his parishioners. I think it much more likely he just wears this around all the time, even to formal events where it&#x27;s entirely inappropriate. Have you met people from Chicago? He probably sold his mitre to buy a sandwich.
This fairly definitively puts to bed any lingering debate about which accursed Chicago franchise gets to claim the Pope, though the Cardinals and Padres could still make a case. In any event, the former Robert Prevost surely claims the White Sox—that is the face of a man who just heard that Jerry Reinsdorf might not sell the team until 2034.</span>

                              <span>On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton under the headline &quot;Tom Cotton: Send In The Troops, For Real.&quot; The piece was ostensibly written in response to the protests against the Trump administration&#x27;s anti-immigrant crackdowns currently taking place in Los Angeles, and it argues that the administration should use an &quot;overwhelming show of force&quot; to put an end to the protests.
It&#x27;s an odd piece of writing. For one thing, the troops have already been sent in—President Trump has sent National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles to guard federal buildings and ICE agents, against the wishes of California Governor Gavin Newsom. For another, the &quot;show of force&quot; has already happened—protestors have spent the last five days being beaten, arrested, tear-gassed, and shot with debilitating &quot;less lethal&quot; munitions. Taken on its own, it&#x27;s hard to imagine what the editors of the WSJ opinion page might have expected moderately informed readers to gain from Cotton&#x27;s piece, other than a vague sense of confusion and the less-vague sense that a United States Senator was upset.</span>

                              <span>I’ve made my fair share of terrible relationship decisions. There was the time my college sweetheart and I decided we would break up at the end of the semester, but stay together for the ensuing four months. There was the time I decided to date an ex of my nemesis. There was the time I decided it would be appropriate second-date behavior to light candles in every room my rental—in Tucson, in July, at 2:00 p.m. And then there was the time I agreed to an open relationship for the wrong reasons. 
This feels like something of a rite of passage for those of us on the dating scene in the last few decades. In this case, however, our friend-of-a-friend makes a similar decision under much stranger conditions: she’s the tag-along girlfriend of a guy doing a six-month apprenticeship at an internet-famous bee farm, which happens to be thrumming with socialism and polyamory. We’re thrilled to bring you this tale of sex and chaos as our season finale!</span>

                              <span>By at least one measure, the Boston Red Sox of 2025 are doing just fine. They&#x27;ve outscored their opponents on the season, modestly, but at a better clip than that of, say, the Philadelphia Phillies, who are presently nine games over .500 and slotted into the final National League wild card spot. Their lineup has been impressive, notwithstanding the lingering hurt feelings of a thoroughly jerked-around Rafael Devers: Boston ranks in the top six among all teams in batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging, yes with certain indications of batted-ball luck but nothing that would cause a Bostonian to assert any more than their usual dispensation of God&#x27;s particular favor. Devers has been excellent; Carlos Narváez, Jarren Duran, and Ceddanne Rafaela have been productive; Kristian Campbell, a rookie, has cooled off some but has still performed pretty admirably for one who appears to be a lanky child. Alex Bregman has been an absolute stud.
By other measures, the Sox are feeling some mid-summer pressure. They&#x27;re presently three games below .500, and are nine games back of the New York Yankees in their division, and are eighth in the wild card race, closer to the bottom than to the promised land. If the Baltimore Orioles were not cursed dog-doo, the Red Sox would almost certainly be last in the American League East, which incidentally is where they finished in consecutive seasons before seeming to take a step forward with 81 wins in 2024. This is not really a roster constructed to contend for a World Series, but the Red Sox have now hit a point in their rebuilding project where they will need to show some definite signs of seriousness in order to prove that they are not just settled into a condition of mediocrity, or worse. A fourth-place finish and 76-odd wins will be hard to explain as anything other than a stall.</span>

                              <span>Cal &quot;Big Dumper&quot; Raleigh is an outlier in the obvious sense—he is the current MLB home run leader—but pile on the descriptive adjectives, and you wind up with an amalgam of three truths, all theoretically past their prime: Cal Raleigh is a switch-hitting catcher who plays for the Mariners. Somehow, he is still the current MLB home run leader by a not-insignificant margin of two, his 26 homers beating out names like Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani. Per traditional standards, he is slashing a very respectable .264/.370/.632. Throw in some adjusted metrics, and he has a 182 wRC+, which is to say 82-percent better than the average MLB hitter, which is to say, the second-best player in baseball, beating out names like Freddie Freeman and Shohei Ohtani. Raleigh has, so far, cared not for the underpinnings of modern baseball. Where to even start? Perhaps in iambic tetrameter.

                              <span>It is the nature of a really good catch to make you feel like what you&#x27;ve just seen is the coolest thing ever to happen. That is how you know that what you&#x27;ve just seen is really good, and you can tell that you have seen something sufficiently cool if, for a moment, you find yourself reconsidering everything else you&#x27;ve seen. A great play should disorient you; a really great one will feel as if it was dropped on you from a great height.
There is a whole disordered way of being a sports fan that is built around following that natural instinct to reconsider everything all the way out, and into recursive madness; at every game you attend, there will be thousands of other people there whose relationship with sports amounts to constantly rearranging the faces on their own personal Mounts Rushmore and updating and itemizing a detailed personal taxonomy of Signature Moments. As a general rule, I think it is better not to be like that, and to just let the awe overtake you when and where it finds you. Not because it is smarter or more reasonable; no one cares about sports to become smarter or more reasonable. Just because it is more fun.</span>

                              <span>The fact that you are never quite as safe as you should be is one of the facts of contemporary American life, although the nature of that hazard varies from one American to the next. An unreasoning horror at and fear of the unknown is at the heart of the nation&#x27;s dominant political movement, and while much of that is bullshit—think of the seething, car-brained fear of The Cities And Their Crime that animates so much conservative media and agitates so many conservatives into full-spectrum derangement—there is also some truth to all that perceived hazard. That social anxiety generally tends to be directed towards big, cinematic threats, both because that sort of thing makes for better TV and because the actual forces that make American life precarious do that work much more quietly.
Few of those forces have done more damage, in relative secret, than the private equity firms that have spent the last few decades busily buying up and chewing through various American industries in relative secret are kind of abstract in comparison. What they have done, and what they do as a matter of course, is plenty brutal. It just isn&#x27;t quite violent enough to rate.</span>

                              <span>When Golden State Valkyries coach Natalie Nakase sat down with ESPN for an interview shortly after her team&#x27;s inaugural season began, the first question she fielded was an obvious one. What were her expectations? Her answer was honest, relatively optimistic, and riddled with coded ways to softly say the unavoidable: The Valks were probably going to lose a lot.
I was with her when she said, &quot;It&#x27;s going to take time,&quot; &quot;Let&#x27;s just get one percent better every single day,&quot; and &quot;I just want them to play with joy,&quot; because expansion teams never win. Not in basketball, anyway, where individual star talent tends to be the one thing that matters. The last two teams to join the WNBA, Atlanta and Chicago, won four and five games, respectively, in their inaugural efforts. These Valkyries were all but explicitly constructed as a team of seat-warmers, here to give the front office an up-close look before this offseason&#x27;s forthcoming free-agent apocalypse. They selected Lithuanian wing Juste Jocyte with their first-ever draft pick, yet she won&#x27;t even play until next season. The roster is young, undersized, and extremely European (&quot;I have to learn French is what I’ve learned,&quot; Nakase recently quipped to the Athletic.)</span>

                              <span>When the Panthers acquired Brad Marchand at the trade deadline, it kind of felt like putting a hat on a hat. Or a rat on a rat. This was a team already known and feared and hated for the way they relentlessly antagonized their opponents, and the division-leading defending champs had returned their top eight players by points from the previous campaign. It was unclear if Marchand, who&#x27;d just suffered an injury, would make all that much of a difference in his first stop outside of Boston. But even if he didn&#x27;t, Florida could taunt the rest of the league with just his presence. Oh, you called us dirty before? What will you think when we join up with the Mad Licker Of The West End?
As a regular-season Panther, Marchand did indeed contribute little of note, getting two meaningless goals in the last three games before the playoffs. But in the postseason, the 37-year-old has proven a nuisance, a playmaker, and a devastating scorer. Across what might turn out to be the most important stretch of the Stanley Cup Final, from the end of Game 2 to the start of Game 3, Marchand seized the spotlight.</span>

A younger version of Maron would have given an &quot;Oh, come on!&quot; to my caffeine source, a matcha latte, as opposed to Maron&#x27;s preference, the strongest coffee possible. But longtime listeners know Maron also went through a tea phase (episode 949), so I like to think that the current version of Maron would let it slide.
I first listened to WTF with Marc Maron in October of 2010 (episode 117) because I heard This American Life host Ira Glass say that he had appeared on it. I was immediately hooked. I had simply never heard an interview like that one, with a host so engaged and a guest so honestly and openly themself. I binged as many as I could the following weekend while cleaning my apartment and told my long-distance boyfriend he had to start listening, too.</span>

                              <span>&quot;Well, definitely, the third period is an unraveling,&quot; Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch said, and he was underselling it in a nice little piece of dry coachspeak. Edmonton seized the opportunity of getting blown out to take out all their collected frustrations toward the Panthers, and they had plenty of those. That&#x27;s sort of what the Panthers do. They make you very, very mad, and then you blow up, and then they mock you, because they&#x27;re winning 6-1 and have a 2-1 lead in the Stanley Cup Final. Because Florida&#x27;s means, mean as they are, have an end beyond agitation for its own sake. They want you to play their game. And they&#x27;re better at it than you are.
This was the quintessential Florida Panthers playoff game. A true ass-kicking from 56 seconds on, when Brad Marchand punched home a loose puck after an offensive-zone faceoff. Panthers physicality led directly to Panthers goals, with no better illustration than Sam Bennett basically body-checking himself to a breakaway the other way, and the fourth Florida goal that gave this one official rout status.</span>

                              <span>Cork upset dynastic host Limerick at a sold-out Gaelic Grounds on Saturday on penalty shots to take the 2025 Munster hurling championship in the first final decided on penalty shots in the 147-year history of the annual provincial competition. With the win, Cork booked a spot in the semifinals of this year’s All-Ireland tournament. 
The match, a non-stop affair full of lead changes and roughhousing, was the latest in a string of instant classic playoff tilts the ancient Gaelic game has delivered fans in the last few years. After regulation and two overtimes, the score stood at Limerick 2-27, Cork 1-30, or 33 points apiece.</span>

                              <span>One of the fun, mildly disorienting experiences inherent to watching the Oklahoma City Thunder is having to remember just how many guys they have. Were you aware that they traded five second-round picks last summer for a rookie from Weber State named Dillon Jones, and that Jones played 10 minutes a game this year? One would assume that the quality and level of OKC&#x27;s depth would matter less as the playoffs progressed. While that is true in the sense that Jones and his cohort of deep bench-mates have been marginalized in the postseason, OKC is still dominating with their depth. Consider: Aaron Wiggins.
The fourth-year guard was critical for the Thunder off the bench in Game 2 of the Finals, logging 18 points in 21 minutes and finishing a team-high plus-24. Somewhat strangely for a bench player, the stuff Wiggins is good at is best-player stuff. His best and most important skill is three-point shooting, though he&#x27;s far more than a shooter. He is 6-foot-6 with a plus wingspan; he&#x27;s extremely athletic, if a little bit slight. Wiggins can drive, handle the rock in traffic, read scrambling defenses, and kick the ball out to open shooters. He has moves, and he uses them at the rim to make all sorts of impressive and impressively tough shots. Wiggins is a decent rebounder, never turns the ball over, and an active, pesky on-ball defender. The most important thing about Wiggins is that he doesn&#x27;t have a weakness, not one that is all that damaging anyway. He dropped 41 and 14 on the Kings this year!</span>

                              <span>Mia Scott is a menace to every team unlucky enough to face her. At third base, she&#x27;s an immovable object and a nightmare for all right-handed batters. In the batter&#x27;s box, she demonizes opposing pitching. Over the three games of the NCAA Softball World Series last week, Scott hit a whopping .529 with two home runs.
In the third game of the WCWS, Scott came up to bat with the bases loaded and no outs, her Texas Longhorns already up 6-0. The Texas Tech pitcher whipped the ball toward her without enough rise or movement. It just sat there above the plate, and Scott&#x27;s hands flew at it so fast you could barely see the bat make contact in real time. She dropped the bat behind her and trotted to first base, because that gorgeous highlighter-yellow ball was soaring way out to center field, past the 220 sign, and into the stands: a grand slam, in what might have been the very last game of her career.</span>

                              <span>The Nations League is, at its core, a money grab. Replacing international friendlies with an ostensibly meaningful tournament is a sensible idea on paper, but UEFA&#x27;s (and later CONCACAF&#x27;s) main motivation for it was to wring more money out of the previously low-stakes, low-interest midseason international breaks. When taken in that context, it&#x27;s easy to dismiss the tournament as yet another monument to soccer&#x27;s ruling powers&#x27; insatiable greed.
Since the competition itself has no historical relevance and little actual prestige, the attempts to juice these matches with Significance scan as pretty silly. An example: The Nations League semifinal between France and Spain was billed as a head-to-head showdown between Ousmane Dembélé and Lamine Yamal, two of last season&#x27;s most outstanding players, for no less than the Ballon d&#x27;Or itself. This is the type of pre-match hype that the Nations League, by its very existence, demands. It&#x27;s not important enough on its own, so there must be a manufactured narrative to make it matter.</span>

                              <span>Joy Binion learned that she had lost her job as a social science analyst at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, on April 1. So she posted on Facebook that she had been affected by a reduction in force, or RIF. A month later in a conversation with a friend, Binion mentioned the fact that she had lost her job. He reacted in total shock. &quot;I thought that was an April Fool&#x27;s joke,&quot; Binion&#x27;s friend said of her Facebook post.
SAMHSA (pronounced sam-sah), which is housed under the Department of Health and Human Services, might not be a familiar acronym to most people. The agency supports Americans who suffer from mental health conditions and who experience addiction. SAMHSA operates the 988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline, which has received more than 14.5 million calls, texts, and messages since it launched in July 2022. The agency also assists communities with grants for treatment and recovery centers, especially in rural areas where long distances from treatment centers act as a barrier to recovery.</span>

                              <span>Megan Courtney-Lush was ready to retire. She played four years of college volleyball at Penn State and then went on to play professionally in Puerto Rico, Poland, Turkey, and Italy. After 10 years, she had decided that it was time to come home and move on to the next stage of her life. She bought a house in Columbus, Ohio and was several months pregnant in 2023 when she got an unexpected phone call. Someone was starting a professional women&#x27;s volleyball league in the U.S., and they wanted her to play. &quot;I said &#x27;No thanks, I&#x27;m out,&#x27;&quot; she told me, laughing.
But the calls kept coming. Columbus would have a team, they told her, coached by Ángel Pérez, former captain of the Puerto Rican men&#x27;s national team. Pérez called Courtney-Lush himself, trying to see if he could get her on the court, and she kept looking for excuses to stay home: &quot;I played hardball. I kept coming up with all these random things I would need and they kept saying yes.&quot; Four months after having her first child, Courtney-Lush found herself back on the volleyball court, playing in the first active professional women&#x27;s volleyball league in the United States since 1989.</span>

The Oilers star was at practice yesterday, two days after his absurd first-period carve-up was relegated from pivotal play to mere highlight-reel staple by the Panthers&#x27; eventual double-overtime victory. The unwritten rules of postgame press conferences dictate that questions won&#x27;t dwell on a play that ended up not affecting the game&#x27;s outcome, especially for the losing team, and McDavid wouldn&#x27;t have wanted to talk about it on Friday anyway—the usual blank-faced captain&#x27;s deflections would&#x27;n&#x27;t have made good copy. But I was hopeful, at Sunday&#x27;s skate and media availability, that McDavid might&#x27;ve moved on from the loss and been willing to walk us through exactly what was in his mind when he did this:</span>

                              <span>Welcome to Margin of Error, a politics column from Tom Scocca, editor of the Indignity newsletter.
As a voter in the New York City mayoral race, I keep thinking about the rats and the garbage cans. The story of the election, as generally framed, is that Andrew Cuomo has come down to New York from the suburbs and back from political exile to offer his own hard-nosed, practical experience as an alternative to a field of candidates who are some combination of too idealistic, too leftist, or too unseasoned to handle the serious business of running a great and difficult metropolis. The city, he declared in Wednesday&#x27;s mayoral debate, is in a &quot;management crisis&quot;—as well as a &quot;fiscal crisis&quot; and a &quot;societal crisis&quot;—and he is the one person who is prepared and willing to take on &quot;dysfunctional city management.&quot;</span>

There was an insanely cool sequence in the first half where he seemed to take a horse-hair bow and go fiddle mode on the superstrings of reality. It started with a glaring mismatch. The Thunder were up a point inside the final minute of the first quarter, and the floor was out of shape, with Andrew Nembhard switched onto Isaiah Hartenstein, Aaron Nesmith sagging off of Alex Caruso in the corner, and Gilgeous-Alexander guarded up near the arc by Thomas Bryant, a backup center. An appalling 16 seconds were left on the shot clock, an eternity for a bumbling big guy like Bryant to spend isolated against the game&#x27;s very best shot creator…</span>

                              <span>Veteran left-hander Rich Hill signed a minor league deal last month. It appears the club will soon have to make a decision on whether or not to call him up. Robert Murray of FanSided reports that there’s a June 15th opt-out in that deal. Since signing that pact, Hill has made four minor league starts,…</span>

                              <span>A match that perfect deserves no restraint, so: Carlos Alcaraz&#x27;s 4–6, 6–7 (4), 6–4, 7–6 (3), 7–6 (10–2) French Open final victory over Jannik Sinner is the best tennis match I&#x27;ve ever watched, and one of the greatest sporting events you or I will probably ever have the privilege of witnessing. You do not have to know or care about tennis or either of these players or even sports to find something to love about this match. All you need is a body, to appreciate the limits each player overcame out there on the red clay, and a spirit, to appreciate how deep they each had to dig to reach a place no pair has ever gone at Roland Garros.
The five-hour, 29-minute marathon saw the duo break all manner of records. Alcaraz saved three match points, the first time anyone&#x27;s ever done so en route to the title. The final was nearly 45 minutes longer than the previous longest French Open final and 24 minutes short of the 2012 Australian Open decider for the longest major final in the open era. Alcaraz had never come back from two sets down, and Sinner had never lost a major final. Neither player had, for that matter. The 12th meeting between Sinner and Alcaraz was comfortably the best, clearing the lofty bar they set three years ago at the U.S. Open.</span>

                              <span>Oklahoma City led for all but scant moments of Game 1 of the NBA Finals. For around 39 seconds of the first quarter, the score sat at 10–10, between an Andrew Nembhard three-pointer that tied it for Indiana and a floater from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander that untied it and put the Thunder ahead. Oklahoma City kept that lead until Tyrese Haliburton&#x27;s game-winning jumper with 0.3 seconds left to play. For much of that time, the Thunder led by double digits, or at least by a handful of possessions&#x27; worth of baskets.
Likewise, for much of that time, particularly in the first half, Oklahoma City&#x27;s half-court offense just kind of didn&#x27;t matter: Between the advantages the Thunder got by running off of Indiana&#x27;s copious turnovers and misses, and Gilgeous-Alexander&#x27;s ability to create points and free-throw attempts off the dribble, they didn&#x27;t really need to calm down and manufacture a series of baskets. Then they did need to do that, and couldn&#x27;t. As Indiana scrambled to wipe away a nine-point deficit over the game&#x27;s final three minutes or so, the Thunder, perhaps just tuned this way by a season of playing at a full sprint, repeatedly let themselves get baited into early shots.</span>

                              <span>The aspect from Coco Gauff&#x27;s altogether impressive French Open final win that I find myself most impressed by is, oddly, something that didn&#x27;t go her way. Gauff is now a two-time Grand Slam champion, and though are several parallels between her two upsets of Aryna Sabalenka, her most recent triumph was the more thorough of the two. Consider how things started for her on Saturday.
Gauff lost a heartbreaker of a first set to Sabalenka at Roland Garros, a 6–7 (5) odyssey that lasted longer than an hour and cost her a tremendous amount of effort to get back into, go ahead in, and eventually lose. Sabalenka raced out to a 4–1, 40–love lead in the set in the first 20 minutes, and the final seemed like it might go the way Gauff&#x27;s first French Open final did, when she barely bothered to give Iga Swiatek anything to do in 2022. But Sabalenka faltered and allowed Gauff to break her serve and then hold, kicking off a gnarly run of five straight breaks that led into a tiebreak. Gauff finally got ahold of her serve and seized a 4–1 in that tiebreak before Sabalenka ripped it away from her.</span>

                              <span>For four years now I have been informing every Dillon (or Dylan) I meet of the existence of a Tigers catching prospect called Dillon Dingler. If you know too much about baseball, you have to talk to the well-adjusted about it at least occasionally. Even if you have perfect self control, and never annoy people with the stupid shit they don&#x27;t care about (couldn&#x27;t be me), people still sometimes just want to know what it is you&#x27;re spending all that time learning about, and you have to have something ready for them. Fun facts are good, but there are only so many that are actually understandable by agnostics. Dillon Dingler, on the other hand, is worth knowing about on every level.
Dingler is a 26-year-old playing his first full season for a shockingly good Tigers squad that&#x27;s winning more than anyone else in the Majors. To begin, his name is very funny. And, by the way, Dillon is his middle name! He chose to aliterate with the last name Dingler! But he has a signature quirk beyond his literal signature: He is allergic to taking a walk. In 27 games last year, his incessant swinging was a liability at the plate for the Tigers. But 2025, though it&#x27;s still early, is looking like a breakout for Dingler. Scouts have always loved his defense, and now he&#x27;s rocking a nice 126 WRC+ to go with that glove.</span>

                              <span>Other than every interaction either of them has had with another living being in their entire lives, as well as every single thing that is true about either of their personalities, and everything that either of them believes about themselves and each other and all others and life and the world, and their being the absolute two worst people presently alive, there was no reason to think, or even to fear, that Donald Trump and Elon Musk would not remain loyal allies and strategic partners forever. Alas, the dream of lifelong friendship died on Thursday, in a cascade of insults and threats posted to their respective embarrassing social media platforms. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;ll never trust again.
Things had been getting testier between the two for some time, as the Trump administration pursues certain policies—the ridiculous tariffs, for one thing, and &quot;I am not going to dignify this shit by digging too deep into what else it might be&quot; for another—at odds with Musk&#x27;s business interests. Musk&#x27;s reckless DOGE hacking spree both failed on its own terms and also left the administration at risk of actually delivering the crippled administrative state its supporters pretend to want or think they want but definitely do not want. Musk is known to be an opponent of Trump&#x27;s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (sigh); he thinks it doesn&#x27;t do enough to shred the federal government, or anyway that&#x27;s been his public-facing complaint about it. More credibly he is upset that the bill eliminates certain tax deductions and credits associated with electric vehicle (EV) purchases. Anything that is bad for Tesla, his car company, is bad for Musk personally, as a huge portion of his wealth is tied up in company stock, and he used that stock as collateral when he borrowed tens of billions of dollars for his foolish purchase of Twitter in 2022.</span>

                              <span>The queen is dead. It took three straight titles and 26 consecutive match wins at Roland-Garros for Iga Swiatek to finally lose on the Parisian clay. Aryna Sabalenka deservedly got the scalp, outlasting Swiatek in a Thursday semifinal played at a level so blisteringly high it obliterated any thought that the other semi would take place right afterwards. (Apologies to Coco Gauff, who could absolutely beat Sabalenka in the final, and home hero Lois Boisson.) Swiatek might have surrendered her crown, but not without playing some of the best tennis of the year so far. Rarely should a defeat, especially one by the close-not-close scoreline of 7-6 (1), 4-6, 6-0, inspire this much praise for the loser. 
Part of that is because Swiatek has now gone a full year without winning a title. This isn’t as apocalyptic as it sounds for a player who has won five majors. A single point separated her from the Australian Open final, and how bad can a slump be when you remain in the Top 10? But some of her losses were worrying, as was her demeanor on court. Watch the wrong players and you might not get a full appreciation for how stressful this sport is, in which grueling tournaments yield only one winner and scores of losers every week.</span>

                              <span>Whenever Yara Haridy, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago, shows off the fossils she works with, people are often disappointed. Unlike the statuesque bones of dinosaurs or even the small spirals of ancient seashells, Haridy&#x27;s fossils &quot;kind of look like dust, or like the last little bit in your cereal,&quot; she said, adding that scientists call them &quot;fish flakes.&quot; These fossils are too tiny to spot, let alone excavate on site. Instead, geologists take layers of rock and dissolve them in acid, revealing the bones and other organic bits left behind. This is how researchers first discovered the fish flakes, after the mote-like fossils suddenly appeared at a certain point in Cambrian rocks.
Earth&#x27;s earliest vertebrates are little more than squishy, wormy critters with no hard parts of their own. But after about a 20-million-year gap, suddenly the record shows vertebrates &quot;that look like small little armored tanks or Roombas that are swimming around,&quot; said Karma Nanglu, a paleobiologist at Harvard University&#x27;s Museum of Comparative Zoology. Haridy hoped that the fish flakes might help fill in the gap: a hypothetical vertebrate somewhere between &quot;the squishy guys and the fully formed fish.&quot;</span>

Pete DeBoer has made six out of the last seven conference finals, with three different teams—and been fired by them all, after the Stars announced today that they think they can do better. Perhaps even more impressive than DeBoer&#x27;s run is that his firing isn&#x27;t a surprise in the least.
“After careful consideration, we believe that a new voice is needed in our locker room to push us closer to our goal of winning the Stanley Cup,” Dallas GM Jim Nill said in a statement, a week after the Stars bowed out in a perfunctory five games to the Oilers. It&#x27;s the rare team statement that says exactly what it means: DeBoer lost the room. Even a well-respected coach&#x27;s voice stops having an effect when Sisyphus&#x27;s boulder rolls back down the hill for the third season in a row.</span>

                              <span>After months of rather awkward courtship, the Pittsburgh Steelers and free agent quarterback Aaron Rodgers agreed last night to spend 18 weeks together in darkness. Sources tell Defector that the darkness will be “vast” and “impenetrable,” casting “a permanent shadow over Western Pennsylvania” that will “extinguish all traces, all memory, of the lighted world.”
This darkness—this total fucking darkness—is scheduled to envelop the Steelers on September 7 of this year and remain in place for 18 weeks thereafter. Earlier this spring, other NFL teams expressed mild interest in having the darkness consume them entirely. But the Steelers, famous for using the color black on their home jerseys, were always a natural match for Rodgers, and for the parasitic void that both parties are now doomed to inhabit.</span>

                              <span>Here are some relevant statistics from Game 1 of the NBA Finals: The Oklahoma City Thunder had 18 fewer turnovers than the Indiana Pacers; the Thunder attempted 16 more field goals than the Pacers and took exactly half of their shots at the rim; 14 of the Pacers&#x27; 24 turnovers were caused by Thunder steals; the Pacers led the game for 0.3 seconds. Here is the most relevant of them all: This morning the Thunder find themselves down 0-1 in the NBA Finals, having fallen to the Pacers, 111–110.
For about 47 minutes, this game looked like nothing other than a win for the Thunder. All those pre-series questions about whether the Pacers&#x27; chaos-forward offense could somehow undermine the Thunder&#x27;s brutal attacking defense started to feel very silly, very quickly. The Thunder held the Pacers to 20 points in the first quarter and ripped away 12 steals in the first half, setting a record for most steals in a half during the play-by-play era. OKC&#x27;s defense was doing exactly what it did to the Timberwolves and Nuggets, and it was doing to Tyrese Haliburton exactly what it did to Nikola Jokic and Anthony Edwards—shoving him into the margins of the game as a bully shoves a victim into a locker. Haliburton finished the first half with three turnovers and six points on four field goal attempts.</span>

This is natural enough, given how unnatural it is to be on a podcast in the first place, and the specific unnatural/unholy attributes of ours. But Will Leitch is not one of those guests. He has known Drew forever, and worked with him for only slightly less time than that, and that surely helped. I myself have only met the man a few times, although I have read his writing for many years, but again—that does not matter. Will Leitch comes on a podcast ready to be the guest on that podcast, and buddy was he ever the guest this week.</span>

                              <span>VARIOUS CITIES (SOME ARGUABLY TOWNS), France — The first time I visited France, I was on the subway when a woman and a group of elementary school–aged girls rushed into the car. It was midday; I was confused, but assumed nothing. Everyone in the seats stood, which is the usual habit for making space in a train car; the chairs by the door fold up, making room on busier trains.
An East Asian woman who was sitting in one of those chairs, whom I noticed because she spent much of the ride engaging in French-style PDA with her partner, leaned back over to me and said, in Mandarin, &quot;Tell your friends to be careful.&quot; By friends, she meant my sisters, who were a bit squished to the back of the train car but otherwise untouched. Be careful about what? I told her that I thought they were doing fine, and then she elaborated: &quot;They are trying to trick them.&quot;</span>

                              <span>In a third-grade classroom exercise, Patrick Kelly wrote that he wanted to become a scientist when he grew up. With that interest came an attention to the people that science can help. &quot;I&#x27;ve just always been super-curious about human nature, our interactions with one another,&quot; he said.
In college, Kelly pivoted to public health, which is no doubt a science deeply interested in the interactions people have with one another. After working in a series of labs in Philadelphia, Kelly joined the Brown University School of Public Health as a doctoral student, where he researches how social and structural influences, like laws, affect people&#x27;s medical decision-making, with a focus on people who use drugs, LGBTQ communities, and the intersection between the two. &quot;So all things from stigma to sociopolitical climate,&quot; he explained. &quot;How people navigate the healthcare environment and how we&#x27;re able to provide healthcare resources to people.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Twenty-eight NBA teams lay crumpled and destroyed at the foot of the mountain, defeated for all time, never to rise again from their shame. The Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers snarl at each other across the bald summit, beneath the darkening sky. One shall feast upon the other! The NBA Finals are here, and absolutely none of this is metaphorical.
For the Thunder, this is their first appearance in the Finals since 2012, when the hotshot young core of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden fell in five games to the hotter-shot medium core of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh. At the time that series, though crappy and disappointing as an actual basketball contest, seemed like it was going to be the beginning of a long rivalry between two great teams, but, well ... for the favored Thunder, this is their first appearance in the Finals since 2012. The franchise kept that core going for a while before briefly dipping into the toilet, which allowed them to accumulate the hotshot young core—MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jalen Williams, Chet Holmgren—that carried the team to a league-best 68 regular-season wins this season, and which has stormed all but unimpeded through the West playoffs. They&#x27;re the huge favorites in this series. Probably in betting terms or whatever, but more importantly in our estimation of how this thing is likely to go.</span>

                              <span>As the barrier between NBA players and NBA media dissolves, so too does the illusion that any amount of fame and success can prevent athletes from giving into the media&#x27;s lamest impulses. It should not be the case that LeBron James and Steve Nash, two universally respected and accomplished world-class athletes with more money than they could ever possibly spend, care about how many people are listening to and enjoying their podcast. That is something that podcasters should worry about, not athletes. And yet here we are, in a media environment in which even these two greats cannot prevent themselves from thinking and acting like podcasters.

In any situation where you&#x27;re doubling up a team in that category while still losing, it&#x27;s natural to look to the goalie for blame. And Oiler netminder Stuart Skinner is a ready-made scapegoat.
A career subpar goalie in the playoffs coming off a career-worst third full season in the NHL, the 26-year-old Skinner symbolizes the Oilers&#x27; struggle to find a permanent stopper in net worthy of the skaters in front of him. Kings fans relished picking on Skinner early in the first round, and he lost his starting job when his team lost the opening two games. Since he regained his place due to injury, Skinner&#x27;s been something miraculous, putting up a 7-2 record with the victory on Wednesday. Still, given the way Bobrovsky played in Florida&#x27;s four wins during the Cup Final last year, and the fairly consistent performances the Panther vet had delivered in these playoffs so far, it was reasonable to single out Skinner as the shaky foundation. Guys like McDavid and Draisaitl have earned the highest level of trust; Stuart Skinner has not.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s not about throwing a punch. We know both these teams can land a haymaker. No team gets this far without that skill, even if each comes at it from a slightly different angle—the Oilers, more straightforward, windmilling their arms as they close the gap on you, daring you to stop it even when you know it&#x27;s coming; the Panthers, maybe taking you off-guard with a knee to the groin or some pocket sand in the eyes before striking.
Instead, the Stanley Cup Final is about taking a punch. Can you suffer blows to the body and psyche, and keep playing your brand of hockey? Can you take the fight to an opponent who smells your blood, and likes the smell? These Oilers and Panthers would seem uniquely suited to counterpunching. Edmonton, who set an NHL playoff record last month with six straight comeback wins. Florida, who went down two games to Toronto, then flipped a switch and haven&#x27;t looked back since. But could the Oilers take the Panthers&#x27; best thump?</span>

                              <span>Without Paige Bueckers, the Dallas Wings look like what they were last year, when they were also without Paige Bueckers, which was a very bad basketball team. So bad, in fact, that they landed in the lottery and got to draft Paige Bueckers. The first-overall pick has missed her team’s last two games under concussion protocol; she banged heads with Courtney Vandersloot in a Wings-Sky game last week and complained of a headache the next day. The team says she will be re-evaluated this week.
The step after drafting a franchise player is to figure out who else should stick around, and that must be done in Bueckers’s absence. It is unpleasant work. On Tuesday against the Storm in Seattle, the Wings revealed the answer to be “basically no one.” They fell to a league-worst 1-7 on the season in a game they led by 11 in the third quarter. On the strength of their gang rebounding in the first half, the Wings put up some 20 more shots than the Storm, though this did much more for the denominator than for the numerator in the end. Final line: 30-for-86.</span>

A thing immediately noticeable, if one were to observe and track these exchanges over a length of time, is that the viral animal trafficking is much heavier on slow news days, because we are bored.

                              <span>For the second straight year, the Florida Panthers are playing the Edmonton Oilers for the Stanley Cup. I&#x27;m not convinced that we can see their futures by looking at their pasts, but I think it&#x27;s worthwhile to refresh ourselves on how we got here, and why this will be the rare Cup matchup that comes with a history.
Who are these guys?</span>

                              <span>You, the savvy baseball fan, are almost certainly wise to imagine what Pittsburgh Pirates ace Paul Skenes will look like someday wearing some other team&#x27;s uniform. If you are a fan of one of six particular franchises, you might even sensibly dare to imagine what Skenes might look like wearing your team&#x27;s uniform. The odds are heavily against Skenes playing the back half of his career in Pittsburgh.
For one thing, top-end starters tend to change teams, and tend especially to flow away from broke-dick bozo outfits like the one in Pittsburgh and in the direction of, you know, serious professional organizations. For another, the Pirates in particular don&#x27;t generally hold onto their real-deal pitchers. The last pitcher to make it to 150 starts with Pittsburgh was Paul Maholm, a guy I almost remember, and who last toed the rubber for the Pirates in 2011. Maholm is one of only two pitchers to cross that threshold for the franchise since 1993. By way of comparison, the Colorado Rockies, whose pitchers are sandbagged by the worst possible environmental conditions, have had seven 150-start fellas over that span. I am not here to say that the Rockies are doing anything right, because they super-duper are not—for all I know the team is in its present horrific state as divine punishment for the crime of having given 206 starts to Aaron Cook—only to point out that the last starter to go eight seasons in Pittsburgh was born before the invention of the compact disc. Relatedly, Mitch Keller, currently in his seventh season in Pittsburgh and climbing toward 150 career starts, has a couple seasons left on an extension signed in 2024, and is about to be traded as hell.</span>

                              <span>It probably does not matter who occupies the position of hitting coach for the Colorado Rockies. For the previous three seasons, the job belonged to Hensley Meulens, and his only notable contribution to the franchise&#x27;s history was illegally clambering into the cockpit of a 757 while it was in flight. Meulens was fired in April, when the Rockies&#x27; offense was the worst in the league, and replaced by former Rockies head coach Clint Hurdle. A few weeks later, he was bumped up to bench coach and two more guys, Jordan Pacheco and Nic Wilson, were named co-hitting coaches. The Rockies&#x27; offense is still the worst in the league.
That shouldn&#x27;t really bother anyone. I mean, yes, it is a symptom of the larger disease plaguing the Rockies that they didn&#x27;t fire Meulens in the offseason and give themselves time to bring in a new hitting coach with fresh ideas, but instead panic-fired him in April and then handed the job to a well-past-it former manager who has been enjoying various make-work jobs in the organization since 2019, and then split the job among two new bozos. But like I said, the roster is garbage and no amount of emphasis on the players&#x27; two-strike approach is going to make much of a difference.</span>

                              <span>Viewed from one angle, Tom Thibodeau losing his job as head coach of the New York Knicks, a development reported this afternoon by Shams Charania, appears deeply unfair. Here&#x27;s a guy who led his team to a 51-win regular season, a trip to the Eastern Conference final—kicking the beans out of the hated Boston Celtics along the way—and got two wins away from the NBA Finals, and is now jobless. If you were fired under similar conditions, you would probably feel pretty hard done by.
But the true states of a basketball team and its head coach&#x27;s suitability for employment are never quite as simple as the macro conditions might make them seem. Before the playoffs began, the Knicks were marked as a particularly underwhelming three-seed. Their net rating was plus-4.3, they had very few impressive wins against good teams, and Thibodeau was once again burying his starters under a mountain of needless minutes. Whatever shine the playoff results themselves had restored could be easily tarnished by some of the underlying facts: The Knicks went 10-8 in the playoffs with a point differential of exactly 0, and the starting five that Thibs leaned on so heavily in the regular season was so bad—minus-31 in 335 minutes—that Mitchell Robinson was inserted into the starting lineup partway through the conference final.</span>

It&#x27;s the first day of Bitcoin 2025, industry day here at the largest cryptocurrency conference in the world. This Winklevoss is sharing the stage with the other one, plus Donald Trump&#x27;s newly appointed crypto and AI czar David Sacks. They are in the midst of a victory lap, laughing with the free ease of men who know they have it made. The mangled baseball metaphor neither lands nor elicits laughs, but that&#x27;s fine.

                              <span>It’s 1994. Nike, whose golden goose has put down the basketball and picked up the baseball bat, is trying to figure out what to do with one of the brightest young talents in the NBA. His name is Penny Hardaway. His game is silky smooth, his shot is effortless, and he glides through defenses like Houdini. He’s a good-looking kid, tall but not gangly, with a cool haircut and a great smile. He plays alongside of one of the league’s newest larger-than-life characters, Shaquille O’Neal. By most metrics, he looks to be the perfect spokesman, but there’s one major problem: he’s very shy. Not flashy, not over-the-top. A showman on the court but nowhere else. Nike, though, has an idea: instead of forcing him to be more outspoken, what if he had a personal spokesman of sorts? Another version of himself that could embody the personality and flair his game has but the man lacks?
&quot;They said, &#x27;since you’re so quiet and reserved and laid-back, wouldn’t it be great to give you an alter ego?&#x27;&quot; Hardaway recalled about his conversations with Nike over the direction of their marketing campaign. &quot;We called the alter ego Lil Penny and I loved it right away, because somebody would be talking trash for me. I thought that was pretty cool.&quot;</span>

                              <span>PHILADELPHIA — The Benham Brothers think they are very funny and very smart. They are 50-year-old tall, blonde, identical twins who have a series of scripted jokes that mostly amount to calling each other stupid and effeminate. They are not pastors, which is maybe why they are so bad at reading the Bible. I know because I watched them try this weekend.
The Benham Brothers were the second speakers to go on stage this weekend at a Christian wealth conference called Life Surge. The event was held at the Wells Fargo Center from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m., and it featured speakers like former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean, Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni, and Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley. I went because I wanted to know what exactly a bunch of Eagles were endorsing with their presence.</span>

                              <span>Last summer I attended Rare Book School at Princeton, which is about the tweediest thing a person can do. One humid day, after a morning spent squinting at Gutenberg Bibles, I sipped a coffee with Amy Dawson, a lifelong librarian and cataloguer with decades of experience in rare books. Dawson has a careful, thoughtful demeanor, shoulder-length blonde curly hair, and a quick laugh. She also moonlights as a library consultant for the Rowfant Club, a rare books club for men in Cleveland, founded in 1892. Women may visit the club as guests, work in its library, or attend its lectures on Wednesday evenings and Friday lunchtime—but cannot become members. I was immediately intrigued. 
I have an attraction-repulsion thing for men’s-only institutions. I attended Bowdoin College, a school that didn’t go fully co-ed until 1971. Now I collect books about my alma mater written before 1950, when I would not have been allowed to attend. In my early 20s, I briefly worked as a personal assistant for a nonagenarian retired banker on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was lovely, tipped generously, and liked his sheets ironed every day. When I wasn’t ordering him corduroy pants, I would make his dinner reservations at the Union Club, where only men can become members. The policy annoyed him, because he was looking for a girlfriend.</span>

I certainly could have slept last night—my excitement for the dream of interning here was outweighed by Amtrak-induced exhaustion. But unfortunately for me, Oregon State was doing something to USC on a baseball field. It wasn&#x27;t exactly baseball, not as you and I know it. What it was ... well ... maybe you can tell me.
It would have been OSU&#x27;s two consecutive squeeze plays, which made three consecutive bunts of what would be four bunts in the second inning—that was when I knew that I would have no escape to unconsciousness.</span>

                              <span>Spend enough time watching the best chess players in the world play, and even a chess amateur will pick up on something: Space is at such a premium in their games that any seemingly innocent, sensible move—sliding the A-pawn to the third rank to prevent the dark-square bishop from forcing check, burning a tempo to line your rook up with the opposing queen even though four pieces separate them—can be punished several moves down the line. The greats can project themselves forward in time and see weaknesses before they even begin to develop.
That is not what happened on Sunday when Magnus Carlsen lost to current world champion Gukesh Dommaraju. The former world champion played very relatable chess, by which I mean he committed an unspeakable blunder to lose from a winning position and then pounded the table in disgust.</span>

The main character of our tale is Iowa (uh oh) Senator Joni Ernst, who held a town hall in her home state this past Friday. Ernst’s constituents at that town hall were vocally angry about President Trump’s massive tax bill, which passed in the House a month ago and threatens to cut half a trillion dollars in funding to Medicaid. People will die if this bill passes in Ernst’s chamber. When one audience member informed the Senator of this fact, she responded, with supreme Midwestern condescension, “Well, we’re all going to die.”
That’s the first part of our story. The second part is Ernst’s formal response to the heckling, which she recorded on her phone while walking around a graveyard. Take it away, womanboss.</span>

                              <span>The Kansas City Royals advised minor-leaguer Jac Caglianone, their first pick in the 2024 draft and top overall prospect, that he could accelerate his path to the majors by focusing his development on mastery of the art of socking huge dingers. I realize that this is pretty much exactly what every organization is saying to every player in the minors at every opportunity. I realize, too, that this is what the sport itself is communicating to everyone, everywhere, all the time: If you would like to play baseball in the majors, the surest way is by learning to wham the ball over that wall. 
Caglianone&#x27;s case is special. For one thing, the Royals have a profound need in their lineup for someone even remotely dingerish. As of Monday morning, Kansas City&#x27;s puny hitters have combined to sock just 34 homers in 60 games, by a hideous margin the fewest in the majors, and just more than a third as many as have been whammo&#x27;d by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Cal Raleigh, mighty sockdolaging catcher for the Seattle Mariners, has already clobbered 23. It&#x27;s not by design. &quot;There are too many good players in that room,&quot; said frustrated manager Matt Quatraro, way back in April, after his team was shut down by Max Fried of the New York Yankees. &quot;It&#x27;s part of baseball.

                              <span>By sheer power of will, determination, and lots and lots and lots of money, FIFA is looking to turn the previously irrelevant Club World Cup into a quadrennial summer-time blockbuster. Traditionally, the event has been a global supercup of sorts, each year pitting the seven winners of FIFA&#x27;s seven federations&#x27; continental tournaments against each other in a brief, midseason contest that virtually nobody really cared about. This month will bring the inaugural edition of the new-look CWC, a 32-team behemoth that will cram an already over-stuffed soccer calendar with yet another competition that nobody asked for.
It will take a lot of work to make this tournament into something fans care about. For the players and clubs involved, however, there are hundreds of millions of reasons why they&#x27;re willing to cut into their already vanishingly small rest and recovery time to try their damnedest to win. In its effort to make this whole thing matter, FIFA has filled the prize pool with ungodly sums of money, enticing participants with lucrative payouts that can rise up to $125 million for the winners. That&#x27;s almost one Florian Wirtz, if reports are to be believed, which should ensure that clubs like Real Madrid—who just paid Liverpool €10 million to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold early enough for him to play in the group stage of the CWC—and freshly crowned Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain will provide a good showing.</span>
