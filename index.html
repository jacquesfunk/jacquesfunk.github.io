                              <span>It’s easy to hate Blake Lively. She&#x27;s beautiful. She&#x27;s tall. Her hair is so lush. Her skin is so smooth. She&#x27;s married to a damn Marvel actor, and they have beautiful children. Her best friend is Taylor Swift. In a world of demure, close-lipped smirks, Lively has a megawatt full-teeth smile. She was born in Los Angeles and raised by a talent scout and an actor. She was a cheerleader in high school. Relative to a celebrity like Jennifer Lawrence, Lively does not seem particularly approachable or down-to-earth; she seems much more like a goddess sent to give you body dysmorphia. She&#x27;s the popular girl, and always has been. But those are all reasons based in envy.
Then, of course, there are the real reasons to hate her. Lively has been in the spotlight since Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants premiered in 2005, almost two decades ago. That&#x27;s a lifetime in Hollywood, and plenty of time to make mistakes that everyone can see. And Lively&#x27;s actual mistakes have been bad ones. In 2012, she married Ryan Reynolds on a plantation in South Carolina, a decision she apologized for eight years later in 2020. This was, somehow, not a one-off; in 2014, Lively launched a (very short-lived) online lifestyle magazine called Preserve, which included a spread titled “Allure of Antebellum.” As Kara Brown wrote for Jezebel at the time, “Anyone who romanticizes our nation&#x27;s Antebellum period as some sort of marker of style and taste is definitely white and probably an asshole.”</span>

                              <span>This is the time of year when the best, biggest, and most ambitious movies come out. Not Oscar season, but rather that stretch when the halls of streaming services are decked with the brightly lit, thinly disguised advertisements that are the year&#x27;s new Christmas movies. There are more than 100 new Christmas films to watch this holiday season, and whether that number horrifies or excites you depends upon how much of a freak you are for the festive. Sabrina is proud to say they are a real Christmas freak, and this year they asked some of their colleagues to watch some of the most, uh, available new holiday movies. The final movie in our lineup is The Merry Gentlemen, Netflix&#x27;s answer to the longstanding question: How will Chad Michael Murray withstand the ravages of time?
Sabrina: Well, well, well. It’s come to this: the finale of Defector Watches A Christmas Movie. Thank you both for experiencing this movie with me, and thank you Justin for shepherding this series. Let’s get right to it: This movie operates on the premise that a big-city girl must help save her parent’s local small-town nightclub. Did your hometowns have a local nightclub? Did you ever go there, and would you consider it worth saving?</span>

This was one of the series I was most jealous of before I joined Defector because it seemed so fun. That maybe makes it even funnier that the very first book I suggested (and the one we ended up choosing) is the biggest bummer DRAB has ever seen.
I first came across Young Men And Fire in a McNally Jackson earlier this year; I remember my attention being caught by the promise of an in-depth look at the Smokejumpers, who I’d been sort of lowkey obsessed with since reading Nora Roberts’ Chasing Fire. I’d never heard of the Mann Gulch fire or Norman Maclean really, though I realized after we picked this book that he also wrote A River Runs Through It, which I’ve seen the movie adaptation of. All to say, I was pretty stoked when y’all agreed to read it. What piqued y’alls interest?</span>

                              <span>Let&#x27;s start with a flaw. Liverpool&#x27;s defense is still the best in the Premier League, having allowed 13 goals in 15 matches entering Sunday&#x27;s trip to North London for a match against often-feisty but currently-shambolic Tottenham Hotspur. Virgil van Dijk is back to world-beating form, and his various partners in the center—often Ibrahima Konaté, though not for the past two months, thanks to a knee injury—have been competent enough to lead the league in goals against. However, there have been some cracks showing, and Liverpool&#x27;s two previous league matches saw that dominant defense give up five combined goals to Newcastle and Fulham.
Both of those matches ended in draws, only the third and fourth blemishes in Liverpool&#x27;s league season so far, and though it is unfair to put the entirety of the blame on the defense, it certainly didn&#x27;t help. And so, if one were to look at just how many goals Liverpool gave up on Sunday against Tottenham, it would read like another bad day at the office for van Dijk and co. Thankfully, soccer is played in both directions, and Tottenham&#x27;s three goals on its home ground only felt like feeble attempts at holding off the siege that was Liverpool&#x27;s high-line-abusing attack, which scored six goals but probably could have scored 10.</span>

                              <span>Tyson Fury once broke an opponent’s spirit with a story. He was set to fight Wladimir Klitschko, who’d been in possession of at least one major heavyweight belt for a full decade, looking near invincible throughout his run. Few expected Fury to do much before getting knocked out. Then, in a sit-down face-off, Fury recounted a tale of a long-ago training camp in which he outlasted Klitschko in a sauna, making it out to be a battle of wills. Just before Fury revealed that Klitschko departed the hot box first, Wlad gulped like somebody was holding him at gunpoint. Fury was equally effective in the ring, so bamboozling Klitschko with feints and twitches that the longtime champion seemingly forgot to throw punches. Fury won, then rubbed a tub of salt into the wound by serenading his wife with a harrowing version of Aerosmith’s “I Don’t Want To Miss a Thing.” Klitschko stood feet away, perhaps daydreaming of new career paths and better singers.
Fury figured never to meet an opponent he couldn’t out-talk. He approached the brash knockout artist Deontay Wilder with a furious torrent of psychological warfare, then knocked him out twice in their trilogy. He surely has said the word “dosser” more than any other boxer, or Earth resident. He could be at turns nasty, earnest, bigoted, kind, or silent, but he inevitably snuck into his foes’ heads and mangled their brains before he even started punching them.</span>

                              <span>Snickers Milk Chocolate Bark features a thin layer of milk chocolate mixed with pieces of Snickers candy bar.

A 5-oz pouch cost me $3.49 with a 30% off coupon (it&#x27;s normally $4.99).



If you&#x27;re a fan of Snickers, these were disappointing right out of the bag (it should be noted that this is a licensed product made by Morris National, Inc. rather than Mars Wrigley). The chocolate was very smooth for bark. The Snickers pieces were more like tiny chopped bits that left very little impression of the caramel, nougat, and peanut combination of a Snickers bar. Instead of gooey caramel, there were tiny bits of chewy, sticky caramel.
The chocolate was pretty average with a smooth texture and sweet and creamy with mild chocolate notes.



Overall, Snickers Milk Chocolate Bark was a miss for me. It&#x27;s easy enough to eat but very disappointing regarding any Snickers quality and as chocolate bark in general.

                              <span>To celebrate the 2024 holiday season, McDonald&#x27;s introduces the new, limited-time Christmas Truffle Cheese Burger in South Korea.

The Christmas Truffle Cheese Burger (pictured) features a breaded mashed potato and three-cheese patty inspired by the French dish aligot--a fondue-like dish made by blending cheese into mashed potatoes. The patty is served with a beef patty, tomato, lettuce, cheese, and a savory truffle sauce on a toasted sesame seed bun.
A similar setup is available for breakfast in the Christmas Truffle Cheese Muffin. The breakfast sandwich includes the same cheesy mashed potato patty, truffle sauce, cheese, and tomato on a toasted English muffin.
Also new for the holiday season is the Merry Berry McFizz, which sees raspberry syrup added to either Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Zero, or Sprite.

                              <span>Such is the strength of the hellish vortex Manchester City is presently trapped in—Saturday&#x27;s loss at Aston Villa gives the Mancs just one win from their last 12—that you almost have to start taking performances against them with a pinch of salt. City has shat the bed so regularly, keeping just one clean sheet over this stretch of misery, that it&#x27;s risky to read too much into what otherwise might appear to be a statement win against the Citizens. For proof of this notion, look no further than Tottenham.
With that in mind, when you look at the scoresheet from that 2-1 Villa win and see Jhon Durán&#x27;s name there, you may be tempted to discount what the goal says about the forward&#x27;s talent. This would be a mistake, because Durán is scoring all the time, against everyone.</span>

                              <span>The College Football Playoff is a wild hit so far, in that everyone hates it. Notre Dame beat Indiana Friday in a spectacular nothingburger that turned out to be the closest game of the weekend, and the three Saturday games were the competitive equivalent of Week 2 bodybag games decided by an aggregate score of 118-51. Even the gambling conglomerates were screaming and flipping off their gigantic monitors.

                              <span>Arrogance is that most remarkable of pejoratives because it wears Janus&#x27;s mask—a bad thing in normal society but an absolute requirement in all the arts. It is never enough to have the gift; one must strut it as well. There&#x27;s way more money in being the guest of honor and the DJ simultaneously, even if the self-promotional moves are now boilerplate behavior for those who have to pimp their own ride.
Which is why, in the end, Rickey Henderson, who died Friday at 65 years old, was not merely arrogant and justifiably so, but the next step beyond merely arrogant. He had the gift, but he also knew that he didn&#x27;t need to sell himself except to himself, because (a) he was his own best audience, as great performers tend to be, and (b) he figured that eventually everyone else would have to see it his way. And in this case, he was right.</span>

                              <span>Trader Joe&#x27;s English Toffee Ice Cream features brown butter ice cream with chocolatey-coated toffee and almonds.

A pint was $3.79.
The brown butter ice cream was smooth, rich, creamy, and dense with a nice, buttery caramel note to it. The toffee provided a similar but bolder flavor and a mild dose of chocolate. The almond contributed a slight nuttiness.



Both provided a bit of crunch with the toffee offering a slight sticky chewiness as well.
If you&#x27;re a fan of chunky ice cream along the lines of Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s, Trader Joe&#x27;s English Toffee Ice Cream might disappoint. The toffee bits and almonds were quite small and only made very occasional appearances in the eating experience.



As a fan of English toffee, I liked Trader Joe&#x27;s English Toffee Ice Cream as it provided a rather nuanced and layered take on the flavor. That being said, I would have liked more or at least bigger pieces of toffee and almonds.

He&#x27;s perfectly cast for a man who thinks Lawrence Welk is the cutting edge.
Thus, it was right and proper that he be the one to return the fair catch kick to our notice by stealing a last-second three-banger right before halftime of last night&#x27;s Amazonapalooza in which Harbaugh&#x27;s Los Angeles Chargers defeated the almost as old but not nearly so physically arresting Sean Payton and the Denver Broncos. An arcane enclave of the rulebook which was successfully employed as recently as 1976, when Harbaugh was spiritually already in his mid-40s, the fair catch kick can be employed only on a fair catch as time expires, or a penalty on a fair catch, which the Broncos&#x27; Tremon Smith gifted the Chargers on a punt that Derius Davis tried to collect with no time left on the clock. The 15-yard penalty took the ball from the Charger 38 to the Bronco 47 and offered an untimed play to provide the punishment for the penalty that would otherwise go unpunished—why, you could hear the oldey-timey gears in a million old coaches&#x27; heads at the possibilities. “It’s my favorite rule in football,” Harbaugh said.</span>

                              <span>Babygirl, a movie written and directed by Dutch filmmaker Halina Reijn and starring Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson, is about facades. It&#x27;s also about sex, but less about sex itself and more about what sex says about a person, and the ways we suppress our sexual appetites in order for it to say nothing about us at all. Babygirl, Reijn&#x27;s second English-language film after 2022&#x27;s Bodies Bodies Bodies, taps into a conservative cultural moment that is firmly anti-sex while still being in sex&#x27;s thrall. It is the subject everyone wants to talk about but no one wants to see, or seemingly even have.
The movie follows tech CEO Romy Mathis (Kidman), an unabashed, all-caps GIRLBOSS who nominally &quot;has it all&quot;: a powerful job, a big office, an eager assistant who looks up to her, a seemingly well-adjusted family that includes two daughters and a hot theater director for a husband (Antonio Banderas). But there is a restless beast inside of Romy, and vanilla sex with her husband can&#x27;t appease it—so much so that Romy often finds herself having to watch dom-play porn in the bathroom afterwards in order to actually reach an orgasm. When a much younger intern for the company arrives, Samuel (Dickinson), she slowly finds herself ensnared in his web, and discovers that he is up for taming that beast. Both in spite and because of the power dynamics and the threat their affair poses to her life and career, they begin an ill-advised relationship that is hot and steamy, but most importantly effective and passionate. Romy finds her sexual needs met for the first time, which, in this movie, is as important as the tension or thriller aspects at play.</span>

                              <span>In the narrow, highly specialized field of fish with blob-like attributes, one fish has dominated for decades: One would hardly dare imagine a blobbish fish without first thinking of the blobfish. But has a new blobby fish emerged to unseat this age-old champion of blobdom?
Today, a group of researchers from the nonprofit Conservation International published a report of 27 new species discovered in Alto Mayo, a region in the Peruvian Amazon. Each of the species was a singular delight: the amphibious mouse that dwells in palm swamps called aguajales; the small, stubby chestnut-colored salamander that climbs trees. But as I scrolled through the report, one species was a clear standout—a born star, never readier to accept its place in the spotlight. This, of course, was the blob-headed fish.</span>

                              <span>In an industry-wide first, the National Labor Relations Board argued last week that contestants participating in Netflix’s hit reality TV dating show Love Is Blind should be classified as employees. If implemented into policy—which, admittedly, seems unlikely given the fact that Donald Trump is expected to fire the current NLRB general legal counsel—the filing could not only give more on-set protection to participants of shows like Love Is Blind but potentially allow them to unionize. 
Since its oddly prescient premiere in February 2020, which saw 15 men and 15 women dating, falling in love and eventually getting engaged sight unseen, Love Is Blind has faced allegations of mistreatment and coercion. Early contestants have accused producers of plying them with alcohol while regularly denying them food and water; one contestant alleged that production pushed her to continue filming even after she told them that she was experiencing suicidal ideation and wanted to leave. Over the past four years and seven seasons, the two production companies behind Love Is Blind—Kinetic Content and Delirium TV—have faced multiple lawsuits from former contestants. One of them alleges “inhumane working conditions” while another accuses Kinetic and Delirium of negligence, false imprisonment and sexual assault.</span>

                              <span>While Christmas and the holiday season at McDonald&#x27;s in the US largely consists of the Holiday Pie and holiday cups, over in the UK, the chain offers a whole holiday menu each year that includes seasonal burgers/sandwiches, a side, and desserts. They call it the &quot;Festive Food Range.&quot;

Here&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll find on the 2024 holiday menu at McDonald&#x27;s in the United Kingdom:


New Cheesy McCrispy - A crispy-fried chicken breast filet served with lettuce, crispy-fried onions, pickled onion chutney, bacon, Emmental cheese, and &quot;deluxe&quot; cheese sauce on a toasted sesame seed sourdough-style bun.
Big Tasty - A beef patty, cheese made with Emmental (similar to processed Swiss cheese), onions, tomatoes, and Big Tasty sauce (a smoky, creamy sauce), served on a toasted sesame seed bun.
Cheese Melt Dippers with Rich Tomato Dip - Breaded and fried rounds of cheese dippers made with Camembert and served with a tomato dip.
Terry&#x27;s Orange Chocolate Pie - A chocolaty turnover-style pie filled with a Terry’s Chocolate Orange-flavored chocolate ganache.
Galaxy Caramel Latte - A latte blended with Galaxy Caramel-flavored syrup, topped with caramel cream and Galaxy Chocolate stars. Galaxy in the UK is what we know as Dove chocolate.
Galaxy Caramel Hot Chocolate - Hot chocolate with Galaxy Caramel-flavored syrup, topped with caramel cream and Galaxy Chocolate stars.
Galaxy Caramel McFlurry - Vanilla soft serve mixed with Galaxy Chocolate stars and topped with a Galaxy Caramel sauce.
Terry&#x27;s Chocolate Orange McFlurry - Vanilla soft serve swirled with mini segments of Terry’s Chocolate Orange and topped with a Terry’s Chocolate Orange sauce.


In addition to the Festive Food Range, McDonald&#x27;s UK also has a Grinch Happy Meal that includes a Grinch-themed box:



Toys for the holiday Happy Meal include Grinch and Max plushies and three different card games:
