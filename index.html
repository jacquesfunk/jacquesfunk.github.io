                              <span>The race reports following each of the past 29 editions of the men&#x27;s Milan–San Remo, the first monument classic of the cycling season, are more or less identical, save for the proper nouns. The peloton races down from Milan onto the coast of the Ligurian Sea for like six hours and, after being softened up by all that racing through foreboding spring conditions and one ascent of the Cipressa around 20 kilometers from the line, the race is decided by the ascent and descent of the Poggio, a sinuous and otherwise unremarkable climb made totally decisive by all that softening up. Oddly, the race&#x27;s structural predictability (matched only by La Fleche Wallone) lends itself to an unpredictability of outcome. You never knew who will win, but you know how they will win.
That is, until this past weekend&#x27;s men&#x27;s race, which not only ended with Mathieu van der Poel repeating his 2023 triumph, but saw a wholly different kind of finish. It was the best Milan–San Remo I&#x27;ve seen in my time watching pro cycling, a testament to the greatness of both van der Poel and Tadej Pogacar, and the possibility of their rivalry.</span>

Surely next week we&#x27;ll have more eloquent things to say about this three-month journey into the heart of our creative souls. Or, perhaps, we will be so broken and filled with dread that even the promise of being among the proud few to actually complete the The Artist&#x27;s Way will not fill us with joy. For now we&#x27;re trying to get through the last few days of morning pages. 
Will this next week mark the beginning of our new lives as enlightened artists? Will one (or many) of us burn the book when we&#x27;re done? Will the next time you see us be on a Broadway stage? Only time will tell.</span>

                              <span>The funny thing about getting invested in the race for the wild card is that, by definition, none of the teams involved are very good. Montreal is improbably clinging to the last playoff spot in the East right now mostly because they&#x27;re not losing in regulation. The Islanders, with their minus-16 goal differential (better than Montreal&#x27;s!), are right behind them for similar reasons. The Rangers have lost seven of their last 10. The Blue Jackets just ended a six-game skid by squeaking one out against the Isles. And finally, before we reach the completely unsalvageable wreckage, we have the Detroit Red Wings, currently experiencing the comedown after the coaching-change hot streak that rocketed them back into relevancy around New Year&#x27;s.
The Wings, last among the not-good teams, are really not good. They tricked people into thinking they might be when they ripped off a couple of seven-game win streaks in close proximity, but this is a squad that still hasn&#x27;t found a goalie solution, has struggled to make smart veteran acquisitions, and is stuck waiting on talent development to usher in a turnaround. Since the end of the international break, they&#x27;ve plummeted down the standings, and entering Monday&#x27;s first-ever franchise trip to Utah they&#x27;d won just four of their last 14. Facing the Hockey Clubs—another group that badly needs to scrounge up some points to sneak into the playoffs—the Wings, honestly, turned in another poor performance. But despite barely getting the puck on net, a couple of silly/frustrating goals delivered them the worst-looking 5-1 victory I&#x27;ve ever seen.</span>

                              <span>Over the course of nearly a decade, Gisele Pelicot of Mazan, France, was drugged and raped by her husband and as many as 83 other men he invited to do so. Presented with the option to prosecute the case privately, Gisele instead insisted on a public trial. Sophie Smith writes in an essay for The London Review of Books: “Her hope – and in this she is not alone – is that by publicising the behaviour such a society produces, the trial will be a step towards changing it.” The accomplices of Gisele’s husband, Dominique, variously admitted their guilt or rejected the use of “rape” outright. Several men repeated the line, “I am not a rapist,” with added justifications that Gisele must have known what was happening, that it was all a game, that she actually wanted the encounter to happen. “Liar, slut, loudmouth, killjoy: as is often true of rape trials, the best defense is one able to transform the victim into a contemptible Medusa, to make of the accuser the accused,” writes Jamie Hood, author of the new memoir Trauma Plot, in a recent Bookforum review of Virginie Despentes’s novel Dear Dickhead that begins with Pelicot’s trial. 
In Trauma Plot, Hood delineates her experience surviving three rapes through a prismatic formal lens. Each chapter of the memoir switches from a first, second, or third-person perspective, charting Hood’s time in grad school in Boston and her subsequent relocation to Brooklyn, while also weaving in threads from her childhood. But time, in Hood’s hands, is anything but linear. Hood destabilizes what might be deemed the tidy story of rape and gendered violence, the narrative that claims narrative is even a suitable form with which to contain trauma. “Everywhere I went, rape followed. Rape was the little phrase repeated through the score of my life.”</span>

                              <span>Thanks to some serendipitous scheduling, Manchester City and Chelsea are three-quarters of the way through a four-game series that started on March 15 with the League Cup final. It will end this Thursday, with the second leg of a Champions League quarterfinal tie. So far, this is a series that&#x27;s shown us the best of what the WSL has to offer.
It takes high-quality players and high stakes to turn a quirk of the schedule into a season-defining series, and this one has loads of both. For Chelsea, the WSL&#x27;s undisputed hegemon, these games presented an opportunity not only to continue their pursuit of a multi-trophy season, but to put Manchester City back in its place. Chelsea has failed to win the WSL title just once in the last eight seasons, but were pushed to the brink by City last season, which ended with Chelsea claiming their fifth consecutive title, but only on goal difference. For City, these four games brought with them the opportunity to salvage what is a season gone awry. City currently sits fourth in the WSL table, having regressed so far from last season&#x27;s heights that they are 15 points behind Chelsea at the top of the table and seven points out of the Champions League places. And yet, 12 straight days spent as Chelsea&#x27;s biggest obstacle to completing the treble left plenty to play for.</span>

                              <span>The Los Angeles Lakers dropped a game to the Magic Monday night, 118–106, in Orlando. There are worse things. The Magic are experiencing a rare patch of reasonable health, and in an otherwise nearly lost regular season they&#x27;ve managed to hold their heads above water at their home arena. Losing stinks—Nuke LaLoosh would say it&#x27;s, like, worse than winning—but for the Lakers this is just a loss. Rub some dirt on it, I say.
Far more troubling was the home loss Saturday night to the Chicago Bulls. This was supposed to be a get-well game, with LeBron James returning to action following a seven-game absence to tend to a groin injury. The Bulls aren&#x27;t exactly food, having now won 10 of 15 to pull into the East&#x27;s ninth seed, but that&#x27;s a second- or third-rate basketball operation over there, on the precipice of another gruesome rebuild, and the Lakers think of themselves as contenders. With James returning, and in the final game of the last significant homestand of the season, and with designs on righting a recently wayward ship, you would expect the Lakers to make a statement against so measly a foe. Instead, the visitors summarily karate-chopped the Lakers&#x27; buttcheeks to hamburger, in a drubbing so severe that Bronny James was given almost seven minutes of supervised sandbox time (naturally he missed all four of his shot attempts). The guys who shredded the Lakers are just guys: Coby White put up 36 points on 17 shots; Josh Giddey came two steals shy of a goddamn quadruple-double, and posted 17 assists to just two turnovers. Matas Buzelis (in fairness, he might someday become more than a guy) went for a career-high 31 points.</span>

                              <span>George Foreman could take a punch. 
Foreman, who died Friday at his home in Houston, was better known for other things. Like, most obviously, throwing a punch. He’s remembered as one of the hellaciousest hitters the sweet science ever saw, and his ring record (76-5 with 68 knockouts) and lots of YouTube highlights bolster that. The uninitiated can and should watch him seemingly lift Joe Frazier off the ground with a shot in 1973, or send former great white hope Gerry Cooney into retirement for good some 17 years later, or transport Michael Moorer to LaLa Land in late 1994. And outside the squared circle, Foreman famously shilled no-frills grills, and named all five of his sons George.</span>

                              <span>JuJu Watkins will miss the rest of the NCAA tournament with an injury she sustained in USC’s second-round game against Mississippi State, the team announced late Monday night. ESPN’s Shams Charania reported that the sophomore guard tore her ACL in her right knee. 
Watkins was carried off the floor by trainers just five minutes into Monday night’s game. To fans of Watkins, the sequence before the injury might have looked familiar. Her transition burst, and her rarer ability to change pace—to decelerate—make her one of the best players in college basketball. On a fast break in the first quarter, she seemed ready to bring both skills to bear against two defenders. But as the Bulldogs players caught up to her on the other end of the court, and as she tried to stop and swerve around them, Watkins fell and screamed in pain.</span>

                              <span>Chinook salmon start their lives high upstream in the rivers of western North America. The young fish linger in the safety of freshwater until they are big enough to head out into the open ocean, where they can live for up to five years. At sea, the salmon shine blue-green and glint silver. When the fish head back upriver, however, they flush into warmer hues: olive browns, reds, and purples. The jaws of the males lengthen and hook. The salmon almost always return to the exact stream in which they were born, following the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field like a compass. There, the salmon meet, mate, and prepare to die.
At this stage of the salmon&#x27;s life, they become &quot;gruesome zombie fish,&quot; said Sara Hugentobler, a fish biologist who worked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the hatchery evaluation program in Red Bluff, Calif. &quot;They&#x27;re losing scales. They&#x27;re losing tissue. You can see exposed bone.&quot; But this orgy of death leaves behind a bounty of carcasses—a buffet for bears and other scavengers. And whatever flesh, bone, and scales remain sink to the riverbed and become fertilizer for more life. &quot;They&#x27;re a really important ecological part of the environment,&quot; Hugentobler said.</span>

They’re still out there, but they’ve become minor players thanks to the revolution that followed players winning the right to get paid and transfer from program to program—only a nonagenarian or certified delusional still refers to them as &quot;schools&quot; in this context—until they get the fit or payday they want. In this new order, the general managers and athletic directors who make sure those payments come on time have taken over the top of the perception food chain; for every Tom Izzo, Rick Barnes, or Matt Painter, there is an army of younger, more mobile, and less martinet-ish new guys who lead with the smooth for the new generation of employees—less coaches than managers.
Fortunately, though, there is still Dan Hurley to corner the tantrum market.</span>

                              <span>My son was on a mission. Simon has been walking since December, and he’s getting more confident each day. He’d spotted something, and was scooting down the aisle as fast as he could towards it. He wanted to play in the clothing racks.
They were empty. The store was full of people, but all that remained was plus-size women’s clothing priced at 3-for-$5. Even most of the mannequins had been purchased; rental trucks idled outside as buyers loaded them up with fixtures from the store. Philadelphia’s flagship Macy’s was closing; signs declared it the “final few hours.” I was there with my son, my wife, and my parents. Some guy was riding his bike through the store, which is about when we figured it was OK to let Simon run around. After spending some time entranced by a jewelry case, he found the clothing racks.</span>

                              <span>Back in the late 2010s, my wife and I took our kids to Los Angeles for spring break. Being the good little tourist family that we were, we used the occasion to visit Universal Studios Hollywood, which included a Wizarding World of Harry Potter sub-park at its far end. This was back when my kids found Harry Potter interesting, and right as Potter author J.K. Rowling was committing herself to becoming a culture warrior of the most tiresome sort. We enjoyed all of the magical offerings that Potterworld had on display. The virtual roller coaster (Universal has a lot of them). The actual roller coaster (underwhelming). Ollivanders Wand Shop (endless line for what was ultimately just a gift shop). It was a good time, but hardly a memorable one. What was memorable, however, was the butterbeer.
If you know your Potter lore, and I do to a casual extent, you know that butterbeer was served at the pub in the town of Hogsmeade. I loved beer, and I loved butter, so the second that I saw the word “butterbeer” in the books, I wanted one. I could taste it just by staring at that word for seconds at a time: thick, foamy, sweet like butterscotch. When I’d finished the entire Potter saga, the desire hadn’t abated a whit. I said to myself, “Fuck me, I’d love to drink a butterbeer.”</span>

                              <span>Max Muncy will make the opening day roster. So far, so normal. Max Muncy plays for the Sacramento A&#x27;s. [Monocle pops out of my eye and into my champagne; it is unclear why I was wearing that or drinking that.]
Yes, there&#x27;s a new Max Muncy in town. This one is a middle infielder, is 22 years old, and was a first-round pick in 2021. He&#x27;s listed as the organization&#x27;s No. 7 prospect mostly thanks to his stellar defense, and he&#x27;s got a little bit of pop in his bat. Max Muncy is not to be confused with Max Muncy, the 34-year-old Dodgers corner infielder. Two totally different guys! Even though both were drafted by the Athletics, and both have August 25 birthdays.</span>

                              <span>No baseball reporter delivers the goods as consistently as USA Today&#x27;s Bob Nightengale, by which I mean nobody else in his field possesses even one percent of his ability to make dispassionately tweeting news and information related to Major League Baseball a constant struggle. Bob attempting to break free agency news? A riot. Bob confidently sharing photos that look like they were taken from inside of a vaseline jar? Always kills. Bob just inventing and then getting really hung up on the idea of the $10 Million Club? I laughed all day.
On Sunday, Bob struck again. While everyone was just trying to relax and watch some college basketball, Bob attempted to share a heartfelt message about the death of sports columnist Bryce Miller. Instead, he briefly sent the entire city of Philadelphia into a panic:</span>

                              <span>A one-possession NCAA tournament game with seconds on the clock can induce as much dread as anticipation. For as often as situations like these produce iconic buzzer-beaters, they just as often fall victim to college basketball&#x27;s inherent jankiness—subpar coaches drawing up doomed sets and skittish players momentarily forgetting which direction their basket is. It&#x27;s a blessing to get one great shot out of a scenario like this; on Sunday night, Colorado State and Maryland gave us two.
The teams that successfully navigate these moments tend to be the ones that have a good idea of who they are and what they want to do. After Maryland&#x27;s Julian Reese hit two free throws to give his team a 70-68 lead with 22 seconds left, CSU head coach Niko Medved didn&#x27;t like what he saw as his team raced up the floor and struggled to get into an offensive set. He called a timeout with 12 seconds left, and while the Rams huddled up, there was no doubt who would be getting the ball on the next possession.</span>

                              <span>First, the apologetics. Barbecue sauce is not a necessity—not even and maybe especially not even to the making of good barbecue, but also just in general: You do not really ever need barbecue sauce, except perhaps where you expect the meat clad in it to come out otherwise dry or bland or underwhelming, and you can and should expect more of your barbecue efforts than to assume their products will need this help.
Now let&#x27;s drive back in the other direction a little bit. Barbecue sauce is fine! It tastes good and it&#x27;s fun, and making it is easy, and even excellent barbecue certainly isn&#x27;t harmed by the option of drizzling or brushing it with something tart and sweet and hot and sticky. If barbecue sauce is not a need-to-have type of thing, then it is for sure a nice-to-have type of thing.</span>

When I texted my roommate, &quot;what if we became board game people...&quot; I didn&#x27;t think it would come to this: two board games purchased to start and then, a week later, two more on the way and an all-consuming obsession with Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 that has resulted in playing 13 games in a little over a week. There is a lesson to be learned here about YouTube rabbit holes that see you watching hours of British men reviewing board games, but it&#x27;s already too late to interrogate.</span>

                              <span>If last year was any indication, two races is far too early to bang the gavel on Championship domination—but for structure&#x27;s sake, let&#x27;s save McLaren for last anyway. The Chinese Grand Prix is one of six sprint race weekends on the calendar this year, and in typical fashion, the sprint spoiled the contours of the feature race, if not the final results—a newly repaved tarmac that grinds through medium compound tires, combined with a track that makes for difficult passing without significant tire advantage. Then, Lewis Hamilton demonstrated some much-needed dominance for Ferrari, converting a sprint-qualifying pole into a tire-management masterclass until the end; there was even a vintage tire complaint over the radio before he pulled away from the rest of the field.
In typical Ferrari fashion, the good signs did not last very long. Whatever setup tweaks were made between the sprint race and qualifying proved a disaster. The race itself provided a laundry list of misfortunes. Neither Hamilton nor Charles Leclerc impressed in qualifying, while Oscar Piastri took his first pole in Formula 1. On the first lap of the race, Hamilton and Leclerc made contact as both cars passed Max Verstappen&#x27;s Red Bull, damaging Leclerc&#x27;s front wing. (One lucky break: The damaged wing barely affected Leclerc&#x27;s pace.) Later, Hamilton, unable to find the pace in the car, suggested a driver swap to his race engineer.</span>

                              <span>The entire production of KiiiKiii&#x27;s &quot;Debut Song&quot; reeks of maliciousness, or maybe that&#x27;s just a kneejerk reaction to watching the K-pop machinery discover irony. To start, &quot;Debut Song&quot; is not actually a debut song; it is a &quot;pre-release single,&quot; or additional promotional material that happens to come in the form of a song, as part of a prolonged rollout before the group&#x27;s official launch. KiiiKiii—that’s three i&#x27;s, twice—started promotions on February 24 and will only officially debut a month later on March 24. Both &quot;Debut Song&quot; and its music video aren&#x27;t meant to be taken very seriously. It&#x27;s a referential satire on the industry; it&#x27;s all in good fun.

                              <span>The sports media industry is an aviary filled with odd birds, especially when it comes to food. Al Michaels claims he&#x27;s never had a vegetable in his life. Mel Kiper supposedly eats a slice of pumpkin pie each morning, and prefers pizza with mashed potatoes in lieu of cheese. At this point, Skip Bayless is more chicken and broccoli than man. The case of Front Office Sports media reporter Ryan Glasspiegel, previously of the New York Post and Clay Travis&#x27;s OutKick, is not nearly as finicky, but it&#x27;s fascinating nonetheless. I&#x27;d be underselling it by saying that this guy has opinions on fast casual dining. It&#x27;s as if he saw Newt Gingrich&#x27;s old tweet about a McDonald&#x27;s snack wrap and chose to turn it into an ethos.</span>

What makes an industry plant? Apparently this is the music internet&#x27;s greatest concern. The train of thought is well-established: Is that big artist really as big as everyone says? I don&#x27;t listen to them and I like to believe I&#x27;ve got my finger on the pulse. How can I verify what&#x27;s organic and what&#x27;s artificial?</span>

                              <span>At this point, it would be hard to blame anyone for coming to the conclusion that the Dallas Mavericks will never climb out of this pit. The Luka Doncic trade, which only gets more shocking and stupid as time goes on, is the biggest piece of evidence in support of such a conclusion, but so is the fact that the entire organization has subsequently become snakebitten and overcome by an oafish spirit. Nothing good happens to this team anymore, and it can do nothing right.
Even the in-arena entertainment is suffering. Fans who attended Sunday&#x27;s game against the 76ers—a 130-125 loss in which Quentin Grimes, the other guy the Mavs traded away at the deadline, led the Sixers with 28 points—were treated to a pregame hype video that can only be described as nightmarish. For more than 90 seconds, the jumbotron was taken over by AI-generated facsimiles of various Mavericks players pulling uncanny and haunting expressions while skittering and jerking across the screen.</span>

He was quickly surrounded by three McNeese State defenders, but moved the ball around his body, spun toward the basket, and threw up a layup. It bounced around before falling through. With that, the fifth-seeded Clemson Tigers trailed 12th-seeded McNeese State by four. It was halfway through the first half, and the Tigers would be trailing by a lot more by the time they hit another shot.
When Chauncey Wiggins hit a three about five minutes later, it cut the Cowboys’ lead to 12. Things did not get much better from there. Clemson managed just one more field goal in the first half, and had only four at halftime. After shooting 37.2 percent on threes during the season, Clemson proceeded to go 1-for-13 from distance in the first half. McNeese led 31-13 at the break, not merely doubling up Clemson but Going Palindromic on them. Per Kenpom, Clemson had the 24th-best offensive efficiency in the country coming into the tournament. And then the Cowboys put a lid on the bucket.</span>

                              <span>The first thing to know about Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s latest book, Dream Count, is that it is about women. Four women, to be precise. (Why is it always that women are grouped into fours?) This is Adichie’s first book in 12 years, after she conquered the New York Times bestseller list with her novel Americanah, which secured her place in the canon as a supreme chronicler of the immigrant experience. But even though Dream Count is set in the Covid era, it’s as if no time since Americanah has passed at all. Adichie is hopelessly nostalgic for a feminism of yore. It may be best read in a pantsuit.
The novel features the loosely connected stories of Chiamaka, a winsome travel writer; Zikora, a lawyer whose boyfriend abandoned her while pregnant; Kadiatou, a hotel maid and Chiamaka’s housekeeper; and Omelegor, a scheming yet wayward businesswoman in Nigeria. Adichie’s understanding of what it means to be a woman is that when you’re not being abused by your own body, you are being let down or terrorized by men. Chiamaka, who goes through a string of truly reprehensible boyfriends, has fibroids that cause her to bleed through her pants. Zikora undergoes an excruciating birth and struggles to breastfeed after her baby after the father of her child ghosts her. Kadiatou is forced into having a clitorectomy as a child. And then there is the episode where Omelegor’s boob is slapped during sex, which inspires her to move to America to study pornography (she’s against it).</span>

This may not be true for the loyalists and degenerates who have an emotional or financial stake in the outcomes, but I treat the college basketball season and its giddy final act more or less the same way that I treated my classes in college: I do enough research to feel OK with myself and pass for informed, otherwise consume whatever feels right whenever it occurs to me, and try to bear in mind that it doesn&#x27;t really matter that much. I am roughly as good at filling out a bracket as I was at being a history major, and while I&#x27;m not a historian, I do have a diploma.</span>

                              <span>Consider the sugar beet, a sweet and tapered tuber. Unlike tropical sugarcane, sugar beets grow in temperate zones, enabling colder regions of the United States to farm their own sugar instead of relying on imports. From the late 19th century through the late 1970s, Utah abounded with sugar beet farms, and the crop&#x27;s presence influenced the state&#x27;s food culture. To Kate Wheeler, who until recently worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Food and Nutrition Service, the sugar beet is a perfect portal into the Farm to School movement. Students can learn about Utah&#x27;s history with the beet in social studies class. They can plant the beets in school gardens. And they can sample beets from nearby farms in the school cafeteria. Ideally, they&#x27;re doing all three.
This is the spirit of Farm to School, which is not a government program but a tool that makes those programs more effective, Wheeler explained. Farm to School can involve local procurement of food, nutritional education, and school gardens. But Wheeler believes the tool becomes stronger when all three of these wings are combined in classrooms, cafeterias, and the community. Students are learning about food and nutrition, they are being nourished during the school day, and local farmers are building connections to schools. &quot;This is a movement to change the way all of these other programs are interacting with the food system,&quot; she said.</span>

                              <span>Weeks after the Boston Celtics won the 2023–24 NBA championship, owner Wyc Grousbeck announced that the team was up for sale. Grousbeck was clearly selling as high as he possibly could, on the heels of a new owner-friendly CBA and a title and ahead of whatever massive economic turmoil the second Donald Trump administration is about to throw the country into. While the Celtics were going to fetch more than the then-record $4 billion Mat Ishbia paid for the Phoenix Suns in 2022, I was still surprised to see the eventual purchase price, announced Thursday morning: A group led by Bill Chisholm agreed to pay Grousbeck $6.1 billion, and will take over after the 2027–28 season.
That sum represents a seventeenfold increase on the price that Grousbeck and his co-owners paid in 2002, an exospheric leap that makes one wonder who exactly can afford to pay roughly the GDP of Sierra Leone for ownership of a sports team. Chisholm runs Symphony Technology Group, which is a private equity firm dedicated to hoovering up and degrading tech companies. In this sense, he&#x27;s the perfect owner for a sports team based in Boston, a hub for private equity firms both competent and incompetent, and he epitomizes the new ownership class that will gradually take over from an extant crop of owners who may soon look to sell into such a frothy market.</span>

                              <span>Detroit basketball fans have a new chant. In addition to the &quot;DE-TROIT BASKETBALL&quot; thing—more of a shout, really, but you take my meaning—they now chant &quot;M-V-P&quot; for young Cade Cunningham, who in his fourth NBA season has made The Leap. Cunningham is posting career highs in points, assists, defensive rebounds, blocks, usage, and scoring efficiency, and is the best player for a bonafide playoff team otherwise made up of well-meaning guys, plus Ausar Thompson (hell yeah) and Tobias Harris (gulp). Cunningham isn&#x27;t really a serious MVP contender—basically no one is in a league that contains both Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Nikola Jokic—but he&#x27;s earned this adoration. Anyway, he&#x27;s got about as good a case as anyone else in his shit-ass conference. Let them chant, I say.
The Pistons beat the Miami Heat Wednesday night, in a contest that was maybe a little bit closer than it should&#x27;ve been. The Heat stink. Shipping off Jimmy Butler may have removed a distraction but it left the roster with just one player, in Bam Adebayo, who is capable of making regular contributions at both ends in a rotation gig. The Pistons maybe aren&#x27;t exactly a powerhouse, but they&#x27;re supposed to handle this lousy Heat outfit. &quot;We just couldn&#x27;t find that momentum to put us ahead,&quot; said head coach J.B Bickerstaff, after the game. &quot;Every time it seemed like we were making a run, you&#x27;d look up and we were down by three.&quot; Cunningham mostly had an off night, shooting-wise, the Pistons struggled to produce clean three-pointers, and Erik Spoelstra&#x27;s lean 7.5-man rotation made headway against Detroit&#x27;s otherwise respectable bench units. It&#x27;s just like that sometimes, especially for teams that have only recently arrived at conditions of general competence.</span>

                              <span>So much of this portion of the NBA season feels sloggy and labored, even after you allow for the drama of multiple seedings battles—West places two through eight and also ten and eleven; East places four through six; the sewage gumbo of the Southeast Division—and the lopsided Vengeance Pageants being staged by Jimmy Butler against Miami and Luka Doncic against Dallas. The NBA season is very long, and never feels longer than it does right around now.
But then there are the moments of crystalline beauty at the edges of the league that catch even the most jaded fans unaware. When those happen, they should if possible include Flavor Flav.</span>

                              <span>Wednesday night, the Maple Leafs scored on a piece of improbably timed slapstick; Buster Keaton couldn&#x27;t have done better. Simply trying to clear the zone on a penalty kill, Simon Benoit—he of do-a-cool-punch-then-get-punched fame—put the puck around the boards. Referee Kelly Sutherland, preparing to get out of the way, tripped over his own skates, fell down, and stopped the puck with his prone body in perfect position for Steven Lorentz to skate in and score the shorty. It would prove the winner in a 2-1 Toronto win over Colorado.

                              <span>I did not want to be writing about Tom Izzo and Rick Pitino this week. You can find glowing features on each of those septuagenarian coaching legends from the past few days at various media outlets. They don’t need me to carry water for them; the two have won a combined 1400 games, three national titles, and 15 Final Fours. There is no denying they are great basketball coaches. This week, though, they have a chance to make a different kind of history. They can do it by overcoming a curse that has haunted the tournament since it expanded to 64 teams back in 1985.
My favorite fun fact related to the tournament is that no team with a one- or two-seed that was unranked in the preseason AP poll has made a Final Four during the 64-team era. Those teams are not the rare occurrence you might expect, either. There have been 39 cases of this over the past 39 tournaments. For 39 teams seeded among the field’s top eight teams to collectively whiff on a Final Four appearance is pretty staggering, and enough to make this fact not just fun, but actually meaningful.</span>

                              <span>On Tuesday night, ESPN MLB writer Jeff Passan shared that an innocuous article on the Department of Defense website honoring MLB legend Jackie Robinson&#x27;s sporting and military career had been removed. Trying to access the old page redirected to a new, inoperative page with a URL that had &quot;DEI&quot; jammed into it. The Robinson article was part of a series called &quot;Sports Heroes Who Served.&quot; Other such articles, like the one for fellow MLB Hall of Famer Bob Feller, remained live and un-DEI-ified. Now what could possibly explain the difference between Robinson and Feller?
The removal of the Robinson article followed an internal memo from Feb. 27, calling for a &quot;digital content refresh&quot; to &quot;remove and archive DOD news articles, photos, and videos promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.&quot; When asked about the removal of the page, DoD press secretary John Ullyot sent ESPN a statement, which is worth quoting in full for its self-satisfied derangement:</span>

                              <span>This morning I received what appeared to be blessed confirmation from NFL insider Tom Pelissero that the Minnesota Vikings were officially out of the Aaron Rodgers (snickering) sweepstakes. I had waited far, FAR too long for this news to drop. The Rodgers-Vikings connection only made sense to media members carrying water for a desperate, jobless Rodgers, and to casual observers who remembered Brett Favre joining the team in 2009. To everyone else, nearly all Vikings fans included, any suggestions that the team might be interested in Rodgers was as nonsensical as it was enraging. So I was grateful to Pelissero for putting the kibosh on all of that speculation and allowing me, at last, to bask in what has been a remarkable offseason for my team.
But Rodgers, like herpes, is a virus that refuses to die once inside your system. So here came Dianna Russini of The Athletic, vehemently attempting to keep the story alive by reporting that Minnesota was “simply not making a decision at this time.” That report, I could write off with ease, but then Vikings beat reporter Kevin Seifert of ESPN filed this report, buttressed by sources in Eagan, that officially kept the door 0.00000000000001 inches ajar.</span>

Anyone using it to predict their women’s tournament champion must first untangle this regular-season mess: No. 1 overall seed UCLA beat South Carolina, who went 2-1 against Texas this season but lost at home to UConn, who lost to Notre Dame and USC, who beat UCLA twice but lost to Notre Dame, who just lost three of their last five games. To choose our champion and build our own perfect bracket, we’ll have to study the six serious contenders more closely.</span>

I looked like this because I thought they had put a J-cloth, smeared in oil, behind a glass case and called it art. But then I looked closer—it took me a minute, but I noticed the material before the stiffness. I noticed that what I thought were those trademark zig-zaggy blue and white cellulose fibers were actually countless little blue and white glass beads, so expertly sewn together that this sculpture looked like any number of scrunched-up kitchen rags I had seen in my…</span>

To really hit &quot;a home run&quot; on Defector&#x27;s signature premium concession for the 2025 season, we turned to the one true genius on our staff: Chief AI/Metaverse Officer Devin The Mixed-Reality Dugong. Thanks to Devin&#x27;s work with our cutting-edge AI technology, our proprietary algorithm was able to generate the ideal sandwich for everyone to enjoy while watching a baseball game.</span>

                              <span>Novak Djokovic&#x27;s players union has mounted its most significant challenge to the governing superstructure of tennis. On Tuesday, the Professional Tennis Players Association, along with one dozen named professional tennis players, filed a sweeping lawsuit in U.S., U.K., and E.U. courts against the four most powerful agencies in global tennis: the International Tennis Federation, which oversees the administration of the Grand Slams and is the closest thing tennis has to an international governing body; the International Tennis Integrity Agency, which runs anti-doping; and the ATP and WTA tours. 
You can deduce a good deal about the strange, diffuse ways tennis is run through both the identity and quantity of both plaintiffs and defendants. This legal battle is, at heart, a conflict between labor and management over the latter&#x27;s control of the former&#x27;s production, though the PTPA is not technically a union of salaried employees and management is less a cohesive unit than an assemblage of interconnected bodies. The ATP, for its part, is partially constituted of the players themselves. Djokovic is not one of the named players in the suit, though the 585th-best WTA player and 1,099th-best ATP player in the world are.</span>

                              <span>Maybe you forgot about the Los Angeles Clippers. It&#x27;s cool. It happens to me all the time. I think I did not remember them even once between Christmas and, uh, Sunday. If you&#x27;d asked me Tuesday afternoon to place the Clippers in the Western Conference standings without looking, I would&#x27;ve said, &quot;Anywhere between third and ninth,&quot; and you would&#x27;ve asked me to be more specific, and I would&#x27;ve said, &quot;Hmm, probably somewhere between fourth and eighth, but also maybe tenth.&quot; The West is like this, yes, but my brain has been conditioned over decades to mark all active knowledge of the Clippers as a waste product and to scrub it from short-term memory. It&#x27;s not even that I expect them to be bad. I expect them just not to matter very much.
With Tuesday&#x27;s performance, the Clippers made a compelling case for closer attention. They fell behind early at home to the buzzsaw Cleveland Cavaliers, scrambled back, and then spent the second half beating the hell out of one of the NBA&#x27;s very best teams. The extremely convincing win puts the Clippers a season-best nine games over .500, and keeps them within a game of the rising Golden State Warriors, who currently occupy the conference&#x27;s sixth seed, clear of the play-in. Lots can happen between now and the end of the regular season. The top eight teams in the West are really good. The seven teams below Oklahoma City in the standings are separated by just five games; a proud homestand here, a swoon there, and anyone in there might conceivably snatch the second seed. Ask the Rockets, who held the second seed for 29 straight days then plummeted to fifth, and now find themselves back in second. Or the Grizzlies, who rose to second in February and were there as recently as last week, and woke up this morning in fifth, with the Warriors, Clippers, and seventh-place Minnesota Timberwolves all fogging up their sideview mirrors. It&#x27;ll be a desperate sprint from here.</span>

                              <span>I’m watching The Gorge, a made-for-Apple movie that isn’t very good but will do the job on a lazy weekend morning. The story here is that there’s a gorge. It’s a very deep gorge, and its contents are so potentially dangerous that all of the world’s superpowers have deemed it necessary to entrust 24-hour surveillance of the gorge to … two people. Who are stationed on opposite sides of the gorge. One of those guards is professional idiot Miles Teller. The other is living Vermeer painting Anya Taylor-Joy. These two highly trained super soldiers aren’t allowed contact with one another from their respective watch tower positions. That would compromise the security of the gorge, and we can’t have that. We must protect this gorge.
However, thanks to tactical binoculars and a truly fantastical ability to write legible signs, our gorge-crossed lovers meet-cute at a distance and, in keeping with the spirit of tired romantic comedy, even manage to dance to the Ramones together before they both fall into the gorge. Once stuck down there, they must spend the rest of the movie killing knockoff Last of Us zombies while trapped in a knockoff Upside Down from Stranger Things. As I’ve told you, this isn’t a very good movie. And yet I have to stick with it from the opening scene, and do you know why? Because of the gun.</span>

                              <span>On Saturday, U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg tried and failed to block an agreement between the Trump administration and El Salvador that would pay the Central American country $6 million to imprison hundreds of people who were living in America. To make the deal happen, the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, used most notoriously to justify the mass internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. The act, in theory, can only be deployed in the context of war, but the Trump administration is using it as a weapon for a peacetime immigration clampdown. By claiming that Venezuelan &quot;gang members&quot; are invading the U.S., the Trump administration is attempting to bypass standard legal protections to quickly deport any immigrant whom they decide to say is associated with a gang.
Boasberg&#x27;s ruling came after the ACLU sued on behalf of five people facing imminent threat of deportation. Already, however, the administration was sending hundreds of people on a pair of flights to Central America. While Boasberg verbally ordered the planes to be turned around so those on them could have a chance to be heard in court, the Trump administration refused, and instead took the opportunity to gloat about defying the order.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve always liked Quentin Grimes. He&#x27;s athletic and smart, and when he broke out as the fifth starter for the cool-as-hell 2022–23 Knicks, he did so by defending the point of attack with ragged intensity and taking advantage of the opportunities created for him by Jalen Brunson and Julius Randle. Like a plant thriving in low-light conditions, he was a master of fitting into the Knicks&#x27; scheme without ever disrupting things.
The bummer of Grimes&#x27;s career is that his modularity and scant caloric demands, the very traits that made him fit in so well with New York, also made him fit in everywhere else. He has played for four teams in his four professional seasons: The Clippers traded him for Keon Johnson on draft night, the Knicks traded him to for Bojan Bogdanovic at the deadline last year, the Pistons traded him for Tim Hardaway Jr. last offseason, and the Mavericks just traded him to Philadelphia for Caleb Martin a few weeks ago. Grimes is a restricted free agent after this season, so it&#x27;s easy to imagine him wearing his fifth NBA uniform next fall. Every step of the way, Grimes has played the same role, starting about one third of the time and playing about 25 minutes per game, because every previous team he&#x27;s been on had either a Luka Doncic knockoff or the man himself to run things.</span>

                              <span>In 2006, by the time the scientist Sarah Cooley finished graduate school in marine science, oyster larvae in the Pacific Northwest had already begun dying mysteriously and dramatically—unable to form shells. By 2008, the largest oyster hatchery on the West Coast suffered losses of 80 percent. Hatcheries spent thousands of dollars stamping out any possible pathogens. But scientists eventually realized the killer was not bacterial, but chemical. The seawater had become acidic, the result of the ocean absorbing some of the surplus of carbon dioxide in the air. In 2010, researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, determined this corrosive water was killing the baby oysters.
The pH of the ocean is generally stable. But when carbon dioxide dissolves in water, a series of chemical reactions occur to create carbonic acid, lowering the pH of seawater and altering the chemistry of the ocean. In the past two centuries, the ocean has become 30 percent more acidic, a shift that has happened faster than any known change in ocean chemistry in the last 50 million years. This process, called ocean acidification, has profound effects for the many lives, human and non-human, that depend upon the ocean—dissolving the homes of shelled animals like oysters and the skeletons of coral, as well as destabilizing food webs and ecosystems.</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;re close to the end of our 12-week journey with The Artist&#x27;s Way and it&#x27;s prompting reflection among the more sentimental of us. What have we gained from this wacky, woo-woo experiment in nurturing our inner artist? Maybe it was a journaling habit. Maybe it&#x27;s a greater sensitivity to the coincidences that pop up in our everyday lives. Maybe it&#x27;s a deep resentment toward Julia Cameron and a confirmation of our disdain for the self-help genre. As we round out the last two weeks of this project, a few of us are re-committing to the process in the hopes of ending strong, and others are counting down the days. If you&#x27;ve been following along with us, congratulations on making it this far. Which camp have you landed in?

                              <span>Having the regular season start before Opening Day is a prospect as indulgent as it is unreal—once you&#x27;re up early to watch the Los Angeles Dodgers play the Chicago Cubs at 6 a.m. ET, you may as well buy in, even if the game had a nasty spring training hangover. No pitcher was fully stretched out. The Hanshin Tigers shut out the Dodgers and Cubs in back-to-back exhibition games just two days ago; Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman were out with ailment and injury for this morning&#x27;s lower bracket match-up. There wasn&#x27;t much, as far as glimpses into how each team would look throughout the rest of the regular season go.
This is not a complaint. The only thing better than one Opening Day is two, and the soft power exchange of MLB with Pokémon meant that no fewer than six Pikachus dressed in baseball jerseys were placidly bobbling about the diamond for the teams&#x27; on-field introductions. Novelty value aside, Joe Davis gave a brief history of Japanese baseball as cultural exchange; Japanese baseball legend Sadaharu Oh was present for the game. If it didn&#x27;t quite feel like regular season baseball, well—that was hardly the most important part. Last year&#x27;s Seoul Series, for all its splendor, was overshadowed by the news of Ippei Mizuhara&#x27;s gambling scandal. This year, there was just baseball and Cool Japan, and the fans in the stadium got a little bit of everything.</span>

Washington started its quest to return to the title game with a victory. And the Orlando Pride raised its championship banners, followed by a decisive 6-0 win over the Chicago Stars. After the match, Pride midfielder Haley McCutcheon talked about the club’s plans for defending its title: &quot;We don’t like to talk about outside noise, but there’s been a lot of talk about &#x27;Who&#x27;s gonna win the shield? Who&#x27;s gonna win the championship?&#x27; and we’ve not really been in the conversation, which is hilarious to us.&quot; 
The season openers also followed an offseason that saw the league bouncing from one report of abuse to another. The latest is this: the San Francisco Chronicle reported earlier this month that two formal complaints have been filed against Bay FC head coach Albertin Montoya, who&#x27;s been with the club for about a year and a half. Players called his coaching methods &quot;toxic&quot; and said team management knew about their concerns. One complaint was cleared by a third-party investigation initiated by the team. The second complaint was made through the league’s anonymous tip line but, per the Chronicle, its status remains unknown. From that same report:</span>

                              <span>After defeating Clara Tauson in February to win the first Masters 1000 title of the season, 17-year-old phenom Mirra Andreeva became a top-10 player for the first time in her young career. She joked in her on-court interview that doing so meant she&#x27;d already accomplished her primary goal for the season. In the moment, that felt like a sensible benchmark, impressively achieved. Three weeks later, having completed a stunning run through the best players in the world to win in Indian Wells, Andreeva looks to have been selling herself short.
Andreeva&#x27;s run to her second title of the year was phenomenal. She dropped six total games against Tauson and Elena Rybakina over the third and fourth rounds, and dispatched the red-hot Elina Svitolina to set up a foreboding summit push: a semifinal against Iga Swiatek and a potential final against Aryna Sabalenka. Neither had dropped a set until facing Andreeva. Ripping through the rest of the WTA elite is one thing, but the world&#x27;s best two players stand head and shoulders above the field, especially with Coco Gauff still struggling with her serve. Swiatek and Sabalenka each present distinct problems for opponents to solve, and each is capable of bullying opponents off the court with relative ease. Last year&#x27;s U.S. Open final made clear how wide the gap between one and four is.</span>

                              <span>It wouldn&#x27;t be a Playboi Carti album rollout if you didn&#x27;t have to sweat for it. Music, which comes five years after Whole Lotta Red, and which we thought we would get sometime last year, finally arrived Friday morning, though even that included a multiple-hour delay from its original 12 a.m. Pacific time slot. With its daunting 30-song track list, you can see that Carti tried to make up for the wait.
Music (or I Am Music, if you prefer) is a hard album to review because of how little it resembles an album in any classic sense, and I&#x27;m not just referring to the DJ Swamp Izzo tags throughout the project. It&#x27;s more reminiscent of mixtapes by Gucci Mane, Waka Flocka Flame, or, more specifically, Lil Wayne&#x27;s Drought and Dedication series. It&#x27;s a collection of 30 songs that don&#x27;t always jell together, and (sorry, old man here) aren&#x27;t exactly sequenced well. But no one would ever argue that Gucci&#x27;s Chicken Talk or Wilt Chamberlain tapes were cohesive, perfect projects, as mixtapes of that ilk tended to be a mixed bag. What made the classic ones classic was a combination of time and place, the good songs being especially good, and the creative freedom that comes from not being pressured to make some big artistic statement. Music maintains this spirit, flooding you with music and letting you make of it what you want. The highs are high enough to forgive the lows.</span>

Heading into the final round of this year’s Six Nations, Ireland needed a win over Italy and lots of help from above to get back to the top of the table and take an unprecedented third consecutive continental championship. The Irish did their part, creaking past Italy, 22-17, for a bonus-point win in Rome. The gods? Not so much. So there will be no three-peat. Tres bien, France.</span>

                              <span>Since the beginning of the 2017 season, Joey Gallo&#x27;s first full-time season in the major leagues, he and Juan Soto have hit exactly the same number of home runs. I think we all know where the story goes from here.
Well, mostly we know. Gallo is in some ways the prototypical no-average/high-power lug of his era, and for a while was a player who could convince teams to take the 40-homer seasons and defensive benefits (he’s a two-time Gold Glover) alongside the 200 strikeouts and sub-.200 averages that came with them. It might be that the more apt tense on that verb in fact is now &quot;was.&quot; Gallo put up a .161/.277/.336 slash line in 76 games with the Nationals last year, and was released by the talent-destitute Chicago White Sox last Friday after going 2-for-21 with 11 strikeouts in spring training.</span>

                              <span>Somewhere among the crudités, preserves, and edible flowers in With Love, Meghan, you may notice a tragedy: The Duchess of Sussex would have made an excellent working royal. Is this not their whole thing? Using the soft power of images to hide how little they have to say? Perfecting party tricks because they need no other skills? The eight-episode Netflix cooking show claims our lives can be “elevated” with just a tiny bit of plotting. (Serving a basket of croissants with strawberry preserves and a couple fresh strawberries, for example, can tell “a strawberry story.”) Meghan wraps gifts, works peonies into wild floral arrangements, speaks enough Argentinian Spanish to get by, and prints menus for brunch parties in her own chic calligraphy.
The whole thing is soothing and perfectly forgettable—except for these lines, which I plan to incorporate into my own story, to the confusion and alarm of my friends. (All are spoken by the Duchess herself, unless otherwise noted in parentheses.)</span>

                              <span>Chuck Schumer was always going to come out of the budget showdown a loser. The only question was which of the two available forms of losing he would end up with: an organized legislative surrender to Donald Trump and Elon Musk, which was the outcome he was trying to lead the Democrats toward, or a personal public rejection by his own party. 
In the end, the Senate minority leader got both. He scraped up eight more Senate Democrats to join him and John Fetterman in breaking his own party&#x27;s filibuster, allowing the continuing resolution written by the House Republicans to advance and sparing Donald Trump from presiding over a government shutdown. He pulled the deal together—allowing Democrats to offer amendments that would fail to pass, to show they&#x27;d tried—over the enraged objections of the united House minority, from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (&quot;To see Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk, I think is a huge slap in the face&quot;) to Nancy Pelosi (&quot;This false choice that some are buying instead of fighting is unacceptable&quot;).</span>

                              <span>Up until Saturday night, the athletic legacy of the University of California San Diego centered on its national championship-level surfing team. Yeah, surfing—it’s a sport, and you SEC-centric troglodytes will have to deal with it. You don&#x27;t like it? Go take it up with your fussy Airbnb host/god, Nick Saban.
And surfing is very much the sort of sport that a school like UCSD would be good at. UCSD is mostly known as a Public Ivy—long on brain, mostly indifferent to brawn. It tried football for one year a long time ago, went 0-7, and determined that high-speed human collisions weren&#x27;t for them, as smart folks might. The athletic department has done good work in other areas, but surfing is the calling card. If only there were raftloads of NIL money that came with it.</span>
