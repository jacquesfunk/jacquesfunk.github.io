                              <span>There is a lot of pressure on Canada and the United States to put on a sparkly, sparky show Thursday night in the 4 Nations Face-Off final. This has as much to do with nationalism as it does with the belief that hockey has figured out the all-star weekend conundrum that basketball has mangled, but you take it the way it hits you.
And let&#x27;s downplay the nationalism part. Thursday&#x27;s show almost has to begin with a line brawl during the Canadian national anthem, because that is precisely the bar the two teams set for themselves when they played on Saturday. Nothing sells these days quite like jingoism, the U.S. is back to treating Canada like the unnamed 14th colony, and well, there are going to be Tkachuks on the ice. The hockey could be brilliant on Thursday; it very well might be since most of the world&#x27;s best players this time around are Canadians or Americans. But Saturday also gave us three serious fights in the game&#x27;s first nine seconds, which got the attention of even hockey arrivistes.</span>

                              <span>It is a good and strange time to be a hockey fan. It&#x27;s a perfect storm: the 4 Nations Face-Off going far beyond expectations, the U.S. and Canada engaged in uncustomary and very stupid geopolitical beef, the NBA having existential conniptions over its disastrous all-star game. The numbers back up the anecdotal evidence that casual fans are paying attention to the tournament in a way they haven&#x27;t acknowledged hockey in years; I&#x27;ve been hearing from non-fan friends about that bellicose USA-Canada game this weekend. With this wider attention inevitably comes getting caught up in the culture wars. Pick your poison—hockey can be used to support any pet take, no matter how deluded or xenophobic. It&#x27;s enough to invert the classic plea: Please don&#x27;t like my sport. 
But that&#x27;s the price of popularity. And if Thursday night&#x27;s U.S. vs. Canada winner-take-all final of the first best-on-best tournament in a decade attracts some of the &quot;wrong&quot; type of audience members, that&#x27;s not my problem, or yours. We get to enjoy two incredible hockey teams who genuinely dislike each other settling things on the ice. Nothing but pride and bragging rights will actually be on the line, and that&#x27;s more than enough.</span>

                              <span>The most puzzling part of the Jannik Sinner&#x27;s doping saga might be its conclusion. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) announced over the weekend that it had reached a settlement with the top-ranked player in men&#x27;s tennis. WADA would no longer be moving forward with its appeal of a previous &quot;no fault or negligence&quot; ruling reached by a tennis-specific anti-doping authority, which, had it been successful, could have carried a ban of one to two years. Instead, WADA and Sinner agreed to a settlement: He would accept a three-month suspension, starting Feb. 9 to May 4, a span in which he would miss no major tournaments on the tour.
There has been a lot of conspiratorial chatter about this case, much of it from fellow players, much of it wildly ill-informed (with one exception). I had my own narrower misgivings. Sinner&#x27;s story involved a somewhat convoluted series of mishaps: His trainer supplied a physiotherapist with an over-the-counter topical clostebol spray for a finger cut, then said spray got into Sinner&#x27;s body when the physio massaged the player&#x27;s sore-covered dermatitic skin. That was meant to explain how metabolites of clostebol were detected in two samples collected from Sinner eight days apart last March. But how could experienced staffers whose critical job function was to keep prohibited substances out of their employer&#x27;s body do something this careless? Why would clostebol spray ever be in the vicinity of a work trip? Why were those staffers retained for months after this catastrophic error?</span>

                              <span>The Toronto Sceptres learned the hard way last year that it’s risky to lean too hard on one star, even when the star&#x27;s up to the task. When Natalie Spooner tore her ACL in the third game of the semifinal round of the PWHL playoffs in May, the Sceptres lost a league-leading goalscorer and pretty much their entire offense, too. Toronto scored just one goal in the final three games of that series. The injury cut short their inaugural season, and complicated their next one: The Sceptres would have to replace an MVP’s production for as long as it took Spooner to get back. Could they make it work?
No, the first few games suggested. Behind a shaky defense, Kristen Campbell, the league’s top goalie last year, struggled to start the season. The team clearly missed Spooner’s net-front presence and the high-percentage shots she generated with her size and quick hands. But things took an encouraging turn in late January, when the last-place Sceptres began to lose in shootouts instead of in regulation. Suddenly, they were putting together a point streak. Soon, the point streak became a win streak. With a 3-2 overtime win against Ottawa on Sunday, Toronto’s fourth straight, the Sceptres moved into second place in the PWHL standings, only behind juggernaut Montreal.</span>

                              <span>Manchester United is not any good. There&#x27;s no reason to think they will or even theoretically could turn things around before the season is out. It will probably take yet another major offseason overhaul for United to even start to address its problems. None of this is breaking news, but what is legitimately stunning is how the Red Devils keep contriving to make a bad situation—one entirely of the club&#x27;s own making—even worse.
On Sunday, Manchester United traveled to North London to face Tottenham, another so-called Big Six team that is in moderate-to-severe crisis. Aside from their positions on the table—much lower than either expected—there are not many similarities between Tottenham and United. The former is an injury-ridden mess that beats itself more often than not, while the latter is by almost every metric a middling team that plays even worse than that due to something unquantifiable: a rancid air of stagnation that has seeped into every pore of the once-vaunted club.</span>

                              <span>The Athletic&#x27;s profile of Dallas Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison will change no minds re: his role in the exile of Luka Doncic, but at least we saw this side of him: He seems like the kind of person you would do anything to avoid talking to at a party. Or maybe you find this paragraph a sign of a good friend:
Harrison is a notorious nutrition devotee and will occasionally begin conversations by quizzing friends on their health habits. &quot;What did you eat today?&quot; is one of his go-to greetings.</span>

                              <span>HBO had a series of legendary stand-up specials in the 1990s, and one of the best of those came from a performer who was not a comedian. Ricky Jay and His 52 Assistants was incredibly funny, but Jay was a magician, although that seems not quite right. The press material for the special, which first aired on December 17, 1996, called him an “illusionist.” That feels closer, but still not quite sufficient. The special, which was directed by Jay’s regular collaborator David Mamet, combined a number of astonishing card tricks with a breezily thorough recounting of the history of magic. That was more or less Ricky Jay&#x27;s act; no one else has ever really done anything like it.
Ricky Jay, who died in 2018 at the age of 72, combined mastery of his craft with a thorough knowledge of its culture and lore. His 52 Assistants special was notable for his ability to throw playing cards into a watermelon and also his skill at explaining the long history of the cups and balls trick. You probably don’t need to be told not to get tricked into playing that by a hustler on the subway; Jay walks his audience through the long history of that hustle.</span>

                              <span>I thought I was being smart when I turned the NBA All-Star Game on 30 minutes late. NBA tip-off times are notoriously far afield of what is promised by TV listings, and I wasn&#x27;t eager to spend any more time than was absolutely necessary watching pregame ceremonies, or listening to Kevin Hart talk. 8:30 ET seemed like a good time to tune in, even if it meant I might end up missing the first few minutes of the first game. When the TV flicked on, that game hadn&#x27;t started yet, and Kevin Hart was screaming at me.
This was supposed to be the All-Star Game that got things back on track, whatever that means. Commissioner Adam Silver, who never misses an opportunity to bemoan the lack of effort and attention given to the All-Star Game by the players, unveiled a new format that was meant to force a little competitive spirit into the game. Instead of one normal game—between East and West, or Americans and internationals, or Team LeBron and Team Ghost Of Kobe Bryant—we were treated to three mini-games that would make up a tournament. Three separate teams of all-stars, selected by Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Candace Parker, and Kenny Smith, were thrown into a bracket with the Rising Stars team. The winners of the two semifinal games, played to 40 points, advanced to the final, also played to 40 points.</span>

                              <span>I started reading Bill Gates’s new memoir Source Code the day after David Lynch died. In between learning about his pioneering BASIC coding language, I struggled to grasp what Laura Dern was saying in Inland Empire. In many respects, the two couldn’t be more different, but in some ways they act as mirrors—two lives that could have reversed with just a few small tweaks. Both were strongly identified with the West Coast: Gates in Seattle, Lynch in foresty Washington and then Los Angeles. Both held singular visions in their respective fields. One man pursued his passion with antisocial intensity, the other became the subject of clip compilations like “David Lynch melting my heart for three minutes straight.” One has spread software we use day in and day out, the other masterminded some of the most beguiling cinema ever produced. And now, Gates, one of the world’s richest men, has delivered one of its most pointless memoirs.
Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, served as the company’s CEO and largest shareholder until 2014. He founded the philanthropic Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation with his now ex-wife, and his net worth hovers in the hundreds of billions. Along the way, he’s been accused of bullying, anti-competitive business tactics, and even spending too much time with noted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. When the tech tycoon came out swinging for vaccine patents in 2021, The New Republic called him a “monster.” But as he continues to fight climate change and Covid misinformation, a memoir offers a perfect opportunity to try to boost his spiraling reputation by reflecting on his earlier, more innocent childhood idylls.</span>

                              <span>When I lived in Beijing, our apartment had two front doors on it. There was a regular, sturdy wooden apartment door, and outside that was a thick steel door, with heavy deadbolts mounted not only on the side but at the bottom. Up and down our entryway were various other steel apartment doors, apparently add-ons by the owners, in different styles and finishes. 
This apartment was a sublet in middle-class worker housing, in a compound with a guardhouse at the entrance, in a neighborhood that included embassies, a fancy patisserie, an upscale Japanese mall, and a Pizza Hut. Now and then there might be a drunken scuffle in the alley outside, but the interior courtyard was never troubled by anything worse than grimy stray cats. Daily life was peaceful and secure. Yet there were those steel doors, subtle monuments to the proposition that things could—someday, quickly—be very different.</span>

                              <span>Last month the Baltimore Banner reported on allegations against Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, made by six women who had worked as massage therapists in the Baltimore area between 2012 and 2016. They each described having similar experiences while massaging Tucker, which included Tucker moving the sheet during the session to expose his erect penis, brushing his penis against their bodies, and leaving what appeared to be ejaculate on the massage table. The Banner has since published two follow-up reports in which more massage therapists say they experienced similar misconduct while massaging Tucker, bringing the total number of women to have come forward to 16.
The latest report, published Sunday, concerns allegations made by seven massage therapists. These women say they also had sessions with Tucker between 2012 and 2016 at various spas around the Baltimore area. Each of them described versions of the same experience: Tucker&#x27;s erect penis was visible under the sheet when the session started, and he repeatedly attempted to remove the sheet. One woman said Tucker brushed her thighs with his fingers during the session, and another said he left what appeared to be ejaculate on the massage table when he left, which is something that several women in the Banner&#x27;s first story reported seeing.</span>

                              <span>The Mission Impossible franchise is famous for its mask reveals. A dubiously explained technology allows an innocuous silver briefcase to print out a gummy-like mask that, once plastered to a face, transforms Tom Cruise into the spitting image of Philip Seymour Hoffman or various others, enabling him to infiltrate various lairs and turrets. The masks in Mission Impossible make for a fun game as a viewer: Is the bad guy you&#x27;re watching really a bad guy, or is he actually Ethan Hunt?
If Mission Impossible ever took place in a colony of harvester termites in the mountains of Morocco, Ethan Hunt might be, for once, out of a job. A new paper in Current Biology describes how the larvae of a blow fly has evolved to live, apparently unnoticed, inside the nests of harvester termites. Its main strategy, it seems, is the &quot;termite mask&quot; that protrudes from its rump. This mask features two antennae, a pair of sensory palps, and two large red &quot;eyes&quot; that are actually breathing holes. (Yes, the termite breathes from its butt; so what!)</span>

                              <span>According to the the 2024 National League Most Valuable Player award, Shohei Ohtani was the most valuable player in the National League in 2024. He achieved this status on a new team, his World Series-winning Dodgers, as a mere designated hitter who nevertheless put up a 9.2 bWAR through 54 home runs, 59 stolen bases, a .390 OBP and a 1.036 OPS. He&#x27;s one of the most amazing position players any of us have ever seen, but get this: He pitches, too!
That&#x27;s right. It was easy to ignore with all that he gave the Dodgers last season, but LA was only receiving half of the Ohtani package in 2024. Due to an elbow injury, Ohtani hasn&#x27;t taken the mound for an MLB game in nearly 18 months, but from 2021 to 2023 he was an ace-caliber hurler for the Angels, peaking in that middle campaign with a 1.012 WHIP and a 172 ERA+ off an AL-leading 11.9 strikeouts per nine.

                              <span>Across much of the animal kingdom, the meanings behind some creatures&#x27; gestures are reserved only for other members of their species. A person watching a honeybee&#x27;s waggle dance would not understand the information about a pollen-rich flower patch or nearby watering hole that the bee is communicating through its dance. Anyone lucky enough to witness the busty dance of the sage grouse will certainly be impressed—but of what, exactly, they may not be so sure. And yet I recently learned of a behavior in turtles called &quot;turtle dance&quot; whose meaning was immediately obvious to me, a non-turtle.

                              <span>Connor McDavid scored the opening goal of Team Canada&#x27;s hotly anticipated 4 Nations game in Montreal on Saturday night, but it wasn&#x27;t enough for a home-team victory. The Canadians would go on to surrender two in response on frustrating mistakes, then find themselves locked up by conservative defense as an empty netter made the final score 3-1. Nevertheless, a date with Finland to end the round-robin stage on Monday afternoon still gives them hope, as a win would likely propel them into a Thursday night final weighted with the possibility of revenge.
Not a lot of hockey games start like this one did, as the rowdy Tkachuk boys and the rowdy canuck boys announced the intensity of their competitiveness from the moment the puck dropped. Brandon Hagel had a ferocious fight with Matthew Tkachuk just two seconds in, and after the officials pulled the two off the ice and put them in the penalty box, Brady Tkachuk and Canada&#x27;s Sam Bennett sabotaged the attempt to restore order. Officially three seconds into the game, the refs cleared out so the two could consensually hit each other until Brady executed a tackle on Bennett. A tiny bit of hockey happened after those penalty minutes appeared on the box score. But when Canada goalie Jordan Binnington froze the puck with 19:51 on the clock, it was JT Miller and St. Albert&#x27;s own Colton Parayko whose tempers boiled over, with Parayko using his size to hold off Miller&#x27;s assault until the two were exhausted.</span>

                              <span>JuJu Watkins was everything and the only thing. On Thursday night against No. 1 UCLA, she was the beginning, hitting three threes in the first quarter to send that awful she’s got it tonight feeling through the Bruins’ stomachs. She was the middle, literally all of it. When the sophomore guard found teammate Kennedy Smith alone at the rim in transition to start the fourth quarter, Smith’s layup was USC’s first non-Watkins field goal since the end of the first. And then she was the end. In the fourth quarter, the No. 6 Trojans trailing and gasping for breath, she blocked three shots in the span of a minute and scored two quick baskets to regain the lead her team had lost early in the third.
Not until the two-minute mark of the fourth quarter did any of her teammates finally break double digits. But by that point, there was no mystery left. JuJu Watkins had spoiled the plot: No matter how many times UCLA took control, no matter how many layups her teammates fumbled, no matter how sludgy the offense got, she would not be losing tonight. End of story.</span>

                              <span>The Philadelphia Eagles’ Super Bowl parade ends at the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In a few months, that museum will receive its own prize from the Eagles’ win—an Édouard Manet painting, won on loan from Kansas City’s Nelson-Atkins Museum in a Super Bowl bet.
This is the second time the museums have wagered on the Super Bowl; two years ago in April KC’s museum got Thomas Eakins’s 1875 oil painting Sailing from the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It was on display for about two months. While it would be Very Philadelphian to have settled this bet using a Philadelphia artist, the Nelson-Atkins curators were the ones to pick that painting from the PMA’s collection.</span>

                              <span>Although an American politician will have plenty of occasions to denounce racism, it&#x27;s rare that said politician would be put in a position to denounce racism toward Indians, specifically. Rarer still is the scenario in which such a politician has an Indian wife and kids himself.
Vice President JD Vance found himself in those narrow circumstances earlier this month. Marko Elez, a 25-year-old enlistee at Elon Musk&#x27;s center for bussin&#x27; constitutional violations, had been linked to a Twitter account that posted things like &quot;Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,&quot; and &quot;Normalize Indian hate.&quot; Straightforwardly vile stuff, although I must note that if Elez really did attend Rutgers and major in computer science, he wasn&#x27;t trying all that hard to avoid us.</span>

This may have something to do with why a post about comments we liked from 2024 is being published in February 2025.
Things generally feel real bad right now, and that has a way of permeating just about everything. It can make posting a comment on the internet seem even more pointless than normal (which should be impossible), and it can make compiling a list of comments from one website (even our favorite website) seem like a gigantic waste of time.  But you know what, we got into looking through comments, and I found myself forgetting these feelings and laughing instead.</span>

                              <span>Donald Trump’s last-minute decision to release water into Tulare County reservoirs as a belated solution to the fires in Southern California didn’t make much sense to anyone. The water wouldn’t actually make it to Los Angeles, and the places in the San Joaquin Valley where it was going are more at risk of flooding right now than of drying out. Even the supposed beneficiaries of the water windfall knew that gorging now meant potentially being dry during the long hot summers when they actually needed the water. 
“A decision to take summer water from local farmers and dump it out of these reservoirs shows a complete lack of understanding of how the system works and sets a very dangerous precedent,” Dan Vink, a longtime Tulare County water manager told SJV Water.</span>

Or healthcare, press freedom, income equality, environmental protection, political transparency, child and maternal mortality, or life expectancy. But no one can say we don&#x27;t have one hell of a hockey team. USA! USA! USA!
Just how good this Team USA is, heralded as perhaps the best roster the country has ever iced, is still to be determined, even after a 6-1 shellacking of Finland in Montreal on Thursday night that served as both a barometer and a warm-up for Saturday&#x27;s throwdown with Team Canada. Business was taken care of against the overmatched Finns, even if it took a little while to transact. &quot;We either win or we learn,&quot; said Finland captain Aleksander Barkov. &quot;We learned a lot.&quot;</span>
