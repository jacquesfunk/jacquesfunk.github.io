                              <span>In the mid-to-late &#x27;90s, I was part of a girl gang that invaded suburban homes across the top half of New Jersey. We left our clothes strewn across various surfaces in your carpeted basements, ate your Snackwells in the wee hours, and wrote weird notes to your awkward eldest sons. Some of us stayed up all night, laughing and plotting, and some of us, inexplicably, wanted to go to bed at 9:00 p.m. For days afterwards, you would catch the faint smell of Bath &amp; Body Works warm vanilla sugar.
It was the age of the pre-teen slumber party, and you could hear us coming from the synth riff of Kim Wilde’s “Kids in America.” It’s the song that opens Clueless, which was the preferred VHS rental for the coolest sleepovers I attended. We were the kids of America, even if we were closer to Nickelodeon’s definition than MTV’s, and Clueless offered a hopeful glimpse into life beyond middle school. We all wanted to be Cher Horowitz—beautiful, popular, rich, and, yes, even kind—and we weren’t the only ones.</span>

                              <span>Terry Bollea died on Thursday. The former professional wrestler was 71 years old. According to his longtime manager, Bollea died at his home in Clearwater, Fla.; different reports say that paramedics responded at dawn to an emergency call reporting that Bollea was suffering from cardiac arrest. He&#x27;d had some sort of recent neck surgery, and was rumored to be in failing health. Bollea&#x27;s wife, Sky, recently batted away rumors that he was in a coma. Fellow washed-up wrestling luminary Jimmy Hart insisted Tuesday afternoon that Bollea was &quot;doing phenomenal.&quot; That turned out to be not the case.
Reports of Bollea&#x27;s poor health were first circulated by the radio personality Bubba the Love Sponge Clem. Followers of Bollea&#x27;s post-wrestling career will recall that Clem and Bollea were once good friends and sometimes appeared together on Clem&#x27;s Tampa-area radio show. In 2012, the two made headlines when Gawker reported that Clem had recorded a clandestine video of his wife, Heather, having sex with Bollea. A separate recording that became public years later captured Bollea making vile and racist remarks while in conversation with Heather.</span>

You still have to walk around, naturally, there&#x27;s stuff that needs doing and nothing is really gained by sitting around thinking about how stupid and crooked and venal everything is, and about the confluence of cultural forces conspiring to make it all dumber and nastier and worse, or about the erosion of the institutions and mores that ideally would stem that degradation. And yet, if you&#x27;re the someone who thinks about that sort of thing—and if you are aware of it, it does tend to clatter around in your brain even if just as highly intrusive background noise—you can&#x27;t just not think about it.

                              <span>COURCHEVEL, France — Lunch: indisputably one of the top-three meals of the day, but at the Tour de France, not always something the intrepid reporter can afford to prioritize. Most days involve some degree of frantic scurrying between the start and finish, hitting the road early to go stand around the team buses and ask as many people as possible, &quot;What&#x27;s going to happen today?&quot; (this often works, somehow) before scrambling to beat the peloton to the finish and ask them what happened today. Breakfast is typically one pastry, eaten in the car, and dinner is something to be taken seriously here in France, so it is good. In between, there is not much time.
However! The Amaury Sport Organization (ASO), the Tour&#x27;s organizing body, provides a press room for journalists to in theory write and in practice annoy each other in like seven different languages, and the press room usually has food. I am not in the press room every day, especially on mountainous days, because it is quite often far from the finish line, which is where the interesting stuff happens. Those days, I eat either the world&#x27;s driest sandwich from a French gas station or the world&#x27;s least flavorful salad from a French gas station. Other days, I eat in the press room.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s exceedingly rare to see a side enter an international tournament and manage to play its best, most aesthetically pleasing soccer for the entire month-long affair. It does happen—the Spanish men absolutely steamrolled Euro 2012, and the USWNT did the same at the 2019 World Cup—but more often than not, exhaustion, nerves, and tough matchups will force a team to win ugly on the way to the trophy. In Wednesday&#x27;s Euro 2025 semifinal against Germany, Spain won ugly, as ugly as I&#x27;ve seen during the team&#x27;s ongoing run of dominance, though La Roja did manage to sneak some real transcendence into a long and draining night in Zurich.

It can be nice to have a solid brand. For example, I always order the same drinks at the bar, so if I am running late, and I ask someone to order for me, I always get what I want, because I always want the same thing. But because I am consistent, people sometimes freak out when I choose something else. A week or so ago, I ordered a different drink at the bar, and everyone acted like I had two heads! The expectations people have of what I like, then, are determining the kinds of recommendations and information people give to me. No one told me the fancy little whiskey cocktail was so good, because no one thought I would want it!</span>

Back in February, McAfee used his show to amplify a rumor about Ole Miss student Mary Kate Cornett having an affair with her boyfriend&#x27;s dad. The rumor had already gone viral on social media, with Cornett&#x27;s name attached, and McAfee&#x27;s decision to discuss it on air—during an interview with NFL insider Adam Schefter, of all people—made things much worse for her. Cornett&#x27;s phone number was posted online, her mother&#x27;s house was swatted, and she received so many threats that she had to switch to online courses and move into emergency housing.</span>

A little over three months later, on July 23, I am happy to inform you that the Rich Hill is BACK countdown has officially ended, because Rich Hill is BACK, and this time with the Kansas City Royals!
Since signing his Minor League deal, the 45-year-old Hill has put up a 5.22 ERA over 11 starts in the minors. Two of those starts came at the Rookie ball level—where, according to Baseball-Reference, he is 23.9 years older than the weighted average age of players in Rookie ball—while the remaining nine came in Triple-A, where he is a mere 17.5 years older than the average. While the ERA is less than ideal, Hill averaged a little less than six strikeouts per start.</span>

                              <span>GENEVA — If it weren’t for the crystal-blue lake and rugged mountains that sandwich the city, I’d have thought I was in London. In the 36 hours before England’s Women’s Euro semifinal match against Italy, downtown Geneva was crawling with English accents and white kits with leonine crests. The only thing more prevalent than England fans was the ample signage around the city promoting the tournament.
As I walked around, I began to wonder if, come match time, the stadium would be a sea of white, with nary an Italian fan in sight. I kept an eagle eye out for blue Italy jerseys, and found only enough to count on one hand. In fact, I spotted more German and Spanish kits than those for the Azzurre, and that semifinal is across the country. Even on game day, as I merged into the mass of fans streaming into the stadium, only specks of blue shone through the white.</span>

                              <span>Tuesday night brought another rough loss for the Los Angeles Dodgers—one of a whopping 43 they&#x27;ve already suffered so far this year. Facing the Minnesota Twins at home, the defending champions got absolutely blown out of the ballpark in a three-run loss. Surely no team has ever faced adversity like this.
On Teoscar Hernández&#x27;s bobblehead night (he was benched), the score was even at 3-3 through five, with starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto getting tagged for a couple of unearned runs in a tricky second inning. Once he exited, however, L.A. completely lost the plot. Ben Casparius, the first reliever out of the pen, looked hurt as he failed to get any of his four batters out, and he&#x27;ll get an MRI. Alexis Díaz was unable to strand two of the runners he inherited. And after Will Klein walked three straight in the seventh, Edgardo Henriquez entered the game and generously turned a Royce Lewis check-swing chopper into a three-bagger with a wild throw into the right-field corner.</span>

                              <span>As the NFL&#x27;s loudest, goofiest, and by far richest general manager, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is always positioned for the camera, any camera. His singular and long-running M.O.—the tough-talking soft touch in contract negotiations—has always been a comedic staple. It allows him to be a hawk and a kitten on player deals simultaneously.
As a result, his circumnavigations regarding super-de-duperstar defensive end Micah Parsons are made more interesting by the way that Jones gave in most recently, which was on Dak Prescott&#x27;s $240 million deal, which guaranteed $231 million in salary, a year ago. On the one hand, Parsons not yet having a contract is not yet officially a pressing matter; Dallas&#x27; first loss of the season, at Philadelphia in the first game of the season, is still six weeks away. On the other, Jones sounds like he is taking the NFL&#x27;s not-so-secret aggression against guaranteed money to spleen, if not necessarily to heart.</span>

                              <span>No record ever spoke to me more than Southern Rock Opera by the Drive-By Truckers. It’s a concept album released in 2001 that has lots of songs about growing up in the South in the late &#x27;70s and not having much going on besides power drinking and rock and roll. That record could be my life. And of all the period-piece vignettes, none hit me where I live more than a verse in &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; where frontman Patterson Hood bragged about a concert the rock gods blessed upon him back in the day: “I sure saw Ozzy Osbourne,” Hood warbled, “with Randy Rhoads in ‘82 right before that plane crash.”
Well, me too: On February 24, 1982, I caught Ozzy’s Diary of a Madman tour when it stopped in Lubbock, Texas. Ozzy wielded an oversized crucifix while doddering around a stage that had been tarted up to look like a medieval castle. Headbangers heaven.</span>

                              <span>MONT VENTOUX, France — &quot;I had goosebumps in the moment, it was so incredible,&quot; Soudal-QuickStep team photographer Wout Beel said the morning of Stage 17. &quot;I am getting goosebumps again just talking about it, look!&quot; he said, showing me his arm. It&#x27;s true, he was. One day earlier, one of his team&#x27;s riders had won the stage—but not just any rider, and not just any stage. Finally, the French had gotten on the board.
With each dominant Tadej Pogacar win and each successive anonymous performances from the hometown teams, you could feel the anxiety building. Heading into a punishing third week of the Tour, a French rider had not won a stage at the 2025 Tour de France. Marc Madiot&#x27;s considerable eyebrows scrunched together with extra verve, the man who dresses as a king in the fan zone looked slightly less vainglorious, and the French press seemed somehow even more dour with each passing day. The French have only failed to win a stage three times, and a fruitless Tour on the 40th anniversary of the last time a French rider won the yellow jersey would have prompted a fresh round of French hysterics. That gnawing anxiety is partially what made Julian Alaphilippe&#x27;s premature celebration so painful, and partially what made Valentin Paret-Peintre&#x27;s victory on Mont Ventoux one stage later so cathartic.</span>

                              <span>What money are WNBA players owed? The league’s biggest names got people asking this question Saturday night, when they all wore “Pay Us What You Owe Us” warmup T-shirts before the All-Star Game in Indianapolis. Two days earlier, the players and the league met for their first in-person collective bargaining session, which players generally left feeling frustrated.
“Based on their most recent proposal, we just aren’t able to get to a place where we’re actually even talking about the same thing,” Breanna Stewart said the day after the meeting. The stakes are big. The labor deal will govern what WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert called the league’s “hypergrowth,” a moment of huge new valuations, a $2.2 billion media rights deal set to kick in next year, and a round of expansion that will seriously change the league’s scope. Negotiations for the last CBA lasted into the winter, but the current agreement technically expires at the end of October. Ahead of a big free-agency period in February and the upcoming Toronto and Portland expansion drafts, there&#x27;s some pressure to get this done before then.</span>

                              <span>The advent of the ghost runner made it possible to score a run in baseball without ever getting on base: In extra innings now, a bunt and a sac fly will do the trick. To truncate years-old discourse, this is a clear affront to the principles of baseball. What the Philadelphia Phillies did to the Boston Red Sox in the bottom of the 10th inning of Monday night&#x27;s game is more old-fashioned than that.
It has always been possible to score a run in baseball without ever hitting the ball into play, though it requires so many walks—or so many wild pitches—within an inning that its accomplishment could hardly be credited to the hitting team. To do it requires the full cooperation, intentional or not, of the opposing pitcher. It would be more accurate to place the bulk of the responsibility for what fans had to witness on Monday night not on the Phillies, who were attempting to commit one atrocity and instead committed another, or the ghost runner, though it lowered the difficulty by one walk, but on the Red Sox and relief pitcher Jordan Hicks.</span>

                              <span>VAISON-LA-ROMAINE, France — On the morning of Stage 15 of the Tour de France, I was strolling the paddock with a colleague when we happened upon the fan who&#x27;d had her cardboard signed turned into jersey fluff by Julian Alaphilippe on the top of the Tourmalet. Clara came from Barcelona to watch the Tour, cheer for her favorite rider, and cheekily propose holy matrimony to him via cardboard sign. &quot;I wanted him to read it quickly, because he is tired,&quot; she said. Did she think it would work? &quot;No, I don’t think so, but I have to try.&quot; Her first language is Spanish, she told me in English, and she wrote her sign in Dutch. Asked in French if she spoke Dutch, she said no, she had to work out the translation. 
Any given exchange at the Tour might involve this amount of translingualism. I have talked to Belgians in Spanish and Norwegians in English, and have tried and failed to talk to anyone in French, often resorting under duress to a dogmouthed combination of the three. Still, I have been surprised at how easy it&#x27;s been to get around with only English and Spanish. The Tour itself is conducted in French and English, though obviously French takes precedence. Official communiques are issued first in French, race radio is mostly in French, and the English translations have a charming clunkiness.</span>

                              <span>Craig Finn is the poet laureate of people who just can’t make it work. His songs are full of burnouts and failures, hard drinkers and rough sleepers, the lagging and the left behind. Their successes evaporate, and their mistakes linger. The narrator of “God in Chicago” has to move a baseball-sized package of heroin left behind by his dead friend Charlie. Every part of the deal—his unemployment, his busted car, the dealer who ruined his chance at college—reminds him of how poorly his life has gone. He makes the trip with Charlie’s sister, they sell the drugs, they get drunk and spend the night together. By the time they get home, she’s sobbing. There is no escape, no solution, no catharsis, and he knows it. “This isn’t the movies.”
This unsentimental compassion, with its humanistic care for those making wrong but necessary choices, is maybe my favorite thing about Finn’s music, but then there’s a lot to like. He’s been making music for more than 30 years with the bands Lifter Puller and the Hold Steady, and he’s been putting out a solo record every two or three years since 2012. Deploying a distinctly novelistic irony, he allows his listener to indulge alongside his characters, and then pulls back to survey the wreckage.</span>

                              <span>Some people are fans of the Tennessee Titans. But many, many more people are NOT fans of the Tennessee Titans. This 2025 Defector NFL team preview is for those in the latter group. Read all the previews so far here.
Your team: The Tennessee Titans, who are currently attempting to prevent the Houston Texans from using Houston Oilers blue. Jesus Christ Titans, just go back to being the Oilers already. The Houston Oilers’ signature accomplishment, blowing a 35-3 lead in a playoff game, is still a better legacy than anything the “Titans” have “accomplished” in their quarter century-plus as an ongoing NFL concern. The only time the outside world pays attention to these slobs is when Tennessee wears Oilers throwbacks, and you know why? Because it helps them forget that the Titans exist. I’d rather wear a dead skin mask than a Titans jersey.</span>

                              <span>Once upon a time, the world heavyweight champ was the most famous man on Earth. But other than hardcore fight fans, nobody can even pick Oleksandr Usyk out of a lineup. And he’s held the belt for nearly four years. But the spotlight could soon shine on the 38-year-old Ukrainian, who remained undefeated and retained his undisputed heavyweight title Saturday night in London with a beautifully brutal defeat of English challenger Daniel Dubois, 
Usyk to this point’s been seen as a fighter’s fighter, far more a technician than a bully. The boxing public prefers that artistry be left to little guys. Whoever wears the heavyweight belt has one job: to knock mofos out. Usyk moved from cruiserweight to heavyweight in 2019, and before this weekend had only knocked out one mofo since moving up. That came in August 2023 in Poland, when he stopped Dubois in a controversial bout tainted by a crucial referee’s decision in Usyk’s favor.</span>

Fortunately for every American who knows better than to ever get their hopes up regarding this kind of thing, he caught himself and swiftly tied that deed to something retrograde, smallminded, and cheap.
First, Old Squatty said he would interject himself into the potential Washington area football stadium, and do so in a way that was unkind to the owners of the local football factory. As with everything else Trump does or says, it was inevitable that there would be a catch, or just an angle for graft. But in the broadest strokes, it could almost have passed for some fiscal responsibility from the least responsible rich guy of them all.</span>

                              <span>MONTPELLIER, France — Fifteen stages and two rest days into the Tour de France, the talk of the press room is not Tadej Pogacar rampaging towards his fourth yellow jersey, brave Kevin Vauquelin trying for an unlikely top-five finish, or Jonas Vingegaard&#x27;s absurd time-trial helmet. The story that has everyone buzzing concerns events that happened 13 years ago. It is interesting in substance, though its form is the aspect that demands attention. What may seem at first blush like a straightforward story about someone breaking the rules in a different era of cycling is in fact a neat encapsulation of the fraught dynamics between power, media, and performance in cycling; the tension between cycling&#x27;s dirty past and its supposedly clean present; and the necessity of squaring the two eras.
The story begins in Feb. 2019, when Austrian cross-country skier Johannes Dürr blew the whistle on a German physician named Mark Schmidt, accusing the latter of running a systematic blood doping ring. Schmidt had previously worked for the scandal-plagued Milram and Gerolsteiner cycling teams; in 2009 Austrian cyclist Bernard Kohl had accused him of running doping practices for those teams, though he didn&#x27;t face any consequences until the Dürr revelations. The investigation came to be known as Operation Aderlass, German for &quot;bloodletting.&quot;</span>

                              <span>After Marcus Walden was called up by the Toronto Blue Jays in early 2014, nearly seven years after being drafted by the club, everything went more or less as you might expect for a big league promotion. For Father’s Day, Walden gifted his dad the first jersey he ever wore on a big league field; in his hometown of Fresno, Ca. his spot in history was solidified. “After 2014, when I came home, they put up a sign at my high school, number 67,” Walden told Defector. “And at my college they have a wall with every guy who made it to the big leagues out of Fresno [City College] and I was put up there.” This is how it is supposed to go, and the congratulations and honors that are supposed to be bestowed on a player whose dream is coming true. “It was great,” Walden said, “except the issue was I never played.”
In the history recognized by Major League Baseball through to the moment this story is published, 23,522 players have been called up to the highest level of play and participated in at least one game for their team. A little bit deeper in the annals of baseball history, unrecognized by Baseball-Reference, FanGraphs, or Major League Baseball itself are the hundreds of players who were called up to the majors, wore their team’s uniform, had their names written on the lineup card, brought their families to the stadium, and spent at least one full game as an active player on the roster. The one catch, in this case, is that these players were never put into a game before being sent back down to the minors. Because of this, their status as a major leaguer exists in an odd in-between, a limbo of conflicting emotions and almosts. These phantom ballplayers made it to the pinnacle of the sport, but not quite across the threshold.</span>

                              <span>The thing that the New York Yankees are doing is not sign-stealing. For one thing, it is entirely independent of the communications of their opponents, which raises it entirely above the board, according to both the rules and the traditions of baseball. For another, professional baseball no longer has signs for the swiping. A team could theoretically hack the PitchCom—the Houston Astros probably have a whole secured campus of evil nerds working on this opportunity—but until someone finally figures out how to bug one of those little suckers it will remain impossible to intercept and decode the signals between a catcher and a pitcher. 
Sign-stealing, among fans, was always considered a touchy, somewhat gray area of gamesmanship. Still, what the Yankees are doing would be considered at the honorable end of things even if it did involve decoding signals. They aren&#x27;t being subtle about it at all: The guy on second base communicating the pitch selection to his teammate in the batter&#x27;s box is doing everything short of holding up a gigantic poster. Against the Seattle Mariners, back on July 10, Trent Grisham and Cody Bellinger were gesturing so blatantly during New York&#x27;s late comeback that a baseball non-knower might reasonably have deduced that they were doing aerobics out there. It was a delightfully elaborate system: First the runner on first base had to peek into the glove of Mariners reliever Andrés Muñoz and spot his grip, in the seconds before the pitch was thrown. They were on the lookout for sliders; when Muñoz&#x27;s slider grip was identified, the runner on first had to then give a clear hand signal to the runner on second base, whose job was to relay this signal to the batter, in many cases as Muñoz was delivering the pitch. In order to pull it off, Grisham and then Bellinger resorted to what I think we can describe as an &quot;inflated tube man&quot; gesture, designed to be unmistakable for a batter whose attention is directed elsewhere.</span>

                              <span>Have you been counting down the days until our Monday crossword? This week’s puzzle was constructed by Daniel Hrynick and edited by Hoang-Kim Vu. Dan lives in Winnipeg, where he works as a laborer for Public Works. A commenter on his previous puzzle mentioned that they were disappointed that the clue for MOOG referenced the synthesizers and not Andy Moog. That comment was on his mind when he clued 1-Across in this puzzle.
Defector crosswords, launched in partnership with our friends at AVCX, run every Monday. If you’re interested in submitting a puzzle to us, you can read our guidelines HERE. Note that our submissions are closed through July 31.</span>

                              <span>CARCASSONNE, France — It is hard to know what is going on in the Tour de France, even if your job is to work on the Tour de France. The end of every stage includes a familiar ritual, with team employees and journalists gathering around phones and tablets, squinting into the harsh sunlight to try and figure out what the hell is happening. The team cars on the road are listening to race radio—which, as I learned yesterday, can be imprecise—or watching the race on their phones in the car; I have heard anecdotes about team car drivers getting info relayed to them by colleagues watching the broadcast from home. That information desert enfolds for the riders, too. This truth was most harshly embodied by former French darling Julian Alaphilippe on Stage 15 of the Tour de France.
The Tour de France&#x27;s 15th stage was unremarkable. Everyone was tired from three big days in the Pyrenees, and with a rest day approaching before a Mont Ventoux summit finish, the stage was the most obvious breakaway day in the roadbook. Both Visma and UAE even had riders in the day&#x27;s big break, as nobody had the energy to spend on chasing them through a hot day in Occitanie. UAE breakaway specialist Tim Wellens, free from a day of Tadej Pogacar duty, slipped away from a small group on a long stretch of rolling road 44 kilometers from the finish and soloed his way in to complete his trilogy of Grand Tour stage wins. Ninety seconds later, Victor Campenaerts crossed the line for second, and he was followed eight seconds later by a large group of breakaway survivors. Watching at the Intermarché bus, we joked about Astana doing a full lead-out to secure maximum UCI points for third, because while it&#x27;s a result worth sprinting for, it&#x27;s not one anyone will remember.</span>

                              <span>Everything about the NFL Players Association sludgeslide seems so predestined and unavoidable. The usual predicament has been made worse by disgraced former union chief Lloyd Howell getting confused about what side he works for and former president J.C. Tretter misunderstanding how work stoppages are supposed to happen, but for as lurid and goofy as the details have been, and with all due respect to the innovation of holding four-figure team-building exercises at a strip club, none of it quite qualifies as surprising. In the broadest sense, this is just the sort of thing that conflicted and ineffective unions do.
If only life in the labor trenches was as easy as the WNBPA makes it seem. They figure out what they want in a negotiation, slap it on a T-shirt, and have every member wear one; at WNBA All-Star Weekend, that message read &quot;Pay Us What You Owe Us.&quot; The T-shirt is not the important part, though. The key here is the phrase &quot;every member.&quot;</span>

                              <span>I can&#x27;t remember exactly what I was thinking about when I first saw them. It was one of those summer days that was defined chiefly by its sprawl. I had spent the morning at the gym; every year my trainer holds a charity competition for his clients, and this year&#x27;s was called Bench-A-Palooza. (Because I know our commentariat will ask: I went for reps and benched 95 pounds 14 times.) The ache in my arms hadn&#x27;t set in yet, though that maybe had more to do with the drinks we&#x27;d all had afterwards, crowded onto wooden benches in the sunshine. I&#x27;d stayed longer than I&#x27;d planned to, and evening was approaching by the time I said my goodbyes and started my walk home with two of my best friends by my side. We meandered slowly, luxuriating in each other&#x27;s presence. When our trio formed, we&#x27;d been young, and free enough to spend hours together every week. Now, these sorts of sidewalk chat were the norm: rarer, more precious.
So maybe that&#x27;s what I was thinking about when I saw the Henri Rousseau prints, custom framed and matted as if they were waiting for me. Or maybe I was thinking about how empty my fridge was after two weeks of travel. Or how mad my cat Oliver would be because my sprawling, luxuriant summer day had left him without lunch. Whatever it was that I had been thinking left my head immediately upon seeing the prints; the jungle greens were rendered exuberantly enough to be recognizable from half a block away. I approached slowly, as surprised as the tiger that I&#x27;d later learn lends one of these paintings its name. Another of Rousseau&#x27;s images came to mind, that of a woman and a lion in a moonlit desert. I have a miniature of that one stuck to my fridge.</span>

                              <span>Before the Mets&#x27; game against the Houston Astros on July 18, 1986, Tim Teufel passed out cigars in the team&#x27;s locker room. The platoon second baseman was rejoining the team after staying behind in Connecticut to be with his wife while she gave birth to their first child. Teufel, who was by all accounts a stand-up guy, made for an odd cultural fit with a Mets team that would become legendary and was already renowned in that moment for high-intensity dirtbaggery; Jeff Pearlman&#x27;s 2004 book about the team, The Bad Guys Won, revealed that Darryl Strawberry frequently bullied Teufel by calling him &quot;Richard Head&quot; until Teufel confronted him. &quot;There’s a breaking point to every person in their pride and character and who they are,&quot; Teufel told Pearlman. &quot;No man is going to just sit there and be a marshmallow.&quot; 
That Friday night, Teufel went hitless in three plate appearances in a Mets loss. Later that Friday night, after closing time and a couple of hours into Saturday, Teufel was beaten up by a bunch of Houston police officers outside of a bar called Cooter&#x27;s Executive Games And Burgers; Ron Darling, who pitched seven strong innings in that loss, was thrown through a plate-glass door by another member of Houston&#x27;s police department, and two other Met Cooter&#x27;s patrons, Bobby Ojeda and Rick Aguilera, were also arrested. That happened around two in the morning on Saturday the 19th, and the players were held for 11 hours before being released on bond. This was a long time ago. Darling is in his 25th year as a television analyst; the former Cooter&#x27;s is now a TJ Maxx parking lot; it has been a decade since the son whose birth Teufel stayed behind to witness wrapped up his five-year minor league career. But another way to know how long ago it was is that the news that four Mets players had been booked after fighting the cops didn&#x27;t break until the next day—Sunday July 20, 1986.</span>

Markus Hoelgaard nearly overcooks a wet corner and unclips to stabilize his balance at the last second, with our car and two motos bearing down on him a scant few meters behind. Alexey Lutsenko raises his hand to signal a problem with his front wheel, we pull over on a negative-eight percent gradient, and Kevin Poret pops out of the back seat with a fresh wheel. I time his work from the front seat: 21 seconds.
I spent the 2025 Tour de France&#x27;s fourteenth stage inside the race, in the Shimano neutral service car. It&#x27;s the closest I could have gotten to the racing without being on two wheels. A charming property of the Tour de France is that the closer you get to the action, the less of the race you&#x27;ll see. Proximity has an inverse relationship with context. I wanted to see what it was like to have both, and to understand the work of the mechanics who are closer to the action than anyone. Luckily, I was able to do so on the hardest stage of the Tour&#x27;s Pyrenean turn, a 182-kilometer beast with four categorized climbs, each of which has its own place in Tour de France lore.</span>

Paxton credited a challenging drama teacher at his Fort Worth high school for part of this, and the rest—the rest of the story, and a film career that unfolded over four decades, until Paxton&#x27;s death at 61 in 2017—was a matter of chasing his urge to make something with his friends. Before he went to Hollywood, Paxton shot movies on Super 8 film with similarly film-obsessed Texas friends he met while studying abroad in England after high school. &quot;We made films because we liked to blow stuff up,&quot; Paxton told Texas Monthly in 1997.
At the time, he was promoting Traveller, the first movie Paxton had produced after what was already a long career that began with his father finding him work as a set-dresser on Encyclopaedia Britannica educational films, Paxton finding his way into the orbit of exploitation film maestro Roger Corman, and parlaying his jittery charisma into gradually bigger roles. By 1997, Paxton had already spent more than a decade poised somewhere between character actor and star. The friends with whom Paxton had snuck around railroad tracks and movie theaters two decades earlier had credits on Traveller, too.</span>

                              <span>Billie Marten&#x27;s new record, Dog Eared, is a pretty major departure from her prior output. We do not hear a solo, cleanly produced acoustic guitar at any point on it. Our girl got an electric axe, a chorus pedal, a few more people, and did not look back. And I&#x27;m not judging! It&#x27;s delightful. The record has the sound that tumbling down a flight of stairs in a Dr. Seuss book might have. It wants to maximize the whimsy found in its sadness, which requires a rather particular mindset. While the sound is quite different, Marten&#x27;s writing typically conveys a loneliness that can rend your soul. Some people make music for being in bed with someone else. She makes music for being in bed all by yourself.
Back to me. The woman who introduced me to Billie Marten some years back did so while we were theoretically sharing a bed, though in hindsight I think I may have just been a way to get out of the house for her. She was living with her ex-boyfriend and his parents, but claimed to have seen the light and realized she was a lesbian. She told me (unprompted) that she wasn&#x27;t ready to start a new relationship until she moved out of the house of the old one. Then she hit me up out of the blue a few months down the line to alert me that she was now dating another man. I wish I could say that shit like this still fucked me up, but it doesn&#x27;t really—not because I think being used to this sort of thing is bad or a sign of the times, but just because I really enjoy getting in my feelings every now and again.</span>

                              <span>Perhaps the highest praise I can offer a book that took 27 years to complete and runs over 1,000 pages is that I can see why, and that it doesn’t feel like it. Sam Tanenhaus’s extremely long and anxiously awaited biography of the man who founded National Review, and is often regarded as the architect of modern American conservatism, arrived with a resounding thud on my doorstep. There is no way that a book the size of Buckley: The Life and The Revolution that Changed America could arrive quietly. It is, in many ways, a remarkable accomplishment: exhaustive but not tiring, serious yet lively, both affectionate and suspicious. It is almost dizzyingly populated with recognizable characters—the result of Buckley’s famed and enormous social influence—which offers regular satisfaction both to readers who like knowing what Sylvia Plath thought of the Buckley family home, and ones who yearn to learn more about cranky Viennese ex-Leninists. Most of all, Buckley is very clearly the result of slow thinking and methodical research, which makes it precisely the sort of work that its subject could never produce. 
William F. Buckley Jr. went for quantity instead. He wrote dozens of books, including non-fiction and a bestselling series of spy novels, both of which were mainly dashed off while on skiing vacations in Gstaad. He also produced three columns a week for decades, generated prodigious written correspondence, and appeared in 1,504 episodes of Firing Line, all while editing the magazine and accepting regular speaking gigs. For years, Buckley promised to write a serious work of political theory—he managed to produce thousands of words railing against his liberal enemies, but was ultimately thwarted by his inability to offer a coherent elaboration of what conservatives were really about.</span>

But seasonal shift or no, Cork vs. Tipperary promises to be a supernova of a tilt, and the toughest ticket in town, notwithstanding the upcoming concerts from the reunited Manchester band, led by Liam and Noel Gallagher. This is a mashup of historic hurling powerhouses.</span>

                              <span>After a month of controversy, Lloyd Howell Jr. resigned from his post as the NFL Players Association executive director on Thursday night, effective immediately. “It’s clear that my leadership has become a distraction to the important work the NFLPA advances every day,” Howell wrote in a statement announcing his decision. “I hope this will allow the NFLPA to maintain its focus on its player members ahead of the upcoming season.”

                              <span>Bill Belichick, aging boyfriend to emerging media mogul Jordon Hudson, will be the subject of an upcoming Hulu docuseries, per reporting by Front Office Sports.
Back in March, HBO, NFL Films, and the University of North Carolina were working out a deal to make Belichick&#x27;s Tar Heels football team the focus of a season of the Hard Knocks series. That deal reportedly fell through very late in the process, with Belichick insisting, unconvincingly, that there was never much mutual interest. &quot;The Hard Knocks thing, you know, like, just for the record, Hard Knocks is training camp,” Belichick told The Pivot Podcast, in May. “And we’re not training camp. We’re just not. That’s not what we are. You know, the drama of training camp, the who’s gonna cut and all that. Like, we’re a season, and they don’t want that.&quot; The New York Times reported days later that NFL Films kiboshed the deal not over anything having to do with the inherent drama of training camp, but because Hudson—who at 24 years old is less than a third the age of her doddering old lover—demanded content approval and &quot;partial ownership of the show.&quot;</span>

                              <span>What I knew of the eccentric baseball owner Bill Veeck, I knew only from stray web searches at White Sox games. What was a shower stall doing on the concourse? What are those pinwheel things above the scoreboard? While the trainer came out to check on Yoan Moncada or the pitching coach asked Michael Kopech to throw strikes, the answers to these questions were easy to find, read, and forget. Usually the research never went much further; my curiosity is no match for bad ballpark WiFi and dwindling phone battery. And usually, Michael Kopech continued to not throw strikes.
Last summer, Veeck popped up on my phone again for a different reason. On a slow news day in Chicago, he was the subject of a heated sports talk radio rant: The just-hired White Sox play-by-play guy had mispronounced his name.</span>

                              <span>While watching the Euros quarterfinal between Sweden and England with an eye toward covering it, I kept changing my mind on what to write about. This is a side effect of my job and my brain, both of which combine to help me begin to see narratives as soccer matches burn through their allotted time. Some matches are straightforward in this way: One team controls the game and takes the win, and isn&#x27;t that just the most boring thing to write about? Others, though, rocket between extremes, making it almost impossible to pre-write, even in my mind, what I&#x27;m going to take away from a match. Those are fun, I enjoy the challenge. There is, however, a third kind of match, unique to knockout soccer, in which penalty kicks arrive and suddenly, everything I had thought over 120 minutes of play gets thrown out the window, and all you are left with is picking up the pieces of a shootout. Sweden-England was, unequivocally, that third type of match.

                              <span>I do not usually have a fear that my friends will change, in whatever facets they may. Change is just an inevitable, wonderful part of getting older. There is, however, one exception: I have recently developed a fear that my friend Will, whom I have known since middle school, will eventually become a Bill, and as such, I will have to refer to my friend Will as &quot;Bill.&quot; This fear has led me to realize that I don&#x27;t know much about the machinations of the William Nickname League.
My family only ever uses my English name in the third person, so any nicknames on Kathryn in my life have arisen out of some sort of contrivance with my friends. As a side effect, you can figure out when and how someone came to know me by how they refer to me. Will, like Kate or Joe, can be a given name but generally is a nickname—specifically a hypocoristic, a shortened form without a diminutive suffix (-ie or y or whatever). How does one become a Will from, presumably, William? (I think about names a normal amount.)</span>

He worked as an engineer for Boeing, yet harbored delusions of grandeur—first of being an astronaut despite not being a deranged military test pilot, and later, even more embarrassingly, of being a successful comedian. In 1986, he met John Keister after an open mic, which would lead to his first television role. Almost Live. Almost Live! was a Seattle-area sketch comedy show which would air either directly before or after SNL. It really can&#x27;t be overstated how big of a deal Almost Live! was in Seattle. You talk to anyone in the area over a certain age, and they have a favorite bit.
I&#x27;m a little too young to remember watching Almost Live! live, but I do still have a favorite. &quot;COPS in [Seattle neighborhood]&quot; was a recurring sketch lampooning the show COPS and Seattle, but it is also a near-perfect time capsule. Here is &quot;COPS in Wallingford,&quot; with Keister patrolling the neighborhood that neighbors the university and was the home of many of the town&#x27;s artsier types:</span>

The Kiwi rider from Red Bull has just summited the Hautacam, a winding, rolling, and, today, infernally hot Pyrenean climb that takes roughly 40 minutes. A better verb for what he did might be survived, as he finished 63rd, more than 31 minutes behind the winner, and he is currently stuffing his jersey full of ice. I ask him how old he is turning (23) and wish him a happy birthday. In response I receive the most venomous &quot;Thank you&quot; of my life.
&quot;Shit birthday&quot; is a great, punchy descriptor for 2025 Tour de France&#x27;s first climbing day: a party that drives you mad. The gathered thousands love it; the riders, not as much. As we&#x27;d threaded our way up the Hautacam amid clueless fans riding their bikes as if trying to get squished, children screamed at us and dirtbag French guys squirted water into my open window. My comrades and I are denied turns on a luge ride reserved for VIPs. Riders cross the finish line excreting and then gulping various salts and are swarmed by TV cameras. Jonas Vingegaard nearly runs me over seconds after finishing. Emmanuel Macron has flown to the top of the Hautacam in a helicopter.</span>

That is not my perspective, personally, but it is very much a purpose that baseball has served for some of those who are served in some way or another by caring about the game. A career is a career, it&#x27;s a life in the sport, but it is also both an accumulation of evidence and a story told all the way through to a conclusion. They all end, and a striking number of the illustrious ones end in the same way as the more prosaic ones, with one or two or three last thwarted tries to see if that&#x27;s really everything there was to find or know.
But at the beginning, no one knows very much at all. Teams drafting or signing amateur players do so based on information that, for all the ways in which the process has been smoothed and sharpened by technology over time, is necessarily incomplete. The statistics don&#x27;t really mean very much; potential Major Leaguers are sufficiently different from the people they play baseball against even in college that their statistics often wind up so outsized that they&#x27;re impossible to parse. This can be as true for a high school player who hits .575 against other teenagers who will never play another meaningful baseball game in their lives as it is for an SEC pitcher who gets drafted despite putting up an ERA in the mid-sevens. Teams, or anyway smarter and more ambitious teams, tune the numbers out, or just down. The other stuff is what matters.</span>

                              <span>On Wednesday, the Phoenix Suns agreed to a buyout of Bradley Beal&#x27;s contract, ending a putrid era that amounted to very little. The team traded for Beal in the summer of 2023 to play alongside Kevin Durant, who was traded to Houston in June, and Devin Booker, the last one standing, having just signed an extension in Phoenix. Their skillsets were redundant, their chemistry depressing, and, despite their three salaries adding up to 107 percent of the salary cap in the 2024-25 season, they never won a single playoff game together.
Beal had reportedly been unhappy in Phoenix for a long time; since-fired coach Mike Budenholzer even yanked the guard out of the starting lineup for six weeks. But Beal&#x27;s contract had a no-trade clause, narrowing the Suns&#x27; options for offloading him. The solution: a gigantic buyout. Per The Athletic, Beal was owed $110.8 million over the remaining two years of his contract. He agreed to forgo $13.8 million of it, and will see the remaining $97 million stretched over the next five seasons. Beal&#x27;s agent Mark Bartelstein told ESPN that he took &quot;intense conversations&quot; to pull off the buyout; it&#x27;s worth remembering that he was negotiating against his son Josh, who is the CEO of the Suns.</span>

                              <span>There was a moment, near the end of my week-plus in Maine, when I could actually feel myself Becoming Normal again. The combination of relatively healthy activities, reduced screen-time, and a spike in omega-3 fatty acids due to increased seafood intake chipped some of the barnacles off my brain; detaching from the news cycle to some extent did the rest. I mention this not just to tell you how my vacation went, but because it was in listening to this episode that I realized how fleeting that moment truly was. We&#x27;re back.</span>

                              <span>There are only two pieces of media that have made me wistful for a small-town/suburban childhood I didn&#x27;t have: A Christmas Story, and Calvin And Hobbes. Before you accuse me of specifically longing for the tract housing of Ohio, if I interrogate this a little further it turns out that what I really wanted was a yard. Because I wanted to shoot a BB gun at imaginary bandits like Ralphie did, and, like Calvin, I wanted to build demented snowmen.
Bill Watterson knew, or at least captured better than anyone, the private derangement of the average 6-year-old boy. Imagination is one thing: Monsters lived under the bed, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, teachers were misshapen alien monsters in disguise, Tracer Bullet charges $50 per day plus expenses. But somewhere beyond those fairly standard fantasy worlds lies the grisly id of the artist, and the snow is his canvas.</span>

The flamingos were feeding, their long necks squiggled into the water and flat feet stomping in a kind of dance. Ortega Jiménez noticed the flamingo heads produced capillary waves, concentric ripples on the water&#x27;s surface. &quot;What is happening inside of the water?&quot; he wondered.</span>

                              <span>For Bill Guerin, who&#x27;s been GM of the Minnesota Wild since 2019, the beginning of this month must have felt like finally taking off an extremely tight pair of pants after a very long day. As a consequence of the team buying out both Zach Parise and Ryan Suter, they were stifled by three years of salary cap weight totaling over $10 million annually. That burden severely limited the Wild&#x27;s ability to build around superstar winger Kirill Kaprizov, particularly in a 2023–24 campaign where his 46 goals went to waste without even a playoff appearance. Now, however, the impact of the Parise and Suter contracts is negligible on Minnesota&#x27;s finances, so Guerin is free to do deals without those 30x30 skinny jeans crushing his waist. The results? Well, actually, not that much so far.
The one thing you need to know, if you want to know anything about the Minnesota Wild, is that they are the most &quot;slightly above average&quot; franchise in the history of the NHL. Dating back to 2013, they have missed the postseason only twice. But in that time, they have won exactly two playoff series, and none since 2015. Their regular seasons are usually pretty solid, but time and again they get walloped in a best-of-seven. By the time trophies are being polished, nobody anywhere is thinking about the Wild.</span>

                              <span>Let&#x27;s face it, we have been living through a pop cultural age—particularly in cinema—made in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s image. Before Marvel, before George Lucas sold Star Wars to Disney, Tarantino made nerd culture mainstream, showing that a movie- and culture-obsessed kid could bring that obsession to life in their own art, to great success.
Tarantino wasn&#x27;t the only one, of course. He was part of a generation of auteurs who were the right age to have grown up watching TV their whole lives, who made post-modernist art that seemed to be just as much a commentary on the things they consumed as they were new and unique works in their own right. Tarantino was just the first one to hit the jackpot, emerging in the early &#x27;90s with a showy directorial debut Reservoir Dogs and two buzzy scripts eventually adapted by big-name filmmakers Tony Scott and Oliver Stone. Then in 1994 he cemented his place at the front of this new wave with Pulp Fiction, one of the finest independent films of the decade, a cultural earthquake that is still felt to this day.</span>

Everybody knows about the MAGA hat. It’s red. It says what it says on it. The content of the MAGA hat is obvious. It’s a team hat, a cult uniform, a panting, sniveling dare for you to say something about it. It is, for better or worse, iconic at this point, the single image or object that exemplifies this movement, the illustration that will appear in future history books so long as Elon Musk hasn’t had Grok “rewrite the entire corpus of human knowledge” by then. But its iconicity is not just limited to its color and its catchphrase. The FORM of this hat matters, in part because it’s such a telling one.</span>

                              <span>You oughta know by now: This is Defector Music Club, where a number of our writers get together to dish about an album. Today, in honor of Bills Week, Dave McKenna, David Roth, and Lauren Theisen debate Billy Joel&#x27;s 1977 smash The Stranger.
McKenna: Stunning how few rock and roll Bills are out there! But Lauren’s suggestion that we take up Billy Joel and The Stranger took me back. Everything takes me back at this age, sure, but this record hit the bins at the end of the Summer of 1977, which I spent with my cousins in Astoria, Queens, when my feelings for Billy Joel were their fondest. I was into guitars and dirtball rock. The only keyboard guys I gave my time to were bombastic longhair prog rockers with walls of organs and synths, like Rick Wakeman of Yes or Keith Emerson of Emerson, Lake and Palmer. (This nostalgia wave got me to dig out the Yes belt buckle I bought on Steinway Street in Astoria for $5 that summer.)</span>

                              <span>To call it a &quot;pleasant surprise&quot; wouldn&#x27;t quite be right. As someone with an abiding interest in the colorful names and nicknames of Brazilian athletes—my all-time favorite remains that of Leandro Matos Souza, who went by &quot;Gatorade&quot;—I had a hunch that a particular theme week–inspired Google search would turn up the result I was hoping for. So, while certainly pleasant, it was hardly surprising that typing &quot;bill footballer&quot; into my search bar brought me to not one, but two mononymous Brazilian Bills.
Though I&#x27;m sure the player Wikipedia designates &quot;Bill (footballer, 1999)&quot; has an interesting story of his own, today we are going to focus on the life and times of one Rosimar Amâncio, the better known of the two Bills. Our chosen Bill is a 41-year-old striker who has traversed the globe in one of those far-flung journeyman careers that are pretty unique to a certain class of Brazilian player. Brazil not only produces more professional-caliber soccer players than any other country, but the nationality itself, with its redolence of jogo bonito and World Cup wins and flashy tricks and Pelé and Romário and Ronaldinho and Neymar and the like, means that the Brazilian player is highly coveted globally both for what they can do and for what they represent. Couple that with the Brazilian economy, which is relatively advanced but nevertheless struggles to provide a comfortable living for its entire population, and you can understand why it&#x27;s so common to find a handful of Portuguese names on the rosters of tertiary soccer leagues the world over.</span>

                              <span>The Buffalo Bills of my childhood are not the Buffalo Bills I live with now. They are certainly not the Buffalo Bills I’ve written about before on this website.
It’s weird to think about in retrospect. The Bills went from clockwork ineptitude to clockwork competence with only a handful of transition years in the middle, from the team I finally saw suit up for a playoff game when I was 19 years old to the team that has won five division titles in a row. From the basement to the top of the league.</span>

                              <span>TOULOUSE, France — They were going to make it. After working with three riders all day, staving off the pursuit of five others, and eventually holding off the determined charge of a former world champion, Uno-X&#x27;s Jonas Abrahamsen and Jayco&#x27;s Mauro Schmid rode into Toulouse together to contest Stage 11 of the Tour de France. One of them was going to earn their first career Tour de France stage win. The other would leave with nothing. All I knew as I saw the pair wind up for the sprint was: I was going to talk to the loser.
Breakaways succeed only rarely and only for reasons that are legible in retrospect. You need to be a strong rider to win from a breakaway, but more than that you need to be a good gambler, which is code for: blessed by divine providence. Moves off the front of a race only succeed when the strongest teams decide against expending the energy necessary to chase them down or, in quite rare cases, do some gambling of their own and leave the chasing too late. Chasing everything down is usually worth the best teams&#x27; while, so many breaks are by their nature doomed. That makes the ones that work extra precious.</span>

There is nothing sacred about the All-Star Game, and nothing really to mourn about the fact that a game that was tied after nine innings didn’t proceed to the tenth. But the fact remains that the Most Valuable Player in Tuesday night&#x27;s exhibition officially went 0-for-2 with a walk during that game, and that the box score does not in any way reflect the only thing about that game that people are discussing today.
Indeed, that very box score reflects the historical, artistic and essentially pastoral nature of the same with these famous and memory-invoking stars:</span>

                              <span>The Buffalo Bills open training camp a week from today and running back James Cook isn’t happy. A year ago, Cook flourished when new offensive coordinator Joe Brady introduced the team to the concept of handing the ball off. Now Cook would like to be compensated for his services before he falls off the running back cliff, just as his brother Dalvin did in 2023. James Cook is no dummy. He wants his money while he can still get it.
For other teams, this would be fairly garden-variety standoff that results in a camp hold-in before both sides agree to a deal sometime in August. But this is Buffalo, where any ripple in the waves causes Bills fan to have Bills fan thoughts. You never want to have Bills fan thoughts. A minor contract dispute with the RB1 begets thoughts about the rest of the team’s backfield depth, which begets thoughts about Josh Allen running the ball himself far too often, which begets thoughts about the passing game, which begets DEAR CHRIST WILL WE EVER WIN A SUPER BOWL OR DID I STICK AROUND THIS FROZEN WASTELAND MY WHOLE LIFE FOR NOTHING?</span>

                              <span>For a series with little by way of story, it&#x27;s impressive how many iconic non-player characters Pokémon has spawned. There is of course Professor Oak, who sets the player on their path to be a master trainer in the original games, as well as Brock and Misty, gym leaders who grew to be fan favorites in the anime series. And who can forget Blue a.k.a. Gary, the rapscallion first rival in Generation One? These are just a few of the endearing NPCs who have left a mark on both the series and popular culture across the series&#x27; nine generations of games. (There&#x27;s also Hop, from Generation Eight, who is very annoying.) However, my favorite NPC is also, in my opinion, the most helpful: Bill, the Pokémon Maniac from Red, Blue, and Yellow.
When the player first meets Bill at his house at the Cerulean Cape, near the second gym, he is not human. Bill, a Pokémon obsessive who is also something of a mad scientist, has seen a Pokémon teleportation experiment of his backfire, which has physically combined him with one. The player helps get Bill fixed up, and it&#x27;s all cute and silly. What is not silly is what Bill does for the player, giving them access to the Pokémon storage system, afterwards known as &quot;Bill&#x27;s PC.&quot;</span>
