                              <span>The Mission Impossible franchise is famous for its mask reveals. A dubiously explained technology allows an innocuous silver briefcase to print out a gummy-like mask that, once plastered to a face, transforms Tom Cruise into the spitting image of Philip Seymour Hoffman or various others, enabling him to infiltrate various lairs and turrets. The masks in Mission Impossible make for a fun game as a viewer: Is the bad guy you&#x27;re watching really a bad guy, or is he actually Ethan Hunt?
If Mission Impossible ever took place in a colony of harvester termites in the mountains of Morocco, Ethan Hunt might be, for once, out of a job. A new paper in Current Biology describes how the larvae of a blow fly has evolved to live, apparently unnoticed, inside the nests of harvester termites. Its main strategy, it seems, is the &quot;termite mask&quot; that protrudes from its rump. This mask features two antennae, a pair of sensory palps, and two large red &quot;eyes&quot; that are actually breathing holes. (Yes, the termite breathes from its butt; so what!)</span>

                              <span>According to the the 2024 National League Most Valuable Player award, Shohei Ohtani was the most valuable player in the National League in 2024. He achieved this status on a new team, his World Series-winning Dodgers, as a mere designated hitter who nevertheless put up a 9.2 bWAR through 54 home runs, 59 stolen bases, a .390 OBP and a 1.036 OPS. He&#x27;s one of the most amazing position players any of us have ever seen, but get this: He pitches, too!
That&#x27;s right. It was easy to ignore with all that he gave the Dodgers last season, but LA was only receiving half of the Ohtani package in 2024. Due to an elbow injury, Ohtani hasn&#x27;t taken the mound for an MLB game in nearly 18 months, but from 2021 to 2023 he was an ace-caliber hurler for the Angels, peaking in that middle campaign with a 1.012 WHIP and a 172 ERA+ off an AL-leading 11.9 strikeouts per nine. Here are a few highlights to jog your memory:</span>

                              <span>Across much of the animal kingdom, the meanings behind some creatures&#x27; gestures are reserved only for other members of their species. A person watching a honeybee&#x27;s waggle dance would not understand the information about a pollen-rich flower patch or nearby watering hole that the bee is communicating through its dance. Anyone lucky enough to witness the busty dance of the sage grouse will certainly be impressed—but of what, exactly, they may not be so sure. And yet I recently learned of a behavior in turtles called &quot;turtle dance&quot; whose meaning was immediately obvious to me, a non-turtle.
Without further ado, I present to you the turtle dance:</span>

                              <span>Connor McDavid scored the opening goal of Team Canada&#x27;s hotly anticipated 4 Nations game in Montreal on Saturday night, but it wasn&#x27;t enough for a home-team victory. The Canadians would go on to surrender two in response on frustrating mistakes, then find themselves locked up by conservative defense as an empty netter made the final score 3-1. Nevertheless, a date with Finland to end the round-robin stage on Monday afternoon still gives them hope, as a win would likely propel them into a Thursday night final weighted with the possibility of revenge.
Not a lot of hockey games start like this one did, as the rowdy Tkachuk boys and the rowdy canuck boys announced the intensity of their competitiveness from the moment the puck dropped. Brandon Hagel had a ferocious fight with Matthew Tkachuk just two seconds in, and after the officials pulled the two off the ice and put them in the penalty box, Brady Tkachuk and Canada&#x27;s Sam Bennett sabotaged the attempt to restore order. Officially three seconds into the game, the refs cleared out so the two could consensually hit each other until Brady executed a tackle on Bennett. A tiny bit of hockey happened after those penalty minutes appeared on the box score. But when Canada goalie Jordan Binnington froze the puck with 19:51 on the clock, it was JT Miller and St. Albert&#x27;s own Colton Parayko whose tempers boiled over, with Parayko using his size to hold off Miller&#x27;s assault until the two were exhausted.</span>

                              <span>JuJu Watkins was everything and the only thing. On Thursday night against No. 1 UCLA, she was the beginning, hitting three threes in the first quarter to send that awful she’s got it tonight feeling through the Bruins’ stomachs. She was the middle, literally all of it. When the sophomore guard found teammate Kennedy Smith alone at the rim in transition to start the fourth quarter, Smith’s layup was USC’s first non-Watkins field goal since the end of the first. And then she was the end. In the fourth quarter, the No. 6 Trojans trailing and gasping for breath, she blocked three shots in the span of a minute and scored two quick baskets to regain the lead her team had lost early in the third.
Not until the two-minute mark of the fourth quarter did any of her teammates finally break double digits. But by that point, there was no mystery left. JuJu Watkins had spoiled the plot: No matter how many times UCLA took control, no matter how many layups her teammates fumbled, no matter how sludgy the offense got, she would not be losing tonight. End of story.</span>

In a few months, that museum will receive its own prize from the Eagles’ win—an Édouard Manet painting, won on loan from Kansas City’s Nelson-Atkins Museum in a Super Bowl bet.
This is the second time the museums have wagered on the Super Bowl; two years ago in April KC’s museum got Thomas Eakins’s 1875 oil painting Sailing from the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It was on display for about two months. While it would be Very Philadelphian to have settled this bet using a Philadelphia artist, the Nelson-Atkins curators were the ones to pick that painting from the PMA’s collection.</span>

Rarer still is the scenario in which such a politician has an Indian wife and kids himself.
Vice President JD Vance found himself in those narrow circumstances earlier this month. Marko Elez, a 25-year-old enlistee at Elon Musk&#x27;s center for bussin&#x27; constitutional violations, had been linked to a Twitter account that posted things like &quot;Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,&quot; and &quot;Normalize Indian hate.&quot; Straightforwardly vile stuff, although I must note that if Elez really did attend Rutgers and major in computer science, he wasn&#x27;t trying all that hard to avoid us.</span>

This may have something to do with why a post about comments we liked from 2024 is being published in February 2025.
Things generally feel real bad right now, and that has a way of permeating just about everything. It can make posting a comment on the internet seem even more pointless than normal (which should be impossible), and it can make compiling a list of comments from one website (even our favorite website) seem like a gigantic waste of time.  But you know what, we got into looking through comments, and I found myself forgetting these feelings and laughing instead.</span>

                              <span>Donald Trump’s last-minute decision to release water into Tulare County reservoirs as a belated solution to the fires in Southern California didn’t make much sense to anyone. The water wouldn’t actually make it to Los Angeles, and the places in the San Joaquin Valley where it was going are more at risk of flooding right now than of drying out. Even the supposed beneficiaries of the water windfall knew that gorging now meant potentially being dry during the long hot summers when they actually needed the water. 
“A decision to take summer water from local farmers and dump it out of these reservoirs shows a complete lack of understanding of how the system works and sets a very dangerous precedent,” Dan Vink, a longtime Tulare County water manager told SJV Water.</span>

Or healthcare, press freedom, income equality, environmental protection, political transparency, child and maternal mortality, or life expectancy. But no one can say we don&#x27;t have one hell of a hockey team. USA! USA! USA!
Just how good this Team USA is, heralded as perhaps the best roster the country has ever iced, is still to be determined, even after a 6-1 shellacking of Finland in Montreal on Thursday night that served as both a barometer and a warm-up for Saturday&#x27;s throwdown with Team Canada. Business was taken care of against the overmatched Finns, even if it took a little while to transact. &quot;We either win or we learn,&quot; said Finland captain Aleksander Barkov. &quot;We learned a lot.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Most Super Bowls fade pretty quickly from memory, but it takes a special sort of dud to basically tape over itself in real time. Super Bowl 59, for all the highlights it generated and the broader satisfaction of its thoroughness, was more or less erasing itself as it happened; by the time it finally lapsed into the Rob Lowe-hosted game show that followed it on FOX, it was pretty much gone and the long sports winter already felt deep and endless. For Defector, this is both a challenge, because there just aren&#x27;t a lot of sports happening right now, and something of an opportunity to stretch out a little bit, write some anglerfish fiction and jarringly vivid descriptions of bad smells and the like.</span>

                              <span>Blue whales are not just the largest animals alive today, but the largest animals to ever live on Earth. They can stretch past 100 feet long and weigh up to 330,000 pounds. Being this big, it seems, should render blue whales impervious to predators. But just as no bank is too big to fail, no whale is too big to totally evade being eaten by the ocean&#x27;s top predator. Killer whales prey on nearly every large animal species found in the ocean, and blue whales are no exception.
In 2022, scientists confirmed that a pod of orcas can take down an adult blue whale, not to mention the smaller calves they frequently hunt. &quot;Killer whale attacks on large whales is the biggest predation event that occurs on the planet,&quot; Robert Pitman, a researcher with the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University, wrote in an email. &quot;There probably hasn’t been anything on that scale since dinosaurs roamed the earth.&quot;</span>

All it takes are a few accurately derisive tweets from Kevin Durant, or a photo of two players you thought were sworn enemies chumming it up at one of Michael Rubin&#x27;s awful parties, to be reminded that the people who actually play these games experience the sport in ways that are entirely alien to you, and vice versa.
There are moments, however, when the membrane between athletes and fans is at its thinnest, and the game in question resolves into a universal experience in which everyone is a fanatic. On Wednesday, Everton and Liverpool created one of these moments.</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s a document on my computer called &quot;food.txt.&quot; According to the metadata, I created it in October 2023, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve opened it at least every couple days since. It would be incoherent to anyone who sneaked a peek, but it&#x27;s a very useful piece of infrastructure in my life. It&#x27;s a list of entrees, basically, with sections separated by planned grocery store trips. There are no specific dates attached, but the list is reverse chronological: Whatever I&#x27;m going to eat next is at the top, and my future meals proceed from there. At the very bottom are meals I want to make but don&#x27;t have an assigned spot in the batting order yet.
The document is adjusted and revised often, which is why I don&#x27;t lock in any meal to a particular day. When I make social plans that involve eating, or would cause me to miss a meal, I do some shuffling. As I write this, though, &quot;food.txt&quot; stretches out eight weeks in advance—pastas, chicken recipes, tacos, even a tentative visit to a bagel shop. It sounds very intense, I know. It&#x27;s a symptom of an anxious mind that leans heavily on structures and plans. But I&#x27;m still kind of proud of how I got here.</span>

                              <span>Almost four years after agreeing to buy the Minnesota Timberwolves from Glen Taylor, Alex Rodriguez and Diapers.com tycoon Marc Lore have won an arbitration case that will allow them to finally take control of the team. A three-person arbitration panel issued its ruling on Monday, voting 2-1 to let them advance to the final steps of seeing out a contract they agreed to, which Taylor was trying to wriggle out of. The mechanics of that vote, and the process it guaranteed, are far more arcane than simply and immediately transferring ownership, but the upshot is that Taylor is out and the Business Boys are in. It&#x27;s the story of NBA ownership over the past two decades in miniature.
Taylor has always been a bad owner. This is not always the simplest thing to judge, as a team&#x27;s performance in the short and even medium term can exceed the willingness of its ownership group to do the two things that distinguish a &quot;good&quot; owner: pay the luxury tax for a good team and, most importantly, shut up and get out of the way. You can&#x27;t always get both, and many fans would settle for one or the other. Marc Cuban, former Dallas Mavericks majority owner and now Mavericks minority owner, was never willing to abide by the latter clause, though he regularly paid the tax when his teams were in contention. Memphis Grizzlies owner Robert Pera has learned to keep himself out of the public eye—after Sports Illustrated reported that he wanted then-coach Dave Joerger to wear a headset so Pera could personally call in plays—though he is staunchly unwilling to pay the luxury tax.</span>

                              <span>Manchester City and Real Madrid are arguably the two defining clubs of the past decade. Both have reigned over their respective domains—the Premier League and the Champions League—with unprecedented supremacy. Clashes between the two have become annual rituals that determine which one can claim the title of the best team in the world. But while most of the the names and faces of the current City-Madrid tie are familiar from those iconic matches of the recent past, if Tuesday&#x27;s first leg of their UCL knockout playoff reminded us of anything, it&#x27;s just how far below their usual standard these teams have been this year, specifically at the back.

Where family walks with leashed dogs happened down the middle of intentionally curved streets named after long demolished natural landmarks like &quot;Timbercrest&quot; and &quot;Forest Trails.&quot; Where the HOA (because of course there was an HOA) banned the installation of driveway basketball hoops.
Receiving industrial freight deliveries, freshly cleared through international customs, probably wasn&#x27;t explicitly prohibited in the homeowner&#x27;s handbook. But then, why would it need to be?

                              <span>The Civilization series has been a load-bearing pillar of the video game industry dating back to 1991, and though the series has gone through many changes throughout its history, the core gameplay has generally stayed the same. Players pick a civilization with an attached leader, then guide it from the early stages of humanity into the near future. It&#x27;s a tried-and-true formula that has had enough wrinkles to not just thrive for 34 years, but also inspire enough passion in its different iterations to have rabid fanatics of each game. (For my money, Civilization V is the best one, even though I played VI the most.) Civilization VII tries something new, something so fundamentally different that at times it feels like a Civ competitor more than a proper new entry in the series. It shouldn&#x27;t work, and it often doesn&#x27;t, but the evolution, really the revolution, that comes with the seventh installment of this long-running series is thrilling even in its flaws.

                              <span>In 1992, while Octavia E. Butler was writing her novel Parable of the Sower, Los Angeles was hitting bottom. The acquittal of the police officers filmed brutalizing Rodney King triggered a paroxysm of riots and violence in the city. To Butler and many others, it felt like the apotheosis of a number of untenable realities. As a writer of science fiction, Butler took the anxieties she felt—about social rot and political atrophy, about a vision of capitalism poised somewhere between merely dehumanizing and actively anti-human, about climate collapse and social collapse—and turned them into a story that was both more speculative and more full of possibility than the news. Parable of the Sower, which was published in 1993, begins in the year 2024.
The book tells the story of Lauren Oya Olamina, a brilliant and supernaturally sensitive 15-year-old growing up in a town that sits on the outskirts of a collapsing Los Angeles, and in every way on the verge of a deep abyss. Her experience of the dying world around her fuels a vision of a new faith, called Earthseed; when circumstances force Lauren out into that world, she and that faith are tested over and over again as she and a collection of fellow travelers look for safety in a very dangerous country. It&#x27;s not any more uplifting or much less harrowing than it sounds—I haven&#x27;t finished reading it yet, but I&#x27;m not expecting a big comeback for Society—and the many ways in which it has proved prescient do not make it any easier to take. But it did give the book, which was well-reviewed in its time and became a cornerstone of Butler&#x27;s legacy, a long and uneasy second life. In the fall of 2020, at what felt like the bottom of the pandemic, 27 years after it was first published, and 14 years after Butler&#x27;s death, Parable of the Sower became a New York Times bestseller.</span>

                              <span>Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid returned from his latest injury-related absence on Feb. 4, and if you were to look at his statistics across the four games he has played this month, you might get the impression that he&#x27;s right back in the groove. He&#x27;s averaged 26 points, 10 rebounds, and six assists in those games, and he&#x27;s gotten to play three of them alongside Tyrese Maxey and Paul George. Embiid&#x27;s on the floor and the Big Three is finally reaching an operational state; things are finally starting to turn around in Philadelphia, right?
The Sixers are 1-3 since Embiid returned to the lineup (George did not play in the game they won), and each has produced footage of Embiid that one might describe as &quot;alarming.&quot; He shot 38 percent from the field in last Friday&#x27;s loss to the Pistons, and in 30 minutes of action was able to put together a highlight reel of awkward flailing. Last night&#x27;s game against the Raptors produced what might be a new low point in Embiid&#x27;s season. Down two with 16 seconds left, Embiid set a screen for Maxey at the top of the three-point line and then popped into space. Maxey zipped the ball to his wide-open big man, who lined up a potential game-winning three, hesitated, awkwardly drove into the defense, and then just kind of ... dribbled the ball off the back of his own head?</span>

                              <span>I was sleepwatching through the first two episodes of Severance. It’s not an easy show to get into. It’s sterile because it’s supposed to be—it’s a show about a biotech company called Lumon whose employees have the option of severing their brains so that one version of them goes to the office (the “innie”), while the other (the “outie”) can just live their life. Neither of them ever has to meet—they do not share a consciousness. It’s a clear indictment of corporate culture and the modern workplace in general, the soulless bullshit jobness of it all, but that can almost make it a little hard to stay with it because it can be alienating. The first season has Mark (Adam Scott) leading his co-workers, including game new hire Helly (Britt Lower), award-driven Dylan (Zach Cherry) and company man Irving (John Turturro) on a mutiny. The second season brings them back, with Lumon clearly attempting a pivot to various superficial perks in order to lull the team back into sedation. And this is where we are in the third episode, with a confused Dylan being led to Lumon’s security room. 
When he arrives, it’s an eerie scene, like all the scenes in the series where some form of real-life attempts to invade the corporate space. A wall of screens shows a disarmingly mall-grade portrait of Dylan and a woman who appears to be his wife. That woman appears to be Merritt Wever, who just might be my favorite actress in the world.</span>
