So when Harris finally consented to a sit-down with three liberals at a Philadelphia NPR station for the National Association of Black Journalists, the title of the event could have been &quot;You Had Me at &#x27;Hello.&#x27;&quot; Not every question was a softball -- they pushed back from the Left on handgun control and denying aid to Israel.

Other studies and tests continue to reveal this same sad truth: We Americans don&#x27;t know civics. This is especially the case for younger Americans, who research has shown to be less informed about civics than their older counterparts.

                              <span>On Wednesday, Victor Robles was hit by a Luis Gil pitch, and jogged at the mound—to give Gil a half-hug. After a couple of walks and flyouts, Robles made his way to third. And with the bases loaded, two outs, and Justin Turner working Gil to a 3-0 count, Robles took off for home as Gil reached for his rosin bag, and was easily caught stealing to end the inning. It was the complete Robles experience. Here&#x27;s a lovable guy with enough pathos to befriend a wild praying mantis, and also a guy who will follow it up with one of the worst base-running experiences you&#x27;ve ever witnessed, all within the very first inning of the game. The Mariners went on to lose 11-2, which is one point in Robles&#x27;s defense: It probably wouldn&#x27;t have mattered anyway.
On Thursday, the Mariners were tied 1-1 with the Yankees when, in the bottom of the 10th inning, Randy Arozarena struck out swinging on a dropped third strike. His bat went sailing over the third-base line and nearly took out Julio Rodríguez, who danced out of the way and then forgot that the ball was still in play. He took a wide jog about the base, turning to the dugout, while Jazz Chisholm Jr. stood on base and called for the ball. It took a few beats for Yankees catcher Austin Wells to make the throw, but Rodríguez was still doubled off easily. The Mariners went on to lose this game, 2-1.</span>

The university announced this in an email to football season-ticket holders this week, complete with a video from athletic director Danny White, in which he describes the new fee as &quot;part of an extensive plan to continue our dominance in college athletics and build something like never seen before.&quot;

                              <span>When you think about it, it&#x27;s a bit strange that the best team in the world added the best player in the world, thereby forming a potentially era-defining superteam, and yet it doesn&#x27;t seem like the union between Real Madrid and Kylian Mbappé has been received as the monumental occasion it truly is.
Part of it comes from the collective exhaustion with the endless will-they-or-won&#x27;t-they dynamic between player and club. Watching the two make goo-goo eyes at each other from across the Pyrenees for four years straight bled the courtship of all its titillation, even now that they&#x27;re finally fucking. The other part is probably a response to the infinitely impressive but still somewhat dulling nature of Madrid&#x27;s success. So you&#x27;re telling me the reigning Champions League champions, winners of six of the last 11 European Cups, are the favorites to win the Champions League again?</span>

                              <span>Nightbitch is billed as a film about an overburdened stay-at-home mom who turns into a dog at night in order to free herself from her shackles. But it’s the night part rather than the bitch part that stands out here. This is a movie about a woman (Amy Adams) whose days have been stolen, who is pushed so far that the narrative has to contort into fantasy in order to break her out of her reality. This is her reality: Cast iron pan, sizzling butter, frozen hash brown, lunch with kid, walk with kid, library with kid, cast iron pan, sizzling butter, frozen hash brown, lunch with kid, walk with kid, library with kid. Time passes in blocks of repetition for this nameless mother who seems to exist only to complete the tasks that keep her child (not even herself) alive, one of countless Jeanne Dielmans pacing the planet, her identity absorbed by these mundane chores that mark the time ticking by and her life along with it. She seems barely there, even her epic earnest responses to outside questions about her life are only answered truthfully in her head, as she presents a frictionless surface. Or maybe not entirely frictionless. A slight grimace here, a pleading look there, something is starting to peek through the veneer. 
This woman is so alone in this temporal hell that you are surprised when a man (Scoot McNairy) suddenly shows up. And this is the part of an otherwise generic-veering movie about the power of motherhood that stuck out in my mind. Because Nightbitch is the rare mainstream Hollywood movie that not only dissects a particular kind of passive male uselessness—in this case the father who is barely there and when he is there is barely there—but how that uselessness can actively prey on women’s time.</span>

                              <span>We here at Defector have made our affection for Girona well-known. Even with the City Football Group ownership angle, it&#x27;s hard to deny that Girona breaking into the top three of La Liga last season was very cool. Hell, even as a Barcelona fan, I found myself pulling for a Gironiste title charge during the club&#x27;s season-opening points barrage, when it led the league into January. Though winning La Liga turned out to be just a pipe dream, third place and a debutant spot in the Champions League was more than enough consolation for a club that isn&#x27;t all that big, and one that often has served as a Manchester City feeder club.
On Wednesday, Girona made that Champions League debut in France, taking on the new-look Paris Saint-Germain—&quot;new look&quot; meaning &quot;no longer employs Kylian Mbappé&quot;—in the opening match of group ... well, there&#x27;s actually no more group play in the Champions League. Love or hate the new format—I&#x27;m a centrist, leaning ever so slightly towards the hate side—the stated goal of the tournament is to get more games that matter on the calendar. (The unstated goal of the tournament is to simply get more games, and more money, on the calendar.) To have the French champions, a veritable juggernaut, take on the upstart Spaniards ... that&#x27;s the type of match this new format was seemingly made for.</span>

Then, just this week, House Republicans blocked a bill that would have guaranteed a basic right -- never mind who&#x27;s paying -- to IVF treatments across the nation. Seems like we have a bit of confusion here.
Trump can bully House Republicans to do as he wants. He got them to reject a bipartisan immigration bill that would have immediately brought order to the Southern border. The bill was so...</span>

I did not expect much. I had not seen anything to bring a smile to my lips. But surely, I thought, Donald Trump or Kamala Harris had said something a little bit funny that I had missed. I was wrong. I stumped AI. Like the shuffling of a sixth-grade student who had not done the homework, the AI machines came up with a few lame lines:
For Trump, they quoted a comment he made about himself, &quot;Nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump....</span>

The blood libel accused Jews of using the blood of Christians in religious rituals, especially in the preparation of Passover bread.

You have surely noticed that a few months have passed without a Perfectly Fine Dinner Party Club Post From Libby Watson At Defector. Your friends have been waiting for you to host your next event, and wondering what the holdup is. I will admit to you that I did throw a Fourth of July dinner party that was meant to be the next edition of this column, but here’s the deal: It was not quite &quot;perfectly fine&quot; enough. It was inadequately fine.</span>

                              <span>There is a time and place to unsheathe five-to-ten of your toes out in front of your coworkers. Perhaps in a group swimming situation or something like that. The general rule, however, is: If in public you be, your feet they shan&#x27;t see. Jose Altuve failed to obey this maxim, and he was summarily ejected from a wild Astros win against the Padres for podiatric crimes.
Altuve ended the top of the ninth inning by grounding out to third, stranding the go-ahead runner on second with the score tied at three runs apiece and giving San Diego a chance to walk it off. Houston&#x27;s tiny second baseman did not even try to run to first, however, as he claimed he&#x27;d fouled the pitch off of his left foot. The video of the play (7:43 in the below highlight reel) shows pretty clearly that Altuve did bonk his own foot, though home plate umpire Brennan Miller wasn&#x27;t having it. Despite the protestations of Altuve and his manager Joe Espada, the play was not reviewable and the initial ruling therefore stood—which did not stop Altuve from unsocking himself to present evidence. Miller drew the line at toe reveal, and ejected Altuve.</span>

Normally, this is not how I would lead off a story about a breezy 10-1 win for the Mets over the Nationals on a balmy night in the final days before autumn, but I entered and exited the ballpark on Tuesday with crowd size on my mind. It&#x27;s been a point of anxiety for those around the Mets, enough that it was mentioned on both the radio and TV broadcast during Monday&#x27;s walk-off triumph: The team&#x27;s fighting with Atlanta to get into the playoffs with only a handful of games remaining, so where are the fans?</span>

Ethan Page is scheduled to defend his championship against Trick Williams next month, but the two could not complete a contract signing. It seemed the two wouldn’t be fighting next month, despite the pleas of NXT GM Ava, who is also The Rock’s daughter.
Then I remembered that I’d seen a little pro wrestling before, and had a strong feeling they would eventually sign the contact. I did not expect that the man who got them to sign the contract would be two time NBA All-Star from the Indiana Pacers, Tyrese Haliburton—he’s also an Olympics gold medalist!</span>

                              <span>Six episodes in, Industry Season 3 is rounding into the homestretch, and as a result, there&#x27;s a lot going on. Too much to catalogue here. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t try. It&#x27;s time to check back in on our beloved characters and bask in their various manias and journeys into delirium.
Harper Stern: Going Down As She Goes Up! Over the last three weeks, we&#x27;ve gotten the full Harper experience. Particularly on the most recent episode, where she is twisted by the arm to go along with using her only friend to pull a fast one on Pierpoint. Harper becoming the monster she was always born to be is a consistent theme of the series. Her revenge against Pierpoint, and specifically Eric, has been inevitable since the end of the second season. And both of her confrontations to end the episode, first with Eric, and then with Yasmin (more on that later), were excruciating to watch. It&#x27;s hard to say she doesn&#x27;t deserve it, but nobody on this show deserves anything good. They are soulless husks, obsessed with money and the power/exaltation of the sell above their own humanity. Nevertheless, Harper makes her big bet and for the time being it looks good, and that&#x27;s what these people live for, at the expense of whatever personal relationships they claim to want.</span>

                              <span>A good indicator that a friend group won’t and maybe shouldn’t stay together is when they have divided themselves into “saints” and “sinners.” That is, however, an excellent pitch for a reality television show, which is perhaps part of how we ended up with The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, which premiered on Hulu on September 6. The show follows eight women who are part of a weird TikTok group they call MomTok, which is basically just them posting videos of themselves dancing in different configurations and maybe also proselytizing? 
The three of us have been messaging constantly about the Mormon Mommies. Their hair is so strange. They are always driving in the car. They are so mild for a reality television show, and yet it is that mildness that perhaps makes them so difficult to turn off. It is less like watching any of the Real Housewives franchises than it is like watching a middle school sleepover without any parents around.</span>

                              <span>Marc Hirschi&#x27;s brief, incredible professional cycling career defies simple categorization, especially now that he&#x27;s winning again.
As I watched Hirschi race his first Tour de France in 2020 with a remarkable combination of enthusiasm, idiosyncrasy, and occasional brilliance, I thought I was watching the nascent form of someone sure to develop into not only one of the best but the most exciting riders in all of men&#x27;s road cycling. As he immediately backed that stage win up with a win at La Flèche Wallonne and ascended the podium at Worlds and Liège–Bastogne–Liège, I wondered if he wasn&#x27;t already there. As he parlayed his breakout 2020 into a huge contract with UAE, then spent the following three years more or less invisible, I scarcely thought of him at all.</span>

                              <span>A baseball player’s picture is worth a thousand words and, according to a new lawsuit filed by the MLBPA against online sportsbooks, lots of gambling dollars. 
The suit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleges that Boston-based DraftKings and the UK-headquartered Bet365 used ballplayers’ images without permission while promoting gambling offerings. According to the complaint, both companies inappropriately appropriated “nearly every active MLB player’s image” for their websites and social media accounts, “including in posts encouraging customers to place bets on the featured player.”</span>

In that vein, C-SPAN host John McArdle interviewed constitutional scholar Jeffrey Rosen this morning, starting off the conversation with thoughtful observations on the danger political violence poses to a self-governing people.
Likewise, a White House proclamation notes that since 1952, Congress has designed this date as Constitution Day and Citizenship Day &quot;to honor the timeless principles&quot; enshrined in the nation&#x27;s founding document. This being an election...</span>

No reporter asked press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre whether President Joe Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris plan to visit the town that has come to represent what happens when a Midwest manufacturing city of 58,000 absorbs the arrival of some 20,000 migrants.

During last week&#x27;s debate, former president Donald Trump said Harris &quot;wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.&quot;
Her allies reacted with shock at Trump&#x27;s accusation.
Rep. Jamaal Bowman, (D-N.Y.), quoted Trump&#x27;s line and then wrote, &quot;Yall serious right now? He says anything. He just put words together that scares people and barely forms sentences.&quot;

Cops cut off entire avenues to traffic. Soon a phalanx of police vehicles, followed by a column of identical black SUVs, whooshed past red lights.
They were taking former president Donald Trump to his home at Trump Tower. The New York Police Department was clearly determined not to let anything happen to him on their watch, certainly not after a young man of no obvious political persuasion nearly killed him in Butler, Pennsylvania.

&quot;In 2001, young men and women had similar political ideologies. ... Then, around 2016, something shifted, a new analysis shows.

With two minutes left in the fourth quarter of Sunday&#x27;s game against the visiting Connecticut Sun, Wilson popped out to the perimeter to receive an entry pass from Jackie Young. Despite intense pressure from Brionna Jones, Wilson corralled the pass, took two hard dribbles toward the elbow with her off hand, and pulled up to cash the 11-foot leaning jumper right before DeWanna Bonner&#x27;s help from the strong side could alter the shot.

In those 55 years, Nottingham Forest had not beaten Liverpool at Anfield: 29 matches, seven draws, and 22 losses, across the Premier League, FA Cup, and League Cup. Forest had been out of the Premier League since 1999, but since its return in 2022, the futility in Merseyside had continued, with two losses in two tries.

                              <span>At the most basic level, there is just no percentage in trying to parse a political campaign&#x27;s decision to try to incite a pogrom. It does a favor to the people doing it, for one thing, because even assessing it along the lines of any other campaign decision provides a cosmetic coat of reason to something that hasn&#x27;t earned it. More than that, there&#x27;s no sense in searching for a justification when the people involved know that they are doing something that can&#x27;t be justified. That is more or less why they&#x27;re doing it, and any supposed tactical advantage should be understood as secondary to the primary purpose, which is to see what they can get away with, and to begin seeking permission in earnest for something that is (probably) still impermissible.

                              <span>In addition to running the pig skin the main job of an NFL analyst is scouting. For me that means watching &quot;NFL&quot; Hard Knocks, a show that goes inside the mind of the competition. This year &quot;NFL&quot; Hard Knocks had a whole season about some guys at the New York Giants who sit around in their unremarkable offices and look at computers with lists of players on them. First of all: Don&#x27;t care. Second of all: Hey, where did you buy those office decorations—Office Depot? Is this a glamorous professional football operation, or a paper company based in Scranton, Pennsylvania? 
Let me tell you how I would decorate my office if I were to become the Head of Player Personnel for the Jacksonville Jaguar organization, something that many suspect is a distinct possibility. I would have a big office and in the corner is an ordinary-looking water fountain. When someone came in for a meeting I&#x27;d say, &quot;Have a drink from my water fountain. Oh, but it&#x27;s not water in there—it&#x27;s Red Bull.&quot; I would have a water fountain installed in my office that shoots out Red Bull instead of water. That would raise a few eyebrows, I bet.</span>

                              <span>More often than not, an NFL coach&#x27;s job security is tied to how his quarterback performs. This being the case, it&#x27;s rare to see a coach speak publicly about his starting quarterback in anything but encouraging terms. The most incapable bozo in the league can go out there and throw three picks, and his coach will still say stuff like It&#x27;s not one person who wins or loses a game, or We believe [incapable bozo] is still the right guy to lead this football team. This is because most coaches know that publicly undermining an already-bad quarterback will only make things worse for himself.
So it&#x27;s meaningful when a head coach, just two weeks into his tenure, has this to say about a play made by his signal-caller:</span>

                              <span>The final score tells lies, at least by omission. 21-18 implies a normal football game, and not a single point in the Commanders&#x27; win over the Giants was scored without some accompanying angst or absurdity. There is a very normal way to get to 21 points, and it involves touchdowns, and Washington scored zero of those. There are several normal-ish ways to score 18 points, and all the ones you can probably think of include field goals, and the Giants had none of those because they didn&#x27;t have a kicker. Just another Sunday afternoon for two very silly teams.
It was not exactly &quot;bad&quot; football, though both teams are generally very bad. It was farcical, and perversely entertaining, and maybe antifootball, but the players all performed competently. Do you know how NFL rules contain a few obscure, vestigial rules from the game&#x27;s messy origins, rules that feel like they come out of a different sport altogether, because they do? On Sunday it was almost as if the Commanders and Giants were playing two entirely separate parallel universes&#x27; versions of football, one where touchdowns were never invented and one where placekicking is forbidden, and the clash of styles actually made for some pretty good drama. These two teams and their fans will take competitiveness wherever they can find it, I suppose.</span>

                              <span>In Week 1, Caleb Williams and his rebooted Chicago Bears did something that nobody had seen since David Carr and the 2002 Houston Texans. And it was something good! No rookie QB picked No. 1 overall in the past two decades had managed to start and win his team&#x27;s opener, though Williams&#x27;s success came in large part thanks to his defense and special teams. In the 24-17 comeback victory, nine points came from field goals, while the two touchdowns arrived courtesy of a blocked punt and this gift of an underhanded pick-six from a falling Will Levis. The No. 1 overall pick&#x27;s stat line suffered from a distinct lack of pizazz—93 yards on 29 passes, 15 more on the ground—but a win was a win, and after an 0-4 start to the season last year, 1-0 felt pretty good for Chicago.
On Sunday night, however, Williams turned in a much more traditional tribute to David Carr&#x27;s legacy, getting sacked a bunch of times in a loss in Houston. This was a tight game but not a pretty one—19-13 was the final, with only six total points scored in the second half—and as the Texans boosted themselves to 2-0 primarily off kicker Ka&#x27;imi Fairbairn&#x27;s big beefy leg, they illuminated the uphill battle the Bears still face with the developing Williams at the helm.</span>
