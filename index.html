                              <span>Elena Rybakina must have figured she had the match won. She’d just battered 18-year-old Victoria Mboko in a 25-shot rally late in their Montreal semifinal, sending her sprinting from corner to corner until Mboko’s desperate lob drifted long. Mboko hunched over in exhaustion afterwards, her racket pressed hard into the ground as a crutch. Losing a miserable point like this, reminiscent of the godforsaken PACER test, typically comes with a hangover. The fatigued player often pulls the cord early in the rally in a desperate bid to get their breath back and misses by a mile, or produces a meatball drop shot. The score here was tied—4-all in the do-or-die third-set tiebreak—but Rybakina had all the momentum and a seemingly significant fitness advantage. 
So I thought. At 4-all, Mboko clobbered four forehands, but coherently rather than desperately. The last one tagged the sideline for a winner. Mboko grabbed the next two points as well to win the match, leaving my tennis logic in tatters. Rybakina’s epic rally just a minute earlier had somehow worked against her, proving the last point she would win rather than the boon I’d expected. That wasn’t Mboko’s only miracle act of the match: She’d saved a match point half an hour earlier. This proved too much for my Tennis Channel stream, which promptly buckled under the tension and crashed. Mboko broke serve to prolong the match twice, outlasting both Rybakina and TC’s notorious technical difficulties.</span>

                              <span>Every misogynist joke poses a question to its female audience: Can you laugh along? Will you be chill or are you going to make a big deal out of this? Are you going to be a bitch about it? Arriving in the form of a dildo, the joke that is also the question becomes a double entendre: Can you take it?
The first time someone threw a sex toy onto the court, during a July 29 game between the Golden State Valkyries and the Atlanta Dream, many players were inclined to say Yes, we can laugh about this. Sydney Colson of the Indiana Fever joked about it on Twitter, as did Angel Reese. And why not? As a bizarre one-off, it’s easy enough to laugh. Dildos, especially the ones that aim for anatomical fidelity, are funny objects when they appear somewhere you don’t expect to see one.</span>

                              <span>It’s pretty common these days for a television show to hold its viewers in contempt. Most “big-hearted comedies” treat you like a child, most crime shows assume you are very stupid, most dramas take for granted that you are easily manipulated. It’s not unusual to feel like whoever wrote the show you’re watching hates you.
The Sex and the City sequel And Just Like That…, which HBO execs announced would be ending this Thursday after just three seasons, is different. It’s the rare show brave enough to hate the viewer a little bit, and its own characters so much more.</span>

The beautiful shiny phone is killing us. We all know it, but there it is. We want it. It is made to keep us captivated. We are moths to its flame. Often, when I am around people I love, and one of us is looking at our phone, the other will say &quot;What&#x27;s happening on your phone?&quot; This is embarrassing. It is so rare that anything is happening on the phone. About 99 percent of the time, the other person says &quot;nothing,&quot; and puts their phone down. I see this in people in every generation. No one is immune.</span>

On Wednesday, a powerful loser and crypto enthusiast who calls himself Lt.

                              <span>There are only so many ways to describe a podcast, as regular readers of these little blogs already know. Because they are cut in two by our ad break, it is easy enough to mentally divide them; because they all begin with Drew&#x27;s signature skronking vocal overture, they all have a shape. But what does it mean, really, to say that something like half of a podcast is given over to soda-related discourse, and that the other component parts are about going to a Marlins game, the demi-crisis in WNBA officiating, and also a frank discussion about the frustration of duffing the preparation of a familiar recipe? You can put all that together and reach 100 percent of a podcast and 63 minutes, but also those things do not, on their face, fit together at all. I realize that. And yet:</span>

                              <span>Josh Naylor is slow. Not slow in the way that catchers are considered slow by default, or how some tall lanky guys seemingly can&#x27;t get their legs moving, or even slow in the way that Kyle Schwarber is. Josh Naylor is third-percentile sprint speed slow. Josh Naylor is the 16th-slowest guy in baseball, and the third-slowest first baseman—he&#x27;ll beat Triston Casas and Rowdy Tellez in a footrace, but if you put him against a fast shortstop like Trea Turner, he&#x27;s never winning.
But if you&#x27;re only counting stolen bases, it&#x27;s a different story. Turner currently has 25 stolen bases this year, on pace for a very respectable 35-steal season. He has been caught stealing six times, for a roughly 80 percent success rate, which satisfies the heuristic—though it is only a heuristic—of the 70 percent breakeven point. Not shabby at all! Bobby Witt Jr. has 30 stolen bases on the season and has been caught stealing seven times, for a roughly 81 percent success rate. Again, that&#x27;s about what you&#x27;d expect. Meanwhile, Naylor has 21 stolen bases on the season and has been caught stealing only twice, for an absurd 91 percent success rate. Those are Oneil Cruz numbers, with the caveat that Cruz has attempted to steal 15 more times than Naylor.</span>

                              <span>Tom Brady may be incredibly famous, obscenely successful, and (formerly?) outrageously handsome, but he has never been cool. This is a plain fact, one that Patriots fans like myself overlooked during his tenure there and one that Patriots haters loved to mock him for. Since his retirement, Brady has lost the magnetic appeal of his abilities with the ball in his hands, which has made stark his absent coolness. His commentary stint has been mediocre at best and awful at worst, and his unwavering but erroneous belief in his own charm is fully insufferable without the touchdowns and wins to mask it. In place of any kind of recognizably human personality, there is nothing but coach speak and corporate speak and brand consciousness, which makes it close to impossible for him to forge any kind of connection with an audience when he&#x27;s not wearing pads. That hasn&#x27;t stopped him from trying, which brings us to soccer.
Built in Birmingham: Brady &amp; The Blues is the latest attempt to humanize and propagandize Brady, and in a perverse way it succeeds at painting what feels like a true portrait of the former quarterback-turned-commentator-and-owner. This is not to say that the show succeeds in making Brady a compelling figure, or even a sympathetic one. Instead, the show—which is terrible for a variety of reasons, almost all Brady-related—proves what has been obvious for years: post-football Tom Brady is nothing but a platitude-spouting Robotron incapable of self-awareness.</span>

                              <span>LAS VEGAS — From July 3-13, World Table Tennis staged a Grand Smash tournament in Las Vegas for the first time. Like the Grand Slams of tennis, the Grand Smashes sit atop WTT’s tournament hierarchy, and with $1.55 million in prizes and main draws of 64 top players, the Smash was the largest international table tennis event to take place in the United States.
Vegas is no stranger to big table tennis tournaments. The city often plays host to the U.S. Open, which is run by USA Table Tennis and features a handful of pros competing side by side with hundreds of amateurs. American players who have been to previous U.S. Opens arrived at the Grand Smash already familiar with the little hells that a tournament in Vegas can produce: blast-furnace heat and slot machine-choked hotels on the way to a convention center floor, undergirded by concrete so slick that players pour out drinking water to wet their soles between points.</span>

                              <span>How do you respond to a guy who&#x27;s proven that he can crush your 103.9-mph fastball deep into left field for a four-bagger? Well, you don&#x27;t throw him your 103.9-mph fastball; you dissolve him with your slider. That&#x27;s how Mason Miller was able to begin his ninth-inning save on Wednesday night.
The Padres&#x27; big deadline add from not-Oakland was in the news for the wrong reason after Tuesday&#x27;s game, when Diamondbacks DH Lourdes Gurriel Jr. tied the score in the eighth by making Miller&#x27;s flameball the fastest pitch ever homered on (probably ever, but at least since they started keeping track of those things in 2008). San Diego recovered to win in extra innings, but it was hard to forget the fact that Miller&#x27;s searing heat had been made to look so vincible.</span>

                              <span>Anyone who ever met Wavy Dave and lived to tell the tale—which is, in point of fact, everyone who has ever met Wavy Dave—would tell you about his claw. It was big, that&#x27;s for certain, but this was not unusual for male fiddler crabs, which wield one enormous front claw, much larger than its counterpart. This is what gets the the female fiddlers going: a large claw that can wave back and forth quickly; the kind of claw that sends a message. These major claws can comprise more than 30 percent of a male&#x27;s total body mass, which is a big burden on such a little crab. But if a female likes the size and motion of a male&#x27;s claw, she may enter his burrow and let him fertilize her eggs.
But Wavy Dave&#x27;s large claw, according to those who&#x27;ve seen it, kept growing larger. On the first day he scuttled into town, his claw was nearly two inches from base to tip. But the next time he came &#x27;round these parts, his claw was even bigger. If you&#x27;d had gotten close enough to measure it, you&#x27;d find it had grown to a whopping 2.7 inches, making it the largest major claw on record for the species Afruca tangeri. You might think twice before crossing Wavy Dave.</span>

                              <span>It is perhaps unfair to the rest of humanity to slot Alan Dershowitz in as a specific type of guy. He fits into a number of variously rancid cohorts: Inner Circle Jeffrey Epstein Associates; Celebrity Attorneys (Derogatory); People With &quot;Harvard&quot; As Their Personality; People With &quot;Actually I Have Voted Democratic&quot; As Their Personality; Podcaster. But the category into which he fits the most cleanly is more abstruse, and has less to do with anything Dershowitz has done or the (many) scary monsters and super-creeps that he has represented, than the way that Dershowitz himself is, and the uniquely grating hazard he represents.
So while it is true that Alan Dershowitz is quite literally someone who got into a huffy argument with a pierogi vendor at a farmer&#x27;s market on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, was escorted from the premises by police, and subsequently threatened a lawsuit, it is also and more significantly true that Alan Dershowitz is exactly the sort of person who would do all those things, to the point where my first reaction upon hearing this news was trying to remember whether this was the first time he&#x27;d done it. And while I can now confirm that this was Dershowitz&#x27;s first pierogi-specific Martha&#x27;s Vineyard contretemps—as I was writing this, there was a second—there have been enough other things like it that it was a reasonable enough thing to be confused about. Give or take going on TV whenever anyone asks and writing books with titles like The Price Of Principle: Why Integrity Is Worth The Consequences, Guilt By Association: The Challenge Of Proving Innocence In The Age Of #MeToo, and Palestinianism: The Newest Attack On Peace And Human Rights And Democracy, this is just how Dershowitz spends his time—getting into weird public disputes and treating himself to outlandish takings of umbrage re: his seemingly very unhappy experience on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, where he has vacationed for 50 years, and then threatening lawsuits and recording emergency episodes of his delightfully named podcast, The Dershow, about it.</span>

                              <span>Oh yeah, Cameron Brink! The Los Angeles Sparks’ No. 2 pick in 2024 last played in the WNBA over a year ago, when she tore her ACL in the first quarter of a game against the Sun. There&#x27;s not really a convenient time for a torn ACL, but the timing of this one was rough: The injury happened just weeks before she was set to go to the Paris Olympics as a member of the U.S. 3x3 basketball team, an opportunity that once delighted her to the point of tears. It also cut short a promising rookie season in which she’d looked like she’d soon be among the best defensive players in the league. 
In the final days of July, some thrilling news popped up on the Sparks&#x27; injury report: Brink was upgraded from “out” to “doubtful” before a road game against the Liberty. The next game, against the Aces, she was “in.” She returned to play this month to fill a Defensive Player of the Year-sized hole on a talented but incomplete Sparks roster. On the very outside of the playoff picture with a 13-15 record, Los Angeles has heated up but could very much use some help from their young franchise star.</span>

                              <span>There are more intricate ways to measure a pitcher&#x27;s talent and effectiveness than the digits on a radar gun, but none quite so visceral. The Padres acquired Mason Miller from the California Athletics because of the fact that he strikes out an absurd number of hitters on his fastball/slider combo. That fastball, however, is thrilling just on its own terms, because Miller throws it an average of 101 miles per hour. When you see a pitcher with that kind of cannon, watching the radar readings becomes its own sort of sport: Can he top 102? Can he do it again? Since every fan has traveled in a car with a speedometer at some point in their life, that data is far more comprehensible than, say, inches of break. And when you see a number like &quot;104,&quot; there&#x27;s not much more that needs to be said beyond &quot;Whoa.&quot;
Miller&#x27;s first outing at a Padre, last Friday, saw him start by allowing two hits but quickly clean them up with a K and a double play. Returning to the mound in the eighth inning on Tuesday against the Diamondbacks, with his team leading 5-3, his stuff was just as eye-popping. But the results were a little rockier. Miller got a line-out to right on his first pitch, and he used his slider four out of five pitches to get a strikeout on Ketel Marte. But then he struggled to tame his own strength as he walked Geraldo Perdomo on exclusively fastballs that went by in a blink. That brought Lourdes Gurriel Jr. to the plate, with the chance to tie the game.</span>

I am of course speaking of the Fly Over slide at the Duinrell amusement park in the Netherlands, the first and logically only waterslide that was entirely filled with water, forcing riders to hold their breath for the duration of the ride. Unlike boring, standard, &quot;safe&quot; waterslides, the water was not merely a lubricant to help riders go faster have &quot;fun,&quot; but filled the tube to the brim and completely submerged anyone brave enough to ride it, and generated tangible anxiety in anyone who even heard about it.</span>

                              <span>Harrison Butker, an NFL placekicker best known for his wide-right worldview, hoped to parlay clutch kicks into political clout. His plan is not working out. 
A report released yesterday by the investigative team at Open Secrets shows Butker’s fledgling political action committee, known as Upright, is having trouble getting any lift. The PAC’s recent filing with the Federal Election Commission oozed lots of malaise and showed little money. Through the end of June 2025, Butker’s PAC had taken in only $4,023 in contributions this year and had just $1,786.43 left in its coffers. And, according to Open Secrets, of the $7,400 Upright has spent, “none of it benefitted Republican political candidates, either through direct donations to candidate committees or via advertisements that boost Republicans or criticize Democrats.”</span>

                              <span>ESPN&#x27;s position on the NFL is not unlike that of every other network with a significant sports presence, which is to say it scrubs where Roger Goodell says there&#x27;s a stain. The football thing is the only provably and relentlessly bankable thing in the entire play-for-play diaspora, so ESPN is handing a 10 percent equity stake over to the league in exchange for the NFL Network, the RedZone channel, and other NFL media assets.
The long-awaited deal that subsumed ESPN&#x27;s journalistic integrity, re: the NFL, is done. Alarm bells about diminished independence and the damage to journalistic integrity are ringing quite loudly, but in a diminishing number of circles. And besides, the days when anyone in ESPN&#x27;s executive class are expected to care about any of that are long gone. ESPN is the cymbal-playing windup toy in the NFL&#x27;s media orchestra, and that&#x27;s just how ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro likes it. This, to appropriate a quote from prototypical owner-without-a-team Hyman Roth, is the business they&#x27;ve chosen, and being bed-partners is simply the logical extension of the way it works now.</span>

                              <span>An estate sale gives you a chance to look inside a person’s life. Did they own nice silverware? Were they a hoarder of worthless little tchotchkes? Did they have a creepy doll collection? A normal and not that creepy doll collection? At the higher end, this can offer a window into a public figure’s private life. Maybe you realize an athlete needs money. Maybe you learn some movie star was actually a big dork and heavily into comics. Or maybe you find out that Larry King had a corporate-desk ornament hologram of Larry King.
King, the longtime infomercial pitchman and cable news presence, died in 2021. His heirs are finally getting rid of all his crap. The Larry King Collection is now at Julien’s Auctions, and there’s a lot there. Before he flogged loans on TV, King hosted a live talk show on CNN for 25 years on a set that looked suspiciously like the one he’d later use to sell fish oil pills. Larry King Live landed big interviews on non-Omega 3 topics with celebrities, politicians, and other newsmakers. The Larry King Cardiac Foundation’s website now directs to the spam URL clockwork-game.com, but he also did some charity work. He had public speaking engagements. He went to thousands of Dodgers games. People gave him lots of stuff. There really is a ton of crap to get rid of.</span>

The 28-year-old has not pitched in a game since being released by the White Sox at the end of March. Heasley returns to his original organization.

                              <span>I was scrolling the Steam store aimlessly a few Saturdays past, avoiding my various anxieties and responsibilities as a professional, when I happened upon a game whose banner appeared to be the old guy from Darkest Dungeon digging a hole (I wasn&#x27;t looking very closely). Enticed by the prospect of hole-digging, I investigated further. It was a brand new point-and-click adventure called The Drifter, with a bleak art style and promises of a grand conspiracy to unwind. I never buy stuff at full price on a whim, but I made an exception this once.
The game tells the story of Mick Carter, the titular Drifter, and his attempt to return to his hometown and pay his respects to his recently departed mother. Mick is also homeless, has made a ton of terrible decisions leading up to the point where we meet him, and has caught a pretty rotten streak of luck as well. His circumstances are such that his major problems are often interrupted by very minor ones, which are nonetheless just as obstructive. How do you face your sister after all these years away? Well, first you have to find someone or something that will let you charge your dead phone, because you can&#x27;t face your sister if you can&#x27;t learn her address because your phone is dead. It does a lot of zooming in and out like this, big picture to small and back again.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s all that baseball fans can talk about this morning: the huge memorable swing of the bat at the narrative and emotional climax of Monday night&#x27;s dramatic game in Arlington, Texas. An incredible, historic moment!
Allow me to set the scene: It&#x27;s the bottom of the 10th inning, the ghost runner is stationed on second base, and into the box steps Rangers veteran Marcus Semien. On the mound to face him is Yankees reliever Jake Bird. The Yankees are in trouble, and not only because they had to give an important inning of work to someone recently acquired from the Colorado Rockies: Back on June 6, they were 16 games over .500 and had the second-best record in baseball, but they are presently foundering, beset by bullpen suckitude, horrendous defense, injuries to all the wrong dudes, and what is starting to look like more than a fair share of bad luck. They dropped six straight in mid-June and then another six straight in early July, and have lost 10 of 17 since the break, including a sweep over the weekend at the hands of the Miami Marlins. They are presently third in the AL East, and falling.</span>

                              <span>At this point it&#x27;s clear that the Caitlin Clark conversation, for lack of a better term, isn&#x27;t going anywhere. Some things just become so ubiquitous and so useful as a culture-war cudgel that they can never be put down. You have to accept the fact that everyone is eventually going to get their swings in.
Let this process go on long enough, and you are guaranteed to see some things you never expected. The only utility that comes from typing &quot;Caitlin Clark&quot; into a search bar is potentially encountering a set of thoughts that you previously could not have imagined springing from a human mind. One day you live in a world where no professional sportswriter has ever taken umbrage with a league for not responding to three requests for comment about a player suffering a minor injury, and then the next you have to make sense of Christine Brennan doing just that. There&#x27;s some rueful entertainment to be had in these moments, which is all I could take from the Wall Street Journal&#x27;s unbelievably odd attempt at plugging into the Caitlin Clark discourse machine.</span>

                              <span>In November 2020, the Washington Post ran a story with the headline “Shakespeare wrote King Lear during a plague. What great work will emerge from this pandemic?” It was a stupid question at the time, and five years on, a cursory survey of the cinematic output that deals in some way with COVID turns up very little of significance. The films range from the justly forgotten star-studded comedy The Bubble to the superb, though substantively unrelated, Zoom horror film Host. Mainly, filmmakers rely on shallow, obvious references to recognizable hallmarks: masks, social distancing, toilet paper hoarding, Fauci. This is inevitably shot through with a degree of gravity that, while understandable, treads a careful, deliberately inoffensive line. Perhaps it’s because those early years were also marked by massive political upheaval and what might be, politely, termed social breakdown that it’s so difficult to fully dramatize what was happening. 
Plus, no one wants to think about COVID anymore.</span>

                              <span>Ferrari had a great weekend at the Hungarian Grand Prix, so long as you ignore the bad parts. After an upgrade package, the team has been on the rise. They are currently second in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, and that&#x27;s factoring in their double disqualification in China earlier this year. During Saturday&#x27;s qualifying session, Charles Leclerc even managed to steal pole position away from the McLarens (and, somehow, Aston Martins) by a margin of .026 seconds. &quot;Today I don&#x27;t understand anything in Formula 1,&quot; Leclerc said, expressing his surprise by the pole during an &quot;extremely difficult&quot; qualifying.
As long as you stop there, the sentiment is optimistic rather than ominous. And if you memory hole every other moment of the weekend, you will forget Lewis Hamilton&#x27;s Q2 exit—material evidence of Ferrari&#x27;s &quot;extremely difficult&quot; qualifying—and his shockingly despondent media comments after the fact. Every all-time great is bound to have some decline in form, but even factoring in the margins from his teammate this year, Hamilton&#x27;s comments felt extreme. &quot;I&#x27;m useless, absolutely useless,&quot; Hamilton said. Prompted to expound, Hamilton added, &quot;The team, they have no problem. You&#x27;ve seen the car is on pole. So, they probably need to change driver.&quot;</span>

                              <span>It is a measure of the history of the Florida/Miami Marlins that Sunday feels like the third-biggest day in franchise history. It wasn&#x27;t, but this is what happens when your franchise has two World Series victories and seven other playoff games in 33 years. That third spot on the podium remains very much available.
Still, you take your moments when you can, and this is the Miami Marlins&#x27; moment. The moment in question being when the Marlins swept the New York Yankees at home before 101,000-some-odd announced mammals over the weekend to get their once-dismal record to a deliciously mediocre .500, and in so doing moved within hailing distance of the final wild card spot. That last thing doesn&#x27;t seem like much, and it probably isn&#x27;t, but the Marlins&#x27; fan base has decided that the Yankees are their archrivals despite the fact that Yankees, who are in a different league, barely acknowledge that the Marlins even exist. Yankees fans weren&#x27;t even sure the Marlins existed in 2003 when the Marlins beat the Yankees to win their last World Series.</span>

                              <span>If conventional wisdom holds that international tournament finals are often boring and conservatively played, the Copa América Femenina final between Brazil and Colombia was a glorious exception. Eight goals, an under-punished headbutt, four total comebacks, a returning legend contributing yet another legendary feat, a tense if not stellar penalty shootout ... Saturday&#x27;s match in Quito, Ecuador had just about everything. The only thing it lacked was an upset, as the favored Brazil fought back time and time again to win the shootout, lifting its fifth straight Copa trophy.

                              <span>Jhoan Durán was one of the prizes of a busy trade deadline, moving from the suddenly tanking Twins to a Phillies team in a dogfight with the very best of the National League. Durán is not just an electric arm, but a very marketable one, as well. Along with his 2.01 ERA in 49 games with Minnesota, the closer arrived in Pennsylvania with his own A/V package. According to The Athletic, the Twins sent over all the assets that the Phillies would need to recreate the entrance that Durán&#x27;s old club gave him at their home field. That package includes lights, music, and an animation of a tarantula (Durántula) crawling across a video board.
&quot;We collectively thought, ‘This is for the greater good of baseball fans,’&quot; said Dustin Morse, Twins VP of communications. &quot;This is a fun atmosphere. All baseball fans should get to see it and experience it. We all know that the atmosphere at Citizens Bank is already nuts. This would go over well.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Miguel Cairo, interim manager for the woebegone Washington Nationals, recently referred to the Milwaukee Brewers as a &quot;pain-in-the-butt team.&quot; He&#x27;d just watched the Brewers rough up Washington&#x27;s helpless pitchers in the first game of a weekend series, and struggled to put his observations into admiring terms. &quot;They make contact. They put the ball in play. They find a way to create runs.&quot; It&#x27;s all true: The Brewers have the best team batting average and on-base percentage in the National League; they don&#x27;t do a lot of slugging but they swipe a lot of bases, and they will absolutely doink and small-ball your ass all the way to death. Per Statcast, the Brewers have the lowest barrel percentage and the third-lowest average exit velocity in all of baseball. These guys love to hit a baseball so softly that the bat makes a sound like the snapping of a stale breadstick and the ball flies into the outfield grass at velocities that would not earn a speeding ticket on any interstate highway in America.
Who am I to judge? After all, it works: The Brewers today boast the best record in all of baseball. If their offense is broadly outperforming the quality of the balls they put in play—Statcast says their expected weighted on-base average on contact is fourth worst in the majors, and their team batted ball profile is remarkably unsexy—I am inclined to credit them with making some of their own luck. They&#x27;re disciplined: They see a lot of pitches, and they don&#x27;t chase, and because they&#x27;re very zippy on the bases they put a lot of pressure on an opposing defense. For a team like the Nationals, one that runs out a bunch of sad-sack juiceless pitch-to-contact bozos and backs them with deeply lousy defense, the Brewers are basically a nightmare. Well-placed soft liners accumulate at what certainly feels like an exponential rate, overwhelming your very sorry and helpless baseball team the way flood debris conquers the pilings of a flimsy old bridge.</span>

                              <span>A computer screen is a mirror, a conduit, a threshold, and a void. We peer into them for work, insight, entertainment, communication, companionship, and we peer for so long that the outside world comes to seem like an addendum, an antechamber of the vision granted by the screen. “The internet has many potentials,” says the Japanese master filmmaker Kiyoshi Kurosawa, “and one of them is this ability to amplify what’s inside us.” Any desire, impulse, resentment, or prejudice: Like the characters in those myths of self-obsession told around the world, we gaze into our reflection, and disappear.
In his new film Cloud, those who touch this void become it, a game of annihilation where everyone loses. At the start, Yoshii (Masaki Suda) is hustling a small business owner for the last of his merchandise. The man has a sob story—he invented a medical device and went bankrupt—but Yoshii isn’t interested. He pays bottom dollar for the last of the inventory, and packs them into a rental truck.</span>

                              <span>The Braves and Reds finally got back to baseball at the Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee, even if it took them until Sunday! Sunday! Sunday! The game was originally scheduled for Saturday, but it began to rain late in the afternoon. After a long delay and an aborted start, the “Speedway Classic” resumed at 1 p.m. today, and ended with a 4-2 Atlanta victory.
A record crowd was expected. There was pregame pomp and circumstance featuring both Pitbull and Tim McGraw. Then the weather kicked in. The game was delayed for 2 hours and 17 minutes while it rained. When it resumed, the teams recorded four total outs before the game was pushed.</span>

                              <span>The days of WNBA basketball in Uncasville could be numbered. According to Gary Washburn of the Boston Globe, Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca has agreed to a deal with the Mohegan Tribe to purchase the Connecticut Sun, and he has aspirations to relocate the team. I bet you can guess where.
Per Washburn&#x27;s report, Pagliuca&#x27;s offer is for $325 million, which would be $75 million more than the price for a WNBA expansion team these days. If approved, it would be the most expensive sale for a professional women&#x27;s sports team. On top of that amount, Pagliuca would earmark $100 million for a new practice facility to be built in Boston. The Sun would have their games in TD Garden by 2027, even if that meant spending the early part of their season in Rhode Island to get around any playoff schedules for the Bruins or Celtics.</span>

While Aces fans didn&#x27;t get much of a showing from the home team, they were treated to a better effort from the contestants of the halftime baby race.
The baby race is the best: a game in which confused infants attempt to crawl to a parent at the other end of a court. As halftime shows go, it’s up there with Red Panda, little kids playing basketball, and either of the two guys I’ve seen who balance things on their chin.

                              <span>Jerry Jones has yet to find a contract negotiation he won&#x27;t drag out. Since 2023, the Dallas Cowboys owner has run the same routine with star players Zack Martin, CeeDee Lamb, and Dak Prescott: Lowball, refuse to budge in public, then end up paying more at the last minute. This recurring saga livens up the period before the season begins, and it&#x27;s certainly more compelling than any of the Cowboys&#x27; recent playoff runs.
But this year&#x27;s edition, featuring Micah Parsons, has taken an interesting turn. The Pro Bowl defensive end chose not to drag out this process until the start of September. On Friday, he publicly requested a trade as he explained his frustration.</span>
