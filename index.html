As a graduate of the Fetterman School Of Political Oafs, Banks attempted to defuse the situation by talking about the upcoming Knicks season.</span>

Maybe you don&#x27;t even think they&#x27;ll win the game, but you do know that every gesture is backed by some intent.</span>

                              <span>Broadly speaking, episodes of The Distraction that are just Drew and me talking tend to break down into two different styles. They can be kind of digressive in ways that are personal or just extra loopy, and then there are ones that are ... well, it&#x27;s still a podcast, and it&#x27;s still this particular podcast, but I was going to say &quot;focused.&quot; The idea behind this one was to field a bunch of listener voicemails and do a quick whip-around the sports landscape first, and what it wound up being instead was a decently detailed talk about the NFL, the state of TV color commentary, and the trouble with processing something as unprecedented as Shohei Ohtani&#x27;s most recent unprecedented season. And then eventually we get to the voicemails about cat poop. But it was a pretty thoughtful podcast for a while there!</span>

                              <span>Wednesday night marked the second episode of the 47th season of Survivor—and with it, the end of an all-too-brief era. For a certain member of the chattering class, this season held the sort of promise not seen since Mike White nearly conquered that Fijian beach: a chance to watch a famous writer make a fool of themselves on national television. This year&#x27;s media surrogate was none other than Pod Save America co-host Jon Lovett, a man whose list of former employers includes Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Aaron Sorkin. None of this impressed his tribe, who voted him out at the end of last week&#x27;s premiere episode.
This week&#x27;s elimination was arguably even more of an upset, but still, I found myself largely unmoved, if not bored. Some important context might be needed here: I&#x27;m not a Survivor superfan. I hesitate to even call myself a fan. Until last Wednesday, I&#x27;d watched exactly half of one season while high in an AirBnb in Burlington. If reality television is a spectrum, my tastes trend more towards docusoap (think Real Housewives, Wife Swap, Selling Sunset) than competition-based programming. It most likely comes down to the fact that I fundamentally do not understand the kind of person who would voluntarily spend weeks without running water. But what I do understand is podcasters—specifically the kind of podcaster that Lovett is. He&#x27;s the sort that will say on national television, with an ain&#x27;t-I-a-stinker face, &quot;And now when people ask me what I do, I have to say that I&#x27;m a fucking podcast host.&quot;</span>

                              <span>QUEENS, N.Y. — The final stretch of All Elite Wrestling&#x27;s annual September blowout at Arthur Ashe Stadium, Grand Slam, feels remarkably similar to the back half of the nighttime tennis doubleheaders that run at these grounds for the U.S. Open a few weeks earlier. Like the Open, there is a primetime segment that captures the audience at peak capacity—for AEW, that&#x27;s the live airing of their show Dynamite from 8 to 10 p.m. But also like the U.S. Open, there is a lot left for those who stick around late into the night—a whole other tennis match, or, in AEW&#x27;s case, a taping for one of their other TV obligations that stretches past midnight.
As such, when I leave Arthur Ashe, the atmosphere is different than the feeling leaving any other sports arena I&#x27;ve ever entered. The crowd is no longer a cohesive throng high on a win, crushed by a loss, or simply juiced from the action. It&#x27;s more a collection of individuals thinking, We were the ones who cared enough to stick it out, and Oh god, when am I going to get to sleep?</span>

I am the dad around this house, which means that I am the grillmeister. If my family needs anything grilled to imperfection—chicken, steaks, vegetables, shitty Mission tortillas—I am ready with my grill tongs and a generous amount of Pam. My grill counts as old now and, in grand American tradition, works in ways that only I understand. Only I know where the dead spots on the grate are. Only I know if the Blue Rhino tank is running on empty. And only I know that the two left burners will only ignite if you close the lid and hold down the ignition button until your knuckle cramps. This grill and I are simpatico. Whenever meat is required, we stand ready, together. I love grilling. Every middle aged guy does. It lets you play with fire, it gives you a chance to eat food before serving it, and it gives you an excuse to start drinking.</span>

                              <span>Eric Adams, the very weird, very incompetent, and very shady mayor of New York City, is also now formally accused of being very corrupt. Adams was indicted by a grand jury and is being charged by federal prosecutors with five counts of bribery, wire fraud, and soliciting illegal foreign campaign donations. The news broke Wednesday night and the indictment was unsealed Thursday morning; the full 57-page indictment can be read at the bottom of this blog.
This follows a series of FBI raids, subpoenas and resignations among the mayor&#x27;s confidants and cabinet members for a growing web of investigations that, incredibly, may be about assorted corruptions entirely unrelated to today&#x27;s indictment. Today&#x27;s indictment is mostly about how much Eric Adams allegedly loves Turkey.</span>

                              <span>The sea robin begins its life looking like any other fish: a finned, larval speck drifting in the open ocean. As the sea robin grows, the pectoral fins on either side of its body widen like two unfurling fans—still fins, if a bit extravagant. But eventually the first three rays of each fin separate. They lose their webbing, tapering into slender structures that look remarkably like legs. When adult sea robins settle on the seafloor, where they will spend the rest of their lives, they use these &quot;legs&quot; to walk, stilt-like, the rest of their body hovering a few inches above the sand.
Corey Allard, a cell biologist and electrophysiologist at Harvard University, knew sea robins as the fish his dad and brothers frequently reeled in from the Atlantic. But he did not realize they had legs until he saw them at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. &quot;Never looked that closely, I guess, nor expected a fish to have legs like that,&quot; Allard said.</span>

                              <span>Since the arrival of NIL and the decision that college athletes deserve to be compensated for their work on the field, the NCAA, along with universities, have done everything they can to avoid responsibility for ensuring that compensation is distributed in a fair and orderly fashion. The last few years have constituted a desperate bid to maintain the illusion of amateurism, and in that desperation the NCAA and the schools have turned to boosters, NIL collectives, and corporate sponsors to keep the money flowing. As a result, NIL, while nice in theory, is deeply flawed and about as lawful and orderly as the old wild west.
Many of the problems with the current NIL system are now fully on display thanks to Matthew Sluka, the UNLV transfer who has been the starting quarterback for the Rebels during their hot 3-0 start. The team is expected to compete for the Mountain West title and now, thanks to the 12-team playoff, have a real chance at competing for the group of five slot in the bracket. Sluka, who had spent the four years prior as a dual-threat QB at FCS Holy Cross, claims that he was verbally promised $100,000 by a UNLV assistant coach to transfer over, but has only received a $3,000 relocation stipend. As a result, Sluka announced on Wednesday that he intends to redshirt and will not play for the remainder of the season.</span>

                              <span>This week, some of the most prominent figures in American broadcast news tried to get away with a staggering lie. The story is a particularly instructive case study on the dynamics of the American media&#x27;s failure to accurately cover the ongoing Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza.
On Sept. 12, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced that her office would pursue criminal charges against students and alumni who protested the genocide by setting up an encampment on the University of Michigan&#x27;s main quad. That protest launched on April 22, one day after Palestinian civil defense crews unearthed a mass grave containing 180 bodies at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Yunis. On May 21, university police moved against the protest in the early morning and cleared the encampment, pepper-spraying protestors in the process. Nessel&#x27;s office filed misdemeanor trespassing charges against two of the protesters; the other seven face felony charges for &quot;an additional count of Resisting or Obstructing a Police Officer,&quot; per the DA&#x27;s office, for &quot;making direct contact with the officers&#x27; bodies&quot; while they were being arrested.</span>

                              <span>With two men on and no one out in the bottom of the ninth inning, Dodgers shortstop Miguel Rojas initially put his bat down for a bunt. This was the correct decision, from his team&#x27;s perspective: Shohei Ohtani was on deck, and Rojas would make an acceptable sacrifice to enable a possible Ohtani walk-off against the Padres. But swing the bat Rojas did, and for that, there were consequences.</span>

                              <span>The Pittsburgh Pirates completed a painful bit of business Tuesday afternoon, designating journeyman first baseman and refrigerator-shaped fan favorite Rowdy Tellez for assignment, effectively ending his 2024 season. Tellez was in Pittsburgh on a one-year contract; in all probability, Tuesday&#x27;s release brings to a close his days with the Pirates. The timing of this otherwise minor transaction is pretty icky: As first noted by Pirates fans on Twitter and then confirmed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Tellez was cut loose at the threshold of a performance bonus written into his incentive-laden contract. Tellez would&#x27;ve earned a $200,000 payout for hitting 425 plate appearances on the season; instead, after this last-minute maneuver, Tellez ends his campaign stuck on 421.
Ben Cherington, Pittsburgh&#x27;s general manager, insists this is an unfortunate but otherwise pure coincidence. &quot;Zero factor in the decision,&quot; Cherington said Tuesday, ahead of a game against the Brewers. &quot;Aware of it, certainly. I’m aware of the contracts that all players have. No factor at all, zero.&quot; According to Cherington and Pirates manager Derek Shelton, the team wants to prioritize giving roster spots to the players who are most likely to factor beyond the end of this shitty, disheartening, last-place season. In related moves, the Pirates released veteran outfielder Michael A. Taylor, also wrapping up a one-year contract, and promoted a pair of minor leaguers into the big club&#x27;s two fresh vacancies. One of these call-ups, 23-year-old Liover Peguero, is a gifted infielder with a somewhat faded prospect profile, the type of youngster that non-contenders traditionally do like to promote in September. The other, 29-year-old outfielder Joshua Palacios, is just a guy. Maybe one or both of them make the Pirates next season; for what it&#x27;s worth, both of them have already seen time with the big club and played their way back to the minors.</span>

                              <span>Rumaan Alam&#x27;s new novel Entitlement begins, as so many New York stories do, on the subway. It’s summer—&quot;strange, sultry&quot;—and the city is being terrorized by a &quot;lunatic at large who was jabbing unsuspecting commuters with a hypodermic needle.&quot; Creatively dubbed the &quot;Subway Pricker,&quot; the anonymous piquerist has already claimed three victims and the imaginations of the city’s denizens. None of this concerns Brooke Orr, who considers &quot;the pricker like Santa Claus or the tooth fairy, real only if you believed him to be.&quot; In fact, other than her new job as a program coordinator at a Manhattan foundation established by a white octogenarian billionaire named Asher Jaffee, very little seems to concern Brooke.
The headlines she reads on the train to work are &quot;anodyne ... the good luck of a boring moment in the world&#x27;s long history, Obama’s placid America.&quot; Entitlement is set in 2014, a year that that might register as anodyne in the nostalgic gaze of its post-pandemic audience, but probably wouldn&#x27;t to a 33-year-old black woman like Brooke. The summer of 2014 was the summer of Ta-Nehisi Coates&#x27;s landmark essay &quot;A Case for Reparations.&quot; It was the summer of the Flint water crisis, the summer of Elliot Rodger, the summer of the Ebola outbreak, the summer of #BringBackOurGirls. It was the same summer where Michael Brown&#x27;s body was left to bake on the hot Missouri pavement for four hours.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard to pin down Lamine Yamal&#x27;s place amongst the top players in the world today. I guess it should be no surprise that a teenager resists fixity, being in that stage of life defined by constant growth and flux.
The difficulty is twofold. On the one hand, you don&#x27;t want the allure of the new to rob you of perspective. How can you call Lamine the best player in the world for what he has done over the past six months, when, for instance, Kylian Mbappé has been doing what he does for the past six years? On the other, you can&#x27;t let your attachment to the past prevent you from accurately assessing the present state of things. Yes, he&#x27;s only 17, and he&#x27;s only been playing like this for the better part of this calendar year. But in that brief time Lamine has already achieved feats within the reach only of the game&#x27;s generational talents. How could you deny that what you routinely see from him, both in Barcelona&#x27;s colors and in Spain&#x27;s, earns him a place in the highest tier of the player hierarchy?</span>

                              <span>I could not help but recall J.K. Trotter&#x27;s charmingly deranged old Gawker blog, &quot;How to Find a Beeping Smoke Detector If You Don&#x27;t Know Where It Is.&quot; His revelatory technique: Once you have not found the smoke detector where you expected to find it, continue looking in other places until you find it. I thought of this as my wife and I hunted a mysterious high-pitched ringing sound around the main floor of our house. Trotter had eventually found the smoke detector beneath the bathroom sink (!), in the back of a cabinet (!!), covered by a bag of sand (???), nowhere near the sound&#x27;s seeming point of origin, a phenomenon he discovered was due to the auditory qualities of the alarm&#x27;s sound and the acoustic properties of his bathroom. (It&#x27;s a good blog!)
It was a sustained, maddening, high-pitched ringing sound, not all that unlike that made by a smoke or carbon monoxide detector when it&#x27;s actually set off. We couldn&#x27;t figure out what was making it; though it sounded vaguely alarm-like, it also clearly was not the sound any of our various alarms make. It seemed to be originating from the bathroom, but like Trotter&#x27;s sound, not from any discernible point in the bathroom.</span>

                              <span>This is baseball&#x27;s version of Holy Week, and because it is a much less regular occurrence than the tawdry religious hoopdeblah of the same name, its emergence should be celebrated by more than just those directly involved.
It is that rarest of rare white elks, a true multiple-team playoff race, and no it does not matter that the race involved is for the much less climactic extra wild card spots, nor that there are four right answers and roughly twice as many quizzers. It is the beauteous chaos of simultaneous events all emanating import into other corners of the world. Or in English, it&#x27;s the Royals, Tigers, Twins, and Mariners all fighting for the two American League wild card spots not already claimed by the Orioles, and the Diamondbacks, Mets, and Braves for the final two National League vacancies. All those teams have their evident flaws and alluring charms and fan bases that simultaneously warm the hearts and irritate the spleens; the winners will all both be considerable underdogs against their first-round opponents and teams with not entirely specious hopes for an improbable run deeper into the fall.</span>

                              <span>Thanks to those of you who joined us for our discussion of In the Freud Archives back in August. Not long after we finished DRAB-ing, I found myself with a free afternoon in Berkeley, and took myself out to the upstairs cafe at Chez Panisse. I left the meal with a 60 percent water, 40 percent roasted fig body composition. I can see why Jeff Masson wanted to dine there. If any of my future interview subjects would like to make plans there, you have my permission. Let’s expense some figs to the company.
This fall, we&#x27;re doing something we never do at Defector Reads A Book. You know us by now: We&#x27;re the sort of book club that skews Beowulf and Moby Dick. In a twist, we&#x27;re reading a book that is not hundreds of years old—one that, in fact, just came out today. A group of Sally Rooney newbies and completists on staff is gathering to chat Intermezzo, the buzzy Irish novelist&#x27;s fourth novel. Could this be the great Marxist chess novel of our time? We&#x27;ll have to ask Patrick.</span>

Kennedy Jr., many of the most powerful people in journalism are asking, rhetorically, Why are people making such a big deal about this? That&#x27;s not a question to be dismissed out of hand simply because other people also happen to be mad at Nuzzi for stupid reasons.
Dead-eyed hacks like Caitlin Flanagan and Chris Cillizza have made their predictable cases, as has former Buzzfeed editor-in-chief and New York Times media columnist Ben Smith. Smith, of Smith &amp; Smith Media, addressed the scandal in a confused edition of his newsletter over the weekend. Against the &quot;full fury of American media prurience and self-righteousness,&quot; Smith&#x27;s defense of Nuzzi is that to draw the ethical line at engaging in a sexual relationship with a reporting subject is arbitrary, and that the work of reporting is inherently compromising:</span>

                              <span>This Formula 1 season has gotten so topsy-turvy that it fell on Max Verstappen of all drivers to make a boring Singapore Grand Prix suddenly exciting. Thanks to Red Bull&#x27;s shabby performance, mysteriously cratered over the past few months, the excitement came not from the Dutchman&#x27;s driving, but from his mouth. At a press conference on Thursday, Verstappen was asked about qualifying at the previous week&#x27;s grand prix circuit in Baku. His reply was characteristically blunt: &quot;As soon as I headed into qualifying, I knew the car was fucked.&quot;
For a racing entity that also has Yuki Tsunoda and Yuki Tsunoda&#x27;s famously inappropriate mouth on its roster, this comment should not have rated beyond mild amusement. However, the Federation Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (or FIA, the F1 governing body) issued a warning for drivers to watch their language following the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. That warning was received poorly going into the Singapore GP weekend, with Lando Norris noting that it&#x27;s hard to control the language in the heat of the moment. Norris told The Athletic, &quot;They can just not play the radios, so it’s quite simple from their side.&quot;</span>

                              <span>On June 6, a baby-faced TikTok user named Louis, who adorns his username with two Reichskreuze—the Imperial Cross that’s often used as a neo-Nazi symbol—commented “Saxony Anhalt votes blue,” followed by a blue heart emoji, under politician Alice Weidel’s video urging people to vote AfD, the far-right Alternative for Germany party, for the 2024 EU parliamentary elections. A quick scroll down Louis’s page immediately shows two racist memes, one about Muslims and another about Black people. AfD in Saxony-Anhalt has been officially classified as an extremist group. 
Weidel’s video features an anime-style cartoon of a young man excitedly voting for the AfD. A German flag flashes before the boy’s eyes, making him quiver with joy. The entire comments section is filled with blue hearts, the color of the AfD. The video ends with the hashtag “blue instead of colorful,” referring to a rejection of the “woke madness” that embraces diversity. The youthfulness and playful animation of the video may stand in stark contrast with its deeply hateful message, but its makers know exactly who they’re targeting.</span>

                              <span>The Washington Nationals made a sudden and alarming roster move on Friday, optioning 23-year-old all-star shortstop C.J. Abrams to their Triple-A team in Rochester. If the Nationals were good—if they were overstocked with primo young hitting talent, like, say, the Baltimore Orioles—it would be possible to slide this move by as an unfortunate consequence of roster crunch. And, indeed, the Orioles also optioned a talented youngster on the same day, sending hulking 22-year-old infielder and reigning organizational Minor League Player of the Year Coby Mayo back to Norfolk, effectively ending his season. Good teams can have reasons for making painful late-season roster moves that are, if not entirely wholesome, at least coherent within the context of a competitive enterprise. This is not that.
The Nationals are not good, and there&#x27;s no one anywhere in the organization to slide all that comfortably into Abrams&#x27;s spot in the field or in the lineup. Abrams&#x27;s demotion is a disciplinary measure: As first reported by Cody Delmendo of CHGO Sports and later confirmed by Jesse Rogers of ESPN, Abrams was seen living it up at a Chicago casino until 8:00 a.m. Friday morning, and then had to suit up for a 2:00 p.m. game against the Cubs that same afternoon. After the game—Abrams went 0-for-3 with a walk in the leadoff spot, in a 3–1 loss—Nationals coach Davey Martinez pulled Abrams into a long and emotional meeting and informed him that his season was over. The Nationals haven&#x27;t exactly ratted Abrams out, but everything in their tone and demeanor confirms the scoop.</span>

                              <span>To take the old saying and mangle it in the back shop a bit, you cannot hope to beat the Las Vegas Raiders because they are so easy to contain. The latest person to learn this lesson is their 12-game-old head coach.
Antonio Pierce was advertised as the franchise’s latest savior, the coach that this historically listless roster would respond to after enduring The Josh McDaniels Experience; with Pierce setting the example, the team would vibrate with joyful devotion to the greater cause. So trusting. So naive. But these are the Raiders, who have talked it while steadfastly refusing to walk it for two full decades and change now. This is an organization that goes from &quot;Hey, who&#x27;s the new guy?&quot; to &quot;Hey, when are we getting a new guy?&quot; with uncommon swiftness. It&#x27;s why, since they lost Super Bowl The 37th back in &#x27;Ought Two, Raiders coaches have averaged 26 games between hiring and firing. That&#x27;s barely a season and a half.</span>

                              <span>One of the things that has always been captivating to me about the TV show Alone is how it illustrates our endless capacity for invention in the absolute worst of times. It&#x27;s a reality show about survival, but really what that means is adaptability. When you lose a supply of arrows, can you fashion more from branches and scavenged parts? Do you know how to use sphagnum moss to treat a wound after an unfortunate ax misadventure? If a crafty vole has raided your stores of fish, will you be able to find more food or resort to gnarly bark-based teas and intermittent fasting as the frost sets in?
It&#x27;s a manufactured danger. But part of the appeal is that there&#x27;s no one coming to the rescue. Ultimately you survive and win, or wind up another sucker ferried back to civilization after an intense flirtation with giardia. Either way, these people have to figure out a new way to live every day.</span>

                              <span>In the Premier League&#x27;s marquee showdown of the weekend, last year&#x27;s number one and number two faced off in an early clash of titans that already had title implications. Arsenal retooled this summer in order to better pursue Manchester City for a third straight season, bringing in defender Riccardo Calafiori, midfielder Mikel Merino, and forward Raheem Sterling. Sunday was Arsenal&#x27;s first crack at City this season, and though the visiting side gave up a goal to—who else—Erling Haaland in the ninth minute, the Gunners took control of the match with goals from two defenders: Calafiori tied it up in the 22nd with an incredible rocket from outside the box, and then Gabriel gave Arsenal the lead in the first minute of first half stoppage time with a rising header off a corner.

                              <span>There were some recognizable elements of the Singapore Grand Prix this year: a night race with hot weather, heavy humidity, a dew point no doubt off the charts. Correspondingly, there was tired, occasionally frustrated driving on a street circuit not built for overtakes, though this year they tried to rectify this issue by increasing the total number of DRS zones to four. Four! The saving grace for Singapore has also been its most defining characteristic: its propensity for safety cars. But this year, with some luck and a lot of engine reliability, there was nothing. 
This year&#x27;s race was won or lost in discrete moments. Ferrari lost it after a horrific qualifying; you can&#x27;t recover from P9 and P10 on the grid on a track like Singapore. Lewis Hamilton lost it after a call to put him on old soft tires to start the race; he failed to grab the all-important track position on the opening lap, and didn&#x27;t have the tires to last him to the end. And Lando Norris won it by finally converting pole position to a lap-one lead for the first time so far this season, putting to bed—or, at least, a nap—one of the most persistent criticisms levied at his driving this year.</span>

Nearly as prevalent in my feeds are the de-influencing videos. While influencers work to persuade their audience to buy products they may or may not need in the hopes of getting a few cents of commission, de-influencers remind people why they don’t need to spend their money. De-influencing material ranges from explaining why individual viral products aren&#x27;t worth buying to entire accounts built to remind audiences that hauls aren&#x27;t normal and call out undisclosed ads or partnerships with brands. De-influencing is part of a larger populist turn I&#x27;ve noticed in response to the omnipresent commercialization of the social internet, but it also exemplifies one of the internet&#x27;s signal conundrums: Is it possible to create anticapitalist work on social media?</span>

                              <span>&quot;No loss is good,&quot; said Chicago White Sox interim manager Grady Sizemore, a statement which, rather than defusing the potency of Sunday&#x27;s milestone loss, merely diffuses it across a season: If no loss is good, then each loss is bad, which means 120 losses are a death march unseen in the days of widespread color TV. That&#x27;s 120 days of feeling bad at the ballpark; 120 unsatisfied nights, wishing for a better tomorrow that rarely comes. Thirty-six chances for the South Side to stand up, weighed against 120 blunt remonstrances to remain seated.
The 43-119 Detroit Tigers of 2003 are now in the rearview mirror, still notable for possessing the last 20-game loser in Mike Maroth but no longer for owning the AL&#x27;s worst record of the modern era. The 40-120-1 New York Mets of 1962 are next up. One of the first expansion teams, before MLB had balanced its expansion rules to avoid putting out true stinkers, those Mets were wretched but charmingly pitiable, like an Instagram chihuahua. They made their own manager ask, &quot;Can&#x27;t anybody here play this game?&quot; They were and are baseball&#x27;s touchstone for terrible. And they were a better team than the 2024 Chicago White Sox.</span>

                              <span>At the end of the first quarter of their opening playoff game against the Las Vegas Aces, the Seattle Storm couldn&#x27;t have found themselves in a much better position. They were leading 18-9, having held the Aces to just 11 percent shooting from the field. Unanimous MVP A&#x27;ja Wilson, who had just received her trophy in a pregame ceremony, was 1-of-8. The Storm were cooking.
If a blueprint exists for Seattle getting past Vegas in this best-of-three first-round matchup, it looks a lot like what happened in that first quarter. The Storm, always a defense-first unit, were playing with an intensity and speed that totally discombobulated the Aces&#x27; offense. Even without defensive anchor Ezi Magbegor, Seattle&#x27;s collection of defensive hawks were switching and sliding and blitzing fast enough to make Wilson and the Aces look slow and ponderous. Every shot at the rim was contested, and Seattle&#x27;s traps and rotations fired so quickly that they looked less like a basketball team scrambling to cover the court than a well-drilled soccer team executing a perfect counter-press.</span>

                              <span>Through the better part of three quarters of football on Sunday afternoon, the Philadelphia Eagles and New Orleans Saints were locked in a world&#x27;s ugliest dog contest. Just one week earlier the Saints were rolling over the haunted remains of the Cowboys and everyone got a piece of the action; Alvin Kamara got four touchdowns, quarterback Derek Carr threw for 243 yards and two touchdowns and even got in on a QB sneak on the way to a 44-19 win. 
On Sunday they led 3-0 thanks to an early field goal and Eagles coach Nick Sirianni&#x27;s commitment to salvaging genius from ineptitude. The birds had three blown fourth downs early in the game: a blocked punt, a Jalen Hurts sack after a too many men on the field penalty, and a busted run play at the end of the first half in place of an easy field goal.</span>

                              <span>Fifty-three points. That&#x27;s how much Sun Belt juggernaut James Madison University had at halftime against the University of North Carolina on the way to a 70-50 blowout. But that final score does no justice to the absolute ass beating that the Dukes conveyed in Saturday&#x27;s matchup.
That 53 points scored in a half is the most points James Madison has ever scored in one half and the most points North Carolina has ever allowed in a half. It&#x27;s also the most points a power conference team has given up to a Group of 5 team since 2012. James Madison forced four turnovers, including a pick-six and a blocked punt return for a touchdown in just the first half. The Dukes notched five turnovers in total and for added measure—or humiliation—recovered their own surprise onside kick. James Madison quarterback Alonza Barnett III finished the game with seven total touchdowns, breaking the record for most touchdowns by a Dukes quarterback in a single game, going 22-for-34 and 388 total yards, adding two touchdowns off 64 yards on the ground.</span>

                              <span>Last night, going into the midnight hour, I found myself gripped by a Big 12 conference game between two unranked, mediocre teams. This isn&#x27;t atypical for me, particularly this season, but what is unusual is how many others seemed to be watching alongside me based on social media. That&#x27;s the thing about the Colorado Buffaloes, despite how average they are, people can&#x27;t stop watching. We&#x27;re all waiting for something: an implosion, an explosion on the field, a rapper on the sideline, two of the best players in college football, or the Deion reaction cam and postgame presser bait. Most importantly, we&#x27;re watching to see if they win or if they lose.
