                              <span>Six episodes in, Industry Season 3 is rounding into the homestretch, and as a result, there&#x27;s a lot going on. Too much to catalogue here. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t try. It&#x27;s time to check back in on our beloved characters and bask in their various manias and journeys into delirium.
Harper Stern: Going Down As She Goes Up! Over the last three weeks, we&#x27;ve gotten the full Harper experience. Particularly on the most recent episode, where she is twisted by the arm to go along with using her only friend to pull a fast one on Pierpoint. Harper becoming the monster she was always born to be is a consistent theme of the series. Her revenge against Pierpoint, and specifically Eric, has been inevitable since the end of the second season. And both of her confrontations to end the episode, first with Eric, and then with Yasmin (more on that later), were excruciating to watch. It&#x27;s hard to say she doesn&#x27;t deserve it, but nobody on this show deserves anything good. They are soulless husks, obsessed with money and the power/exaltation of the sell above their own humanity. Nevertheless, Harper makes her big bet and for the time being it looks good, and that&#x27;s what these people live for, at the expense of whatever personal relationships they claim to want.</span>

                              <span>A good indicator that a friend group won’t and maybe shouldn’t stay together is when they have divided themselves into “saints” and “sinners.” That is, however, an excellent pitch for a reality television show, which is perhaps part of how we ended up with The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, which premiered on Hulu on September 6. The show follows eight women who are part of a weird TikTok group they call MomTok, which is basically just them posting videos of themselves dancing in different configurations and maybe also proselytizing? 
The three of us have been messaging constantly about the Mormon Mommies. Their hair is so strange. They are always driving in the car. They are so mild for a reality television show, and yet it is that mildness that perhaps makes them so difficult to turn off. It is less like watching any of the Real Housewives franchises than it is like watching a middle school sleepover without any parents around.</span>

As I watched Hirschi race his first Tour de France in 2020 with a remarkable combination of enthusiasm, idiosyncrasy, and occasional brilliance, I thought I was watching the nascent form of someone sure to develop into not only one of the best but the most exciting riders in all of men&#x27;s road cycling. As he immediately backed that stage win up with a win at La Flèche Wallonne and ascended the podium at Worlds and Liège–Bastogne–Liège, I wondered if he wasn&#x27;t already there. As he parlayed his breakout 2020 into a huge contract with UAE, then spent the following three years more or less invisible, I scarcely thought of him at all.</span>

The suit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleges that Boston-based DraftKings and the UK-headquartered Bet365 used ballplayers’ images without permission while promoting gambling offerings. According to the complaint, both companies inappropriately appropriated “nearly every active MLB player’s image” for their websites and social media accounts, “including in posts encouraging customers to place bets on the featured player.”</span>

In that vein, C-SPAN host John McArdle interviewed constitutional scholar Jeffrey Rosen this morning, starting off the conversation with thoughtful observations on the danger political violence poses to a self-governing people.
Likewise, a White House proclamation notes that since 1952, Congress has designed this date as Constitution Day and Citizenship Day &quot;to honor the timeless principles&quot; enshrined in the nation&#x27;s founding document. This being an election...</span>

No reporter asked press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre whether President Joe Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris plan to visit the town that has come to represent what happens when a Midwest manufacturing city of 58,000 absorbs the arrival of some 20,000 migrants.

During last week&#x27;s debate, former president Donald Trump said Harris &quot;wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.&quot;
Her allies reacted with shock at Trump&#x27;s accusation.
Rep. Jamaal Bowman, (D-N.Y.), quoted Trump&#x27;s line and then wrote, &quot;Yall serious right now? He says anything. He just put words together that scares people and barely forms sentences.&quot;

Cops cut off entire avenues to traffic. Soon a phalanx of police vehicles, followed by a column of identical black SUVs, whooshed past red lights.
They were taking former president Donald Trump to his home at Trump Tower. The New York Police Department was clearly determined not to let anything happen to him on their watch, certainly not after a young man of no obvious political persuasion nearly killed him in Butler, Pennsylvania.

&quot;In 2001, young men and women had similar political ideologies. ... Then, around 2016, something shifted, a new analysis shows.

With two minutes left in the fourth quarter of Sunday&#x27;s game against the visiting Connecticut Sun, Wilson popped out to the perimeter to receive an entry pass from Jackie Young. Despite intense pressure from Brionna Jones, Wilson corralled the pass, took two hard dribbles toward the elbow with her off hand, and pulled up to cash the 11-foot leaning jumper right before DeWanna Bonner&#x27;s help from the strong side could alter the shot.

In those 55 years, Nottingham Forest had not beaten Liverpool at Anfield: 29 matches, seven draws, and 22 losses, across the Premier League, FA Cup, and League Cup. Forest had been out of the Premier League since 1999, but since its return in 2022, the futility in Merseyside had continued, with two losses in two tries.

                              <span>At the most basic level, there is just no percentage in trying to parse a political campaign&#x27;s decision to try to incite a pogrom. It does a favor to the people doing it, for one thing, because even assessing it along the lines of any other campaign decision provides a cosmetic coat of reason to something that hasn&#x27;t earned it. More than that, there&#x27;s no sense in searching for a justification when the people involved know that they are doing something that can&#x27;t be justified. That is more or less why they&#x27;re doing it, and any supposed tactical advantage should be understood as secondary to the primary purpose, which is to see what they can get away with, and to begin seeking permission in earnest for something that is (probably) still impermissible.

                              <span>In addition to running the pig skin the main job of an NFL analyst is scouting. For me that means watching &quot;NFL&quot; Hard Knocks, a show that goes inside the mind of the competition. This year &quot;NFL&quot; Hard Knocks had a whole season about some guys at the New York Giants who sit around in their unremarkable offices and look at computers with lists of players on them. First of all: Don&#x27;t care. Second of all: Hey, where did you buy those office decorations—Office Depot? Is this a glamorous professional football operation, or a paper company based in Scranton, Pennsylvania? 
Let me tell you how I would decorate my office if I were to become the Head of Player Personnel for the Jacksonville Jaguar organization, something that many suspect is a distinct possibility. I would have a big office and in the corner is an ordinary-looking water fountain. When someone came in for a meeting I&#x27;d say, &quot;Have a drink from my water fountain. Oh, but it&#x27;s not water in there—it&#x27;s Red Bull.&quot; I would have a water fountain installed in my office that shoots out Red Bull instead of water. That would raise a few eyebrows, I bet.</span>

                              <span>More often than not, an NFL coach&#x27;s job security is tied to how his quarterback performs. This being the case, it&#x27;s rare to see a coach speak publicly about his starting quarterback in anything but encouraging terms. The most incapable bozo in the league can go out there and throw three picks, and his coach will still say stuff like It&#x27;s not one person who wins or loses a game, or We believe [incapable bozo] is still the right guy to lead this football team. This is because most coaches know that publicly undermining an already-bad quarterback will only make things worse for himself.
So it&#x27;s meaningful when a head coach, just two weeks into his tenure, has this to say about a play made by his signal-caller:</span>

                              <span>The final score tells lies, at least by omission. 21-18 implies a normal football game, and not a single point in the Commanders&#x27; win over the Giants was scored without some accompanying angst or absurdity. There is a very normal way to get to 21 points, and it involves touchdowns, and Washington scored zero of those. There are several normal-ish ways to score 18 points, and all the ones you can probably think of include field goals, and the Giants had none of those because they didn&#x27;t have a kicker. Just another Sunday afternoon for two very silly teams.
It was not exactly &quot;bad&quot; football, though both teams are generally very bad. It was farcical, and perversely entertaining, and maybe antifootball, but the players all performed competently. Do you know how NFL rules contain a few obscure, vestigial rules from the game&#x27;s messy origins, rules that feel like they come out of a different sport altogether, because they do? On Sunday it was almost as if the Commanders and Giants were playing two entirely separate parallel universes&#x27; versions of football, one where touchdowns were never invented and one where placekicking is forbidden, and the clash of styles actually made for some pretty good drama. These two teams and their fans will take competitiveness wherever they can find it, I suppose.</span>

                              <span>In Week 1, Caleb Williams and his rebooted Chicago Bears did something that nobody had seen since David Carr and the 2002 Houston Texans. And it was something good! No rookie QB picked No. 1 overall in the past two decades had managed to start and win his team&#x27;s opener, though Williams&#x27;s success came in large part thanks to his defense and special teams. In the 24-17 comeback victory, nine points came from field goals, while the two touchdowns arrived courtesy of a blocked punt and this gift of an underhanded pick-six from a falling Will Levis. The No. 1 overall pick&#x27;s stat line suffered from a distinct lack of pizazz—93 yards on 29 passes, 15 more on the ground—but a win was a win, and after an 0-4 start to the season last year, 1-0 felt pretty good for Chicago.
On Sunday night, however, Williams turned in a much more traditional tribute to David Carr&#x27;s legacy, getting sacked a bunch of times in a loss in Houston. This was a tight game but not a pretty one—19-13 was the final, with only six total points scored in the second half—and as the Texans boosted themselves to 2-0 primarily off kicker Ka&#x27;imi Fairbairn&#x27;s big beefy leg, they illuminated the uphill battle the Bears still face with the developing Williams at the helm.</span>

Except for one team, with a used quarterback, an aging running back, a recycled coach with a specialty in defense, a modest list of weapons, and a sad gray pedigree. That team has scored 11 touchdowns in two games, punted just three times, beaten the face masks off the NFL&#x27;s answer to the Chicago White Sox, and then defeated the most hyped team in the last half-century of American professional sports.</span>

                              <span>Gerrit Cole is, by many people&#x27;s standards, not likable. I find this way of thinking to be incorrect because I like Gerrit Cole, though in a way that&#x27;s not always contingent on his continued success. He&#x27;s a guy with a dad comportment who is very invested in labor and the MLB Players Association. He&#x27;s one of the best pitchers of his generation. He is often one of the most informative pitchers to listen to talk after a start, especially a poor one. He sounds a bit like Kermit the Frog? His 2021 spider tack era proved so fascinating to me that I got in the graph mines for my own satisfaction.
This is not to say that I don&#x27;t derive joy from his successful starts, it&#x27;s just that it is not the only part of what defines a satisfying Cole game. To me, he remains narratively interesting as a hyper-competitive guy who has gone through ups and downs in recent years. It&#x27;s hard to begrudge anyone their disaffection—he can be a bit of a heel on the field, but he&#x27;s a well-constructed one who&#x27;s generally chill off of it, and, most importantly, has a fatal flaw: Rafael Devers.</span>

                              <span>If Lando Norris wanted a defense for his pole-to-win conversion rate in 2024, he can point to Charles Leclerc. Leclerc has gotten every single pole at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix since 2021, including this year&#x27;s, and has converted none of them. Baku was Leclerc&#x27;s race to lose on Sunday, and lose it he did, though not through the traditional Ferrari methodology of engine explosions, egregious strategy calls, or things of that nature. The race was a war of attrition that was, somehow, still won by the first pit stop.
But for all the pre-race chitter chatter about McLaren favoring Norris in team orders, a disastrous qualifying performance meant that Norris&#x27;s chances at a win were infinitesimally low. Instead, it was his teammate, Oscar Piastri, who started P2. Leclerc pulled off the line cleanly, and quickly built a six-second gap to Piastri. But with the medium tires degrading quickly, the undercut became extremely powerful. Sergio Pérez—who, in spite of a horrible 2024, could be a zombie and still get a podium finish at Baku—was the earliest frontrunner to pit. He came out just behind Norris, who started P15 and was accordingly running a different strategy.</span>

After all, it&#x27;s been three days now and the only people in Punditostan who haven&#x27;t urged him to retire are doing either gambling shows, fantasy shows, or both in one. Since those shows do not recognize players as humans, their disinterest is understandable.
But this was the first time for the Sunday morning auctioneers without portfolios to get their crack at diagnosing Tagovailoa&#x27;s latest concussion, and the general consensus remains as it was on Friday morning—that Tua should vote for his own brainpan. This is unusual given that most studio faces tend to err on the side of &quot;I played without half my head one time and had 17 tackles and threw for 367 yards and five scores,&quot; but nobody gets to work the pregame desk by saying, &quot;I think we should wait for the neurologists to see him.&quot; The take must be immediate, forceful, and deniable when incorrect.</span>

As the Republican presidential nominee walked the course, the suspect hid in shrubbery just 300-500 yards away when the Secret Service agent opened fire, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. The suspect carried two backpacks as well as a GoPro camera. His rifle had a scope.
