I saw Potter as a special kind of real-world doom—a man so powerful you cannot fight against him, only beg him for mercy, as George’s father had done before him and as his children almost certainly will after.

                              <span>It’s easy to hate Blake Lively. She&#x27;s beautiful. She&#x27;s tall. Her hair is so lush. Her skin is so smooth. She&#x27;s married to a damn Marvel actor, and they have beautiful children. Her best friend is Taylor Swift. In a world of demure, close-lipped smirks, Lively has a megawatt full-teeth smile. She was born in Los Angeles and raised by a talent scout and an actor. She was a cheerleader in high school. Relative to a celebrity like Jennifer Lawrence, Lively does not seem particularly approachable or down-to-earth; she seems much more like a goddess sent to give you body dysmorphia. She&#x27;s the popular girl, and always has been. But those are all reasons based in envy.
Then, of course, there are the real reasons to hate her. Lively has been in the spotlight since Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants premiered in 2005, almost two decades ago. That&#x27;s a lifetime in Hollywood, and plenty of time to make mistakes that everyone can see. And Lively&#x27;s actual mistakes have been bad ones. In 2012, she married Ryan Reynolds on a plantation in South Carolina, a decision she apologized for eight years later in 2020. This was, somehow, not a one-off; in 2014, Lively launched a (very short-lived) online lifestyle magazine called Preserve, which included a spread titled “Allure of Antebellum.” As Kara Brown wrote for Jezebel at the time, “Anyone who romanticizes our nation&#x27;s Antebellum period as some sort of marker of style and taste is definitely white and probably an asshole.”</span>

                              <span>This is the time of year when the best, biggest, and most ambitious movies come out. Not Oscar season, but rather that stretch when the halls of streaming services are decked with the brightly lit, thinly disguised advertisements that are the year&#x27;s new Christmas movies. There are more than 100 new Christmas films to watch this holiday season, and whether that number horrifies or excites you depends upon how much of a freak you are for the festive. Sabrina is proud to say they are a real Christmas freak, and this year they asked some of their colleagues to watch some of the most, uh, available new holiday movies. The final movie in our lineup is The Merry Gentlemen, Netflix&#x27;s answer to the longstanding question: How will Chad Michael Murray withstand the ravages of time?
Sabrina: Well, well, well. It’s come to this: the finale of Defector Watches A Christmas Movie. Thank you both for experiencing this movie with me, and thank you Justin for shepherding this series. Let’s get right to it: This movie operates on the premise that a big-city girl must help save her parent’s local small-town nightclub. Did your hometowns have a local nightclub? Did you ever go there, and would you consider it worth saving?</span>

                              <span>Rachelle Hampton: Can I just say I’m so honored to be taking part in my very first DRAB? This was one of the series I was most jealous of before I joined Defector because it seemed so fun. That maybe makes it even funnier that the very first book I suggested (and the one we ended up choosing) is the biggest bummer DRAB has ever seen.
I first came across Young Men And Fire in a McNally Jackson earlier this year; I remember my attention being caught by the promise of an in-depth look at the Smokejumpers, who I’d been sort of lowkey obsessed with since reading Nora Roberts’ Chasing Fire. I’d never heard of the Mann Gulch fire or Norman Maclean really, though I realized after we picked this book that he also wrote A River Runs Through It, which I’ve seen the movie adaptation of. All to say, I was pretty stoked when y’all agreed to read it. What piqued y’alls interest?</span>

                              <span>Let&#x27;s start with a flaw. Liverpool&#x27;s defense is still the best in the Premier League, having allowed 13 goals in 15 matches entering Sunday&#x27;s trip to North London for a match against often-feisty but currently-shambolic Tottenham Hotspur. Virgil van Dijk is back to world-beating form, and his various partners in the center—often Ibrahima Konaté, though not for the past two months, thanks to a knee injury—have been competent enough to lead the league in goals against. However, there have been some cracks showing, and Liverpool&#x27;s two previous league matches saw that dominant defense give up five combined goals to Newcastle and Fulham.
Both of those matches ended in draws, only the third and fourth blemishes in Liverpool&#x27;s league season so far, and though it is unfair to put the entirety of the blame on the defense, it certainly didn&#x27;t help. And so, if one were to look at just how many goals Liverpool gave up on Sunday against Tottenham, it would read like another bad day at the office for van Dijk and co. Thankfully, soccer is played in both directions, and Tottenham&#x27;s three goals on its home ground only felt like feeble attempts at holding off the siege that was Liverpool&#x27;s high-line-abusing attack, which scored six goals but probably could have scored 10.</span>

                              <span>Tyson Fury once broke an opponent’s spirit with a story. He was set to fight Wladimir Klitschko, who’d been in possession of at least one major heavyweight belt for a full decade, looking near invincible throughout his run. Few expected Fury to do much before getting knocked out. Then, in a sit-down face-off, Fury recounted a tale of a long-ago training camp in which he outlasted Klitschko in a sauna, making it out to be a battle of wills. Just before Fury revealed that Klitschko departed the hot box first, Wlad gulped like somebody was holding him at gunpoint. Fury was equally effective in the ring, so bamboozling Klitschko with feints and twitches that the longtime champion seemingly forgot to throw punches. Fury won, then rubbed a tub of salt into the wound by serenading his wife with a harrowing version of Aerosmith’s “I Don’t Want To Miss a Thing.” Klitschko stood feet away, perhaps daydreaming of new career paths and better singers.
Fury figured never to meet an opponent he couldn’t out-talk. He approached the brash knockout artist Deontay Wilder with a furious torrent of psychological warfare, then knocked him out twice in their trilogy. He surely has said the word “dosser” more than any other boxer, or Earth resident. He could be at turns nasty, earnest, bigoted, kind, or silent, but he inevitably snuck into his foes’ heads and mangled their brains before he even started punching them.</span>

                              <span>Such is the strength of the hellish vortex Manchester City is presently trapped in—Saturday&#x27;s loss at Aston Villa gives the Mancs just one win from their last 12—that you almost have to start taking performances against them with a pinch of salt. City has shat the bed so regularly, keeping just one clean sheet over this stretch of misery, that it&#x27;s risky to read too much into what otherwise might appear to be a statement win against the Citizens. For proof of this notion, look no further than Tottenham.
With that in mind, when you look at the scoresheet from that 2-1 Villa win and see Jhon Durán&#x27;s name there, you may be tempted to discount what the goal says about the forward&#x27;s talent. This would be a mistake, because Durán is scoring all the time, against everyone.</span>

                              <span>The College Football Playoff is a wild hit so far, in that everyone hates it. Notre Dame beat Indiana Friday in a spectacular nothingburger that turned out to be the closest game of the weekend, and the three Saturday games were the competitive equivalent of Week 2 bodybag games decided by an aggregate score of 118-51. Even the gambling conglomerates were screaming and flipping off their gigantic monitors.

                              <span>Arrogance is that most remarkable of pejoratives because it wears Janus&#x27;s mask—a bad thing in normal society but an absolute requirement in all the arts. It is never enough to have the gift; one must strut it as well. There&#x27;s way more money in being the guest of honor and the DJ simultaneously, even if the self-promotional moves are now boilerplate behavior for those who have to pimp their own ride.
Which is why, in the end, Rickey Henderson, who died Friday at 65 years old, was not merely arrogant and justifiably so, but the next step beyond merely arrogant. He had the gift, but he also knew that he didn&#x27;t need to sell himself except to himself, because (a) he was his own best audience, as great performers tend to be, and (b) he figured that eventually everyone else would have to see it his way. And in this case, he was right.</span>
