                              <span>Round up a little, and Diego Pavia might well be six feet tall, his generously listed height. Before he transferred to Vanderbilt, he played at New Mexico State, and before that at the New Mexico Military Institute, where he committed out of high school as a two-star recruit. If there was any hint of what was to come, of the wild self-belief required to lead an upset of the No. 1 team in the country, it was that Pavia arrived in Nashville with a suspiciously rich lore. See: the no-look pass he once threw because his helmet was on completely backwards; the in-state rivalry taken so far it ended with an Albuquerque Journal story headlined “NMSU coach ‘disappointed’ in Diego Pavia after urination video”; the wrestling move he once tried on an Auburn defensive back, the only time I can remember a quarterback being called for unnecessary roughness. In that context and perhaps only in that context, Saturday’s Alabama-Vanderbilt game, a 40-35 Vandy win and maybe the biggest upset in SEC history, makes perfect sense. 
Pavia had plenty of things to say after the win; unfortunately for the SEC Network standards and practices department, about 40 percent of it would need to be bleeped out later. (“Vandy, we’re fucking turnt!” he shouted into the mic, moments after explaining that God had given him a vision of this as a little kid.) In the stadium postgame, Vanderbilt looped a quote from Nick Saban over the PA. Two weeks ago on the Pat McAfee show, the former Alabama coach said, “The only place you play in the SEC that’s not hard to play is Vanderbilt.”</span>

                              <span>The moment at which an astute but otherwise objective observer might have begun getting suspicious about whether something might be going on with the New York Mets would probably have been late June. This was when it came out that the team had adopted as a clubhouse anthem the song that a reserve infielder had recorded in his home studio about being grateful and having a nice time. I can only guess at that perspective in this case, but take your own fan investments out of it and run this exercise through yourself. 
If you learned that, after wins, the baseball team you cared about was shouting along to the chorus of a song that the resident thirtysomething utility spork had recorded in his spare time—it could be Kevin Newman or Donovan Solano or whoever you like, in whatever genre you find most amusing to imagine—there would be in that news the sense that the good kind of weird thing was happening in that clubhouse. Any team that signed Jose Iglesias to a minor league deal, installed him as an everyday player out of necessity and watched him have the best season of his career at the age of 34, adopted his song, and then won nearly two out of every three games for four months would have some sense of destiny about it. It&#x27;s simply too stupid not to mean something. The challenge has been believing that this could happen, and then accepting that it was indeed happening, to the New York Mets.</span>

And we believe, too, that we can fit a chat about this topic into that format, because baseball is like a mall, in that baseball stadiums also have escalators.</span>

                              <span>Do you find yourself involuntarily salivating for Twin Snakes or Starmix? Are you standing tippy-toe for a handful of Sour Patch Watermelons? Is there a nonstop conveyer belt of tart treats going down your gullet? There is another way. I want to open a muscadine clinic for all the Haribo loyalists in the world. Nature&#x27;s gummy candy could fill the void as summer turns to fall.
The muscadine is a grape, but not the kind that populates fruit salads and Ziploc baggies. Those are mushy, easily yielding to the teeth, tossed into the mouth and eaten whole. Instead, the muscadine is an imposing orb that forces the eater to meditate upon its structure. Its skin might be a dull green with a purplish blush, or a wine-dark purple with a pinkish blush; it might have a dusty metallic sheen. It might be rough and speckled on the surface, a little leathery, and strangely taut. If that doesn&#x27;t sound like a pleasant bite of fruit, that&#x27;s fine—you won&#x27;t actually be eating that part. Think of the muscadine as an individually packaged treat.</span>

                              <span>It is fall, and along with football, sweaters, and pumpkin spice latte memes, this time of year is reserved for marathon film screenings at the New York Film Festival. It&#x27;s a pivotal period in which the best movies expected to arrive just before the year&#x27;s Oscar cutoff get an early screening. This year&#x27;s edition has amassed a roster of greatly hyped and neat surprise movies from all over the world. Some of these movies, like the sure-to-be-favorite of the extremely online Anora, the masterful Nickel Boys, Luca Guadagnino&#x27;s ambitious William S. Burroughs adaptation Queer, and David Cronenberg&#x27;s latest The Shrouds, deserve their own blogs as the wider public gets to see them. In the meantime, here are a collection of movies I enjoyed and wanted to say a little something about.

                              <span>David Foster Wallace had a thing for boredom. He had such a thing for it that he turned it into a kind of last legacy. According to a lengthy (and pretty great) piece in The New Yorker by D.T. Max published a year after Wallace died by suicide in 2008, he left behind a third of his final novel, The Pale King, for which he had spent countless hours researching boredom. A typed note he also left behind laid out the book’s central intention: “Bliss—a-second-by-second joy and gratitude at the gift of being alive, conscious—lies on the other side of crushing, crushing boredom. Pay close attention to the most tedious thing you can find (Tax Returns, Televised Golf) and, in waves, a boredom like you’ve never known will wash over you and just about kill you. Ride these out, and it’s like stepping from black and white into color. Like water after days in the desert. Instant bliss in every atom.” 
This interest of Wallace’s has been closely connected to mindfulness, but the two things are a little different. Mindfulness is an awareness of things as they come, it is a kind of riding out, but that’s not exactly bliss you find through it so much as a kind of acceptance—which, to a person in constant distress, can no doubt, relatively speaking, feel like bliss. “Pay close attention to the most tedious thing you can find.” I didn’t realize this would be Joker: Folie à Deux.</span>

                              <span>On July 8, an all-star team from the Northwest Washington Little League (NWLL) faced off against Mamie Johnson Little League to open the D.C. city championship tournament, the first round in the global annual tournament for ballplayers 12 years old and under that ends with the Little League World Series. The game came to a halt in the middle of the sixth and final inning, when the NWLL first baseman picked up the game ball on his way to his position, prompting the home plate umpire to loudly declare that the first baseman now had to pitch. With NWLL up 6-0 and three outs away from advancing, manager Mike Klisch walked onto the field and spent several minutes conferring with the umpire. The first baseman had already pitched the first four innings before being relieved, so he was likely ineligible to return to the mound. It took a phone call from the ump to Little League headquarters to untangle the rules. 
“Is there a 24-hour line to answer questions about rules?” an NWLL mother in the crowd asked as the game resumed.</span>

                              <span>On the morning that our former GMG buddy and current bestselling author Jason Schreier joined us to record this week&#x27;s Distraction, our producer Eric noted that his podcast feed featured three other shows on which Jason was a guest. While Jason&#x27;s new book—it&#x27;s called Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, And Future Of Blizzard Entertainment, and comes out next week—will in some sense sell itself due to Schreier&#x27;s status as a titan in his field and Blizzard&#x27;s massive following, in another and more literal sense the guy still has to go out there and sell it. All we could do was our part to help, which in this case was talk about the current New York Jets and our varied experiences of the Keith Van Horn Administration with the New Jersey Nets for 12 minutes before turning to Jason&#x27;s (fascinating) book.</span>

                              <span>How fast the mighty fall, and timely, too. The Houston Astros&#x27; seven-year streak of reaching the ALCS ended the same night that the Atlanta Braves&#x27; six-year streak of reaching the NLDS did the same, and each in an unceremonious sweep—at least, as much as a sweep can be a sweep in a three-game postseason series. At the very least, the Milwaukee Brewers spared us an extra day without any postseason baseball by forcing a Game 3 against the Mets.
No sensible person will cry about these developments. The Astros are the Astros, and the Braves were a dead team walking even entering the playoffs; better they just be put out of their misery. Other than the overarching sentiment towards both teams&#x27; failings, conflating them is a bit misleading. The postseason record that the Astros strung together might be distasteful, but has to garner some level of respect: No other team has managed it. Meanwhile, &quot;reaching the NLDS&quot; can sound impressive when phrased that way, but even in the expanded playoffs, half the teams that reach a Divisional Series do it through the regular season.</span>

                              <span>What&#x27;s the absolute best kind of hit? A grand slam, you might say. I suppose, yeah, objectively, that&#x27;s right. But after Andy Ibáñez knocked a bases-loaded double into the left corner pocket in the eighth inning of a tied Tigers-Astros game on Wednesday, Tigers fans might disagree. With the bases-clearing two-bagger, they received beat after beat of great news: the suspenseful declaration that the ball was fair, and then the dramatic build of an incrementally larger lead. &quot;One run scores! ... Two runs score! ... Evvvvvverybody scores!&quot; It was as good as it gets, and so was the rest of the afternoon for the Detroiters, as Houston went 1-2-3, 1-2-3 to eject themselves from the postseason barely 24 hours after it began.

                              <span>Here we are again. For most of Erik ten Hag&#x27;s tenure at Manchester United, England&#x27;s most storied club has been reeling. Though his first season, the 2022-23 edition, was a moderate success—third place in the Premier League and a League Cup trophy, after a 2021-22 season in which the club finished sixth with no trophies—it&#x27;s been downhill since. Instead of building on that return to decency, last season United finished eighth in the league and last in its Champions League group, looking dire for most of the campaign.
The Dutch manager was almost immediately on the hot seat last season, losing four out of seven matches in the first six weeks, and it didn&#x27;t get much better as the season went on. A 4-0 loss to Crystal Palace in early May seemed to signal the end of his time at Old Trafford, but a shock FA Cup final victory over Manchester City bought him enough of a reprieve to try again this season. A spendy summer followed that victory, and if not a return to title contention, the United faithful and brass probably expected a solid push for the top four. If the first six weeks of this season are to be believed, however, they&#x27;re in for more of the same, which has to have put Ten Hag on the brink of the unemployment line.</span>

                              <span>The year is 1979. The Phillies are playing the Reds. Pete Rose tries to steal second, and the throw arrives late. The ump signals safe, and instead of arguing the call Cincinnati second baseman Joe Morgan just says: “It’s Pete Rose of the Philadelphia Phillies!” Never mind that Morgan and Rose were teammates for six years on the Reds. Never mind that Rose would’ve been announced earlier as part of the starting lineup, or that he would’ve made it to first base in some way before taking second. It&#x27;s a commercial, so you have to cut it some slack.
Still, it stands to reason that Joe Morgan would not be particularly shocked to see Rose at second. But he also wasn’t paying all that close attention if he only noticed Rose when the two were right next to each other. The scenario raises a lot of questions, but not necessarily the one that Morgan asks: “And what kind of aftershave you using?”</span>

These past 8 weeks may have flown by, but it also feels like we&#x27;ve just finished running a marathon and are in desperate need of an IV drip of fluids straight into the bloodstream. Season 3 of Industry was exhausting, operatic, and stuffed to the gills with action, plot, degradation, sex, and violence. And if the comments on these recaps are any indicator, it has also been a divisive season, with people torn on its pacing, its ratcheted-up storylines episode to episode, and its sensory overload, which undermined the impact of its most catastrophic and exhilarating moments. Season 3 was not interested in patience, letting things breathe, or drawing things out. That worked both to and against the show&#x27;s …</span>

If Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen’s brand, The Row, has permeated the imaginations of ordinary people who can’t afford $1,000 sandals, it may be because it’s become synonymous with the abysmal internet brainrot trend “quiet luxury,” a backlash to the labelmania that defined much of 2010s fashion, and perhaps an encapsulation of increasing class consciousness in the years coming out of the pandemic.</span>

If Borussia Dortmund is famous for something else, it is for being Europe&#x27;s premier finishing school for young talents destined for bigger and better salaries and transfer fees upon graduation. Here&#x27;s a short list of players who have passed through Dortmund in the last 15 years or so, in no particular order: Robert Lewandowski, Ousmane Dembélé, Jadon Sancho, Ilkay Gündogan, Mario Götze, Christian Pulisic, Jude Bellingham, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Erling Haaland, Mats Hummels ... Ok, maybe the list isn&#x27;t so short, and not all of those players starred upon leaving Dortmund. However, the impressive history of talent detection and refinement is there, and that list is about to get a little bit longer, now that Karim Adeyemi appears to be hitting a new level of excellence.

                              <span>My first pets were a pair of hamsters, sisters from the same litter. I was surprised that such tiny little brains could hold such distinct personalities: Harley, golden and white, was more athletic, more aloof, notably smarter, happy to play by herself; Yankee, a chubby cream-colored meatball, craved human touch—she&#x27;d run to the door at the top of her cage and stare up, unable to see much with a hamster&#x27;s terrible eyesight but secure in the knowledge that I&#x27;d soon come to scoop her up. All she wanted was to be held and petted. She was the biggest little sweetie on god&#x27;s green Earth. The sisters got along grandly in their shared, three-tiered cage. And then one day out of nowhere, and for reasons I never understood and I suspect they didn&#x27;t either, Yankee starting beating the shit out of Harley every time they&#x27;d cross paths—biting her, scratching her, screaming with fury at the mere sight of her previously beloved sister. We separated them, giving each their own cage, and they each lived out their long happy hamster lives in solitary. But it was a good lesson for young me. No matter how fuzzy or friend-shaped, creatures are not simply furry people and can&#x27;t be viewed or treated as such. Animals are animals.
Grizzly bears, despite looking an awful lot like thousand-pound hamsters, are ur-predators. They are secretive, unknowable, capable of tremendous acts of strength and violence. Our ancestors knew this: The word &quot;bear&quot; was originally a euphemism, invented by our Germanic-speaking predecessors afraid to use the animal&#x27;s true name, made taboo out of a superstitious fear that speaking it would cause them to meet one. Our Enlightenment-era men of science were no less intimidated—it was designated Ursus arctos horribilis for a reason. This week in Alaska, nature provided a morbid and useful reminder that bears are bears, with all that entails.</span>

                              <span>The Atlanta Braves will play their second elimination game in three days Wednesday afternoon, when Max Fried leads them against Joe Musgrove of the San Diego Padres in Game 2 of their National League Wild Card series. With all due respect to Atlanta&#x27;s handful of healthy players, the Braves are not wanted here! Four of their, what, six best players are out; the team only nosed into the Wild Card at all because of a preposterous first-in-history gap-day doubleheader, where everyone knew going in that both teams could advance with a split. It&#x27;s hard to imagine a less legitimate playoff berth than one earned in the second of these two games, after your opponent has already lost all motivation.
It&#x27;s clear that God has seen enough of the Braves. Three road teams won on Tuesday, including the even more road weary New York Mets, who haven&#x27;t played a game at home since Sept. 22 and who failed America by going hangover mode in Monday&#x27;s late game and allowing Atlanta to shamble onwards. The Braves, meanwhile, advanced one single runner to third base in nine innings Tuesday night, struck out 15 times, and were ruthlessly blanked by playoff debutante Michael King and a pair of Padres relievers. For lack of anything even vaguely resembling a suitable alternative, Atlanta manager Brian Snitker handed the ball to A.J. Smith-Shawver, a 21-year-old prospect with fewer than 30 total innings of work in the majors, who threw 87 pitches for the big club this year, all of them back on May 23. Smith-Shawver watched his team squander a first-inning scoring opportunity, then took the mound in a Braves uniform for just the second time in 2024. Seven pitches later, this happened:</span>
