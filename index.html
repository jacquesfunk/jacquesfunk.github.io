Paxton credited a challenging drama teacher at his Fort Worth high school for part of this, and the rest—the rest of the story, and a film career that unfolded over four decades, until Paxton&#x27;s death at 61 in 2017—was a matter of chasing his urge to make something with his friends. Before he went to Hollywood, Paxton shot movies on Super 8 film with similarly film-obsessed Texas friends he met while studying abroad in England after high school. &quot;We made films because we liked to blow stuff up,&quot; Paxton told Texas Monthly in 1997.
At the time, he was promoting Traveller, the first movie Paxton had produced after what was already a long career that began with his father finding him work as a set-dresser on Encyclopaedia Britannica educational films, Paxton finding his way into the orbit of exploitation film maestro Roger Corman, and parlaying his jittery charisma into gradually bigger roles. By 1997, Paxton had already spent more than a decade poised somewhere between character actor and star. The friends with whom Paxton had snuck around railroad tracks and movie theaters two decades earlier had credits on Traveller, too.</span>

                              <span>Billie Marten&#x27;s new record, Dog Eared, is a pretty major departure from her prior output. We do not hear a solo, cleanly produced acoustic guitar at any point on it. Our girl got an electric axe, a chorus pedal, a few more people, and did not look back. And I&#x27;m not judging! It&#x27;s delightful. The record has the sound that tumbling down a flight of stairs in a Dr. Seuss book might have. It wants to maximize the whimsy found in its sadness, which requires a rather particular mindset. While the sound is quite different, Marten&#x27;s writing typically conveys a loneliness that can rend your soul. Some people make music for being in bed with someone else. She makes music for being in bed all by yourself.
Back to me. The woman who introduced me to Billie Marten some years back did so while we were theoretically sharing a bed, though in hindsight I think I may have just been a way to get out of the house for her. She was living with her ex-boyfriend and his parents, but claimed to have seen the light and realized she was a lesbian. She told me (unprompted) that she wasn&#x27;t ready to start a new relationship until she moved out of the house of the old one. Then she hit me up out of the blue a few months down the line to alert me that she was now dating another man. I wish I could say that shit like this still fucked me up, but it doesn&#x27;t really—not because I think being used to this sort of thing is bad or a sign of the times, but just because I really enjoy getting in my feelings every now and again.</span>

                              <span>Perhaps the highest praise I can offer a book that took 27 years to complete and runs over 1,000 pages is that I can see why, and that it doesn’t feel like it. Sam Tanenhaus’s extremely long and anxiously awaited biography of the man who founded National Review, and is often regarded as the architect of modern American conservatism, arrived with a resounding thud on my doorstep. There is no way that a book the size of Buckley: The Life and The Revolution that Changed America could arrive quietly. It is, in many ways, a remarkable accomplishment: exhaustive but not tiring, serious yet lively, both affectionate and suspicious. It is almost dizzyingly populated with recognizable characters—the result of Buckley’s famed and enormous social influence—which offers regular satisfaction both to readers who like knowing what Sylvia Plath thought of the Buckley family home, and ones who yearn to learn more about cranky Viennese ex-Leninists. Most of all, Buckley is very clearly the result of slow thinking and methodical research, which makes it precisely the sort of work that its subject could never produce. 
William F. Buckley Jr. went for quantity instead. He wrote dozens of books, including non-fiction and a bestselling series of spy novels, both of which were mainly dashed off while on skiing vacations in Gstaad. He also produced three columns a week for decades, generated prodigious written correspondence, and appeared in 1,504 episodes of Firing Line, all while editing the magazine and accepting regular speaking gigs. For years, Buckley promised to write a serious work of political theory—he managed to produce thousands of words railing against his liberal enemies, but was ultimately thwarted by his inability to offer a coherent elaboration of what conservatives were really about.</span>

But seasonal shift or no, Cork vs. Tipperary promises to be a supernova of a tilt, and the toughest ticket in town, notwithstanding the upcoming concerts from the reunited Manchester band, led by Liam and Noel Gallagher. This is a mashup of historic hurling powerhouses.</span>

                              <span>After a month of controversy, Lloyd Howell Jr. resigned from his post as the NFL Players Association executive director on Thursday night, effective immediately. “It’s clear that my leadership has become a distraction to the important work the NFLPA advances every day,” Howell wrote in a statement announcing his decision. “I hope this will allow the NFLPA to maintain its focus on its player members ahead of the upcoming season.”

                              <span>Bill Belichick, aging boyfriend to emerging media mogul Jordon Hudson, will be the subject of an upcoming Hulu docuseries, per reporting by Front Office Sports.
Back in March, HBO, NFL Films, and the University of North Carolina were working out a deal to make Belichick&#x27;s Tar Heels football team the focus of a season of the Hard Knocks series. That deal reportedly fell through very late in the process, with Belichick insisting, unconvincingly, that there was never much mutual interest. &quot;The Hard Knocks thing, you know, like, just for the record, Hard Knocks is training camp,” Belichick told The Pivot Podcast, in May. “And we’re not training camp. We’re just not. That’s not what we are. You know, the drama of training camp, the who’s gonna cut and all that. Like, we’re a season, and they don’t want that.&quot; The New York Times reported days later that NFL Films kiboshed the deal not over anything having to do with the inherent drama of training camp, but because Hudson—who at 24 years old is less than a third the age of her doddering old lover—demanded content approval and &quot;partial ownership of the show.&quot;</span>

                              <span>What I knew of the eccentric baseball owner Bill Veeck, I knew only from stray web searches at White Sox games. What was a shower stall doing on the concourse? What are those pinwheel things above the scoreboard? While the trainer came out to check on Yoan Moncada or the pitching coach asked Michael Kopech to throw strikes, the answers to these questions were easy to find, read, and forget. Usually the research never went much further; my curiosity is no match for bad ballpark WiFi and dwindling phone battery. And usually, Michael Kopech continued to not throw strikes.
Last summer, Veeck popped up on my phone again for a different reason. On a slow news day in Chicago, he was the subject of a heated sports talk radio rant: The just-hired White Sox play-by-play guy had mispronounced his name.</span>

                              <span>While watching the Euros quarterfinal between Sweden and England with an eye toward covering it, I kept changing my mind on what to write about. This is a side effect of my job and my brain, both of which combine to help me begin to see narratives as soccer matches burn through their allotted time. Some matches are straightforward in this way: One team controls the game and takes the win, and isn&#x27;t that just the most boring thing to write about? Others, though, rocket between extremes, making it almost impossible to pre-write, even in my mind, what I&#x27;m going to take away from a match. Those are fun, I enjoy the challenge. There is, however, a third kind of match, unique to knockout soccer, in which penalty kicks arrive and suddenly, everything I had thought over 120 minutes of play gets thrown out the window, and all you are left with is picking up the pieces of a shootout. Sweden-England was, unequivocally, that third type of match.

                              <span>I do not usually have a fear that my friends will change, in whatever facets they may. Change is just an inevitable, wonderful part of getting older. There is, however, one exception: I have recently developed a fear that my friend Will, whom I have known since middle school, will eventually become a Bill, and as such, I will have to refer to my friend Will as &quot;Bill.&quot; This fear has led me to realize that I don&#x27;t know much about the machinations of the William Nickname League.
My family only ever uses my English name in the third person, so any nicknames on Kathryn in my life have arisen out of some sort of contrivance with my friends. As a side effect, you can figure out when and how someone came to know me by how they refer to me. Will, like Kate or Joe, can be a given name but generally is a nickname—specifically a hypocoristic, a shortened form without a diminutive suffix (-ie or y or whatever). How does one become a Will from, presumably, William? (I think about names a normal amount.)</span>

He worked as an engineer for Boeing, yet harbored delusions of grandeur—first of being an astronaut despite not being a deranged military test pilot, and later, even more embarrassingly, of being a successful comedian. In 1986, he met John Keister after an open mic, which would lead to his first television role. Almost Live. Almost Live! was a Seattle-area sketch comedy show which would air either directly before or after SNL. It really can&#x27;t be overstated how big of a deal Almost Live! was in Seattle. You talk to anyone in the area over a certain age, and they have a favorite bit.
I&#x27;m a little too young to remember watching Almost Live! live, but I do still have a favorite. &quot;COPS in [Seattle neighborhood]&quot; was a recurring sketch lampooning the show COPS and Seattle, but it is also a near-perfect time capsule. Here is &quot;COPS in Wallingford,&quot; with Keister patrolling the neighborhood that neighbors the university and was the home of many of the town&#x27;s artsier types:</span>

The Kiwi rider from Red Bull has just summited the Hautacam, a winding, rolling, and, today, infernally hot Pyrenean climb that takes roughly 40 minutes. A better verb for what he did might be survived, as he finished 63rd, more than 31 minutes behind the winner, and he is currently stuffing his jersey full of ice. I ask him how old he is turning (23) and wish him a happy birthday. In response I receive the most venomous &quot;Thank you&quot; of my life.
&quot;Shit birthday&quot; is a great, punchy descriptor for 2025 Tour de France&#x27;s first climbing day: a party that drives you mad. The gathered thousands love it; the riders, not as much. As we&#x27;d threaded our way up the Hautacam amid clueless fans riding their bikes as if trying to get squished, children screamed at us and dirtbag French guys squirted water into my open window. My comrades and I are denied turns on a luge ride reserved for VIPs. Riders cross the finish line excreting and then gulping various salts and are swarmed by TV cameras. Jonas Vingegaard nearly runs me over seconds after finishing. Emmanuel Macron has flown to the top of the Hautacam in a helicopter.</span>

                              <span>At the beginning of every baseball career, everyone is pretty much guessing. From a certain perspective, the work of that career amounts to generating enough information—filling out the back of a baseball card, coloring in a Savant page, being transacted upon in the ways that baseball players are—that it can all be evaluated in the end. That is not my perspective, personally, but it is very much a purpose that baseball has served for some of those who are served in some way or another by caring about the game. A career is a career, it&#x27;s a life in the sport, but it is also both an accumulation of evidence and a story told all the way through to a conclusion. They all end, and a striking number of the illustrious ones end in the same way as the more prosaic ones, with one or two or three last thwarted tries to see if that&#x27;s really everything there was to find or know.
But at the beginning, no one knows very much at all. Teams drafting or signing amateur players do so based on information that, for all the ways in which the process has been smoothed and sharpened by technology over time, is necessarily incomplete. The statistics don&#x27;t really mean very much; potential Major Leaguers are sufficiently different from the people they play baseball against even in college that their statistics often wind up so outsized that they&#x27;re impossible to parse. This can be as true for a high school player who hits .575 against other teenagers who will never play another meaningful baseball game in their lives as it is for an SEC pitcher who gets drafted despite putting up an ERA in the mid-sevens. Teams, or anyway smarter and more ambitious teams, tune the numbers out, or just down. The other stuff is what matters.</span>

They want them released! They want Donald Trump in jail! They want to know what the hell is going on! Seriously, though, what the hell is going on?
As Defector&#x27;s chief file-explainer, I am here to once again tell you all you need to know about the latest files.</span>

                              <span>On Wednesday, the Phoenix Suns agreed to a buyout of Bradley Beal&#x27;s contract, ending a putrid era that amounted to very little. The team traded for Beal in the summer of 2023 to play alongside Kevin Durant, who was traded to Houston in June, and Devin Booker, the last one standing, having just signed an extension in Phoenix. Their skillsets were redundant, their chemistry depressing, and, despite their three salaries adding up to 107 percent of the salary cap in the 2024-25 season, they never won a single playoff game together.
Beal had reportedly been unhappy in Phoenix for a long time; since-fired coach Mike Budenholzer even yanked the guard out of the starting lineup for six weeks. But Beal&#x27;s contract had a no-trade clause, narrowing the Suns&#x27; options for offloading him. The solution: a gigantic buyout. Per The Athletic, Beal was owed $110.8 million over the remaining two years of his contract. He agreed to forgo $13.8 million of it, and will see the remaining $97 million stretched over the next five seasons. Beal&#x27;s agent Mark Bartelstein told ESPN that he took &quot;intense conversations&quot; to pull off the buyout; it&#x27;s worth remembering that he was negotiating against his son Josh, who is the CEO of the Suns.</span>

                              <span>There was a moment, near the end of my week-plus in Maine, when I could actually feel myself Becoming Normal again. The combination of relatively healthy activities, reduced screen-time, and a spike in omega-3 fatty acids due to increased seafood intake chipped some of the barnacles off my brain; detaching from the news cycle to some extent did the rest. I mention this not just to tell you how my vacation went, but because it was in listening to this episode that I realized how fleeting that moment truly was. We&#x27;re back.</span>

                              <span>There are only two pieces of media that have made me wistful for a small-town/suburban childhood I didn&#x27;t have: A Christmas Story, and Calvin And Hobbes. Before you accuse me of specifically longing for the tract housing of Ohio, if I interrogate this a little further it turns out that what I really wanted was a yard. Because I wanted to shoot a BB gun at imaginary bandits like Ralphie did, and, like Calvin, I wanted to build demented snowmen.
Bill Watterson knew, or at least captured better than anyone, the private derangement of the average 6-year-old boy. Imagination is one thing: Monsters lived under the bed, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, teachers were misshapen alien monsters in disguise, Tracer Bullet charges $50 per day plus expenses. But somewhere beyond those fairly standard fantasy worlds lies the grisly id of the artist, and the snow is his canvas.</span>

The flamingos were feeding, their long necks squiggled into the water and flat feet stomping in a kind of dance. Ortega Jiménez noticed the flamingo heads produced capillary waves, concentric ripples on the water&#x27;s surface. &quot;What is happening inside of the water?&quot; he wondered.</span>

                              <span>For Bill Guerin, who&#x27;s been GM of the Minnesota Wild since 2019, the beginning of this month must have felt like finally taking off an extremely tight pair of pants after a very long day. As a consequence of the team buying out both Zach Parise and Ryan Suter, they were stifled by three years of salary cap weight totaling over $10 million annually. That burden severely limited the Wild&#x27;s ability to build around superstar winger Kirill Kaprizov, particularly in a 2023–24 campaign where his 46 goals went to waste without even a playoff appearance. Now, however, the impact of the Parise and Suter contracts is negligible on Minnesota&#x27;s finances, so Guerin is free to do deals without those 30x30 skinny jeans crushing his waist. The results? Well, actually, not that much so far.
The one thing you need to know, if you want to know anything about the Minnesota Wild, is that they are the most &quot;slightly above average&quot; franchise in the history of the NHL. Dating back to 2013, they have missed the postseason only twice. But in that time, they have won exactly two playoff series, and none since 2015. Their regular seasons are usually pretty solid, but time and again they get walloped in a best-of-seven. By the time trophies are being polished, nobody anywhere is thinking about the Wild.</span>

                              <span>Let&#x27;s face it, we have been living through a pop cultural age—particularly in cinema—made in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s image. Before Marvel, before George Lucas sold Star Wars to Disney, Tarantino made nerd culture mainstream, showing that a movie- and culture-obsessed kid could bring that obsession to life in their own art, to great success.
Tarantino wasn&#x27;t the only one, of course. He was part of a generation of auteurs who were the right age to have grown up watching TV their whole lives, who made post-modernist art that seemed to be just as much a commentary on the things they consumed as they were new and unique works in their own right. Tarantino was just the first one to hit the jackpot, emerging in the early &#x27;90s with a showy directorial debut Reservoir Dogs and two buzzy scripts eventually adapted by big-name filmmakers Tony Scott and Oliver Stone. Then in 1994 he cemented his place at the front of this new wave with Pulp Fiction, one of the finest independent films of the decade, a cultural earthquake that is still felt to this day.</span>

Everybody knows about the MAGA hat. It’s red. It says what it says on it. The content of the MAGA hat is obvious. It’s a team hat, a cult uniform, a panting, sniveling dare for you to say something about it. It is, for better or worse, iconic at this point, the single image or object that exemplifies this movement, the illustration that will appear in future history books so long as Elon Musk hasn’t had Grok “rewrite the entire corpus of human knowledge” by then. But its iconicity is not just limited to its color and its catchphrase. The FORM of this hat matters, in part because it’s such a telling one.</span>

                              <span>You oughta know by now: This is Defector Music Club, where a number of our writers get together to dish about an album. Today, in honor of Bills Week, Dave McKenna, David Roth, and Lauren Theisen debate Billy Joel&#x27;s 1977 smash The Stranger.
McKenna: Stunning how few rock and roll Bills are out there! But Lauren’s suggestion that we take up Billy Joel and The Stranger took me back. Everything takes me back at this age, sure, but this record hit the bins at the end of the Summer of 1977, which I spent with my cousins in Astoria, Queens, when my feelings for Billy Joel were their fondest. I was into guitars and dirtball rock. The only keyboard guys I gave my time to were bombastic longhair prog rockers with walls of organs and synths, like Rick Wakeman of Yes or Keith Emerson of Emerson, Lake and Palmer. (This nostalgia wave got me to dig out the Yes belt buckle I bought on Steinway Street in Astoria for $5 that summer.)</span>

                              <span>To call it a &quot;pleasant surprise&quot; wouldn&#x27;t quite be right. As someone with an abiding interest in the colorful names and nicknames of Brazilian athletes—my all-time favorite remains that of Leandro Matos Souza, who went by &quot;Gatorade&quot;—I had a hunch that a particular theme week–inspired Google search would turn up the result I was hoping for. So, while certainly pleasant, it was hardly surprising that typing &quot;bill footballer&quot; into my search bar brought me to not one, but two mononymous Brazilian Bills.
Though I&#x27;m sure the player Wikipedia designates &quot;Bill (footballer, 1999)&quot; has an interesting story of his own, today we are going to focus on the life and times of one Rosimar Amâncio, the better known of the two Bills. Our chosen Bill is a 41-year-old striker who has traversed the globe in one of those far-flung journeyman careers that are pretty unique to a certain class of Brazilian player. Brazil not only produces more professional-caliber soccer players than any other country, but the nationality itself, with its redolence of jogo bonito and World Cup wins and flashy tricks and Pelé and Romário and Ronaldinho and Neymar and the like, means that the Brazilian player is highly coveted globally both for what they can do and for what they represent. Couple that with the Brazilian economy, which is relatively advanced but nevertheless struggles to provide a comfortable living for its entire population, and you can understand why it&#x27;s so common to find a handful of Portuguese names on the rosters of tertiary soccer leagues the world over.</span>

                              <span>The Buffalo Bills of my childhood are not the Buffalo Bills I live with now. They are certainly not the Buffalo Bills I’ve written about before on this website.
It’s weird to think about in retrospect. The Bills went from clockwork ineptitude to clockwork competence with only a handful of transition years in the middle, from the team I finally saw suit up for a playoff game when I was 19 years old to the team that has won five division titles in a row. From the basement to the top of the league.</span>

                              <span>TOULOUSE, France — They were going to make it. After working with three riders all day, staving off the pursuit of five others, and eventually holding off the determined charge of a former world champion, Uno-X&#x27;s Jonas Abrahamsen and Jayco&#x27;s Mauro Schmid rode into Toulouse together to contest Stage 11 of the Tour de France. One of them was going to earn their first career Tour de France stage win. The other would leave with nothing. All I knew as I saw the pair wind up for the sprint was: I was going to talk to the loser.
Breakaways succeed only rarely and only for reasons that are legible in retrospect. You need to be a strong rider to win from a breakaway, but more than that you need to be a good gambler, which is code for: blessed by divine providence. Moves off the front of a race only succeed when the strongest teams decide against expending the energy necessary to chase them down or, in quite rare cases, do some gambling of their own and leave the chasing too late. Chasing everything down is usually worth the best teams&#x27; while, so many breaks are by their nature doomed. That makes the ones that work extra precious.</span>

At first I had a hard time with this mandate—I could not think of anything &quot;newsy&quot; related to Bill—until I remembered that in the 1979 television miniseries Salem&#x27;s Lot there is a scene in which a guy yells &quot;Bill!&quot; a bunch of times. What could be more salient to the interests of Defector readers than that, I ask you—nothing!

There is nothing sacred about the All-Star Game, and nothing really to mourn about the fact that a game that was tied after nine innings didn’t proceed to the tenth. But the fact remains that the Most Valuable Player in Tuesday night&#x27;s exhibition officially went 0-for-2 with a walk during that game, and that the box score does not in any way reflect the only thing about that game that people are discussing today.
Indeed, that very box score reflects the historical, artistic and essentially pastoral nature of the same with these famous and memory-invoking stars:</span>

                              <span>The Buffalo Bills open training camp a week from today and running back James Cook isn’t happy. A year ago, Cook flourished when new offensive coordinator Joe Brady introduced the team to the concept of handing the ball off. Now Cook would like to be compensated for his services before he falls off the running back cliff, just as his brother Dalvin did in 2023. James Cook is no dummy. He wants his money while he can still get it.
For other teams, this would be fairly garden-variety standoff that results in a camp hold-in before both sides agree to a deal sometime in August. But this is Buffalo, where any ripple in the waves causes Bills fan to have Bills fan thoughts. You never want to have Bills fan thoughts. A minor contract dispute with the RB1 begets thoughts about the rest of the team’s backfield depth, which begets thoughts about Josh Allen running the ball himself far too often, which begets thoughts about the passing game, which begets DEAR CHRIST WILL WE EVER WIN A SUPER BOWL OR DID I STICK AROUND THIS FROZEN WASTELAND MY WHOLE LIFE FOR NOTHING?</span>

                              <span>For a series with little by way of story, it&#x27;s impressive how many iconic non-player characters Pokémon has spawned. There is of course Professor Oak, who sets the player on their path to be a master trainer in the original games, as well as Brock and Misty, gym leaders who grew to be fan favorites in the anime series. And who can forget Blue a.k.a. Gary, the rapscallion first rival in Generation One? These are just a few of the endearing NPCs who have left a mark on both the series and popular culture across the series&#x27; nine generations of games. (There&#x27;s also Hop, from Generation Eight, who is very annoying.) However, my favorite NPC is also, in my opinion, the most helpful: Bill, the Pokémon Maniac from Red, Blue, and Yellow.
When the player first meets Bill at his house at the Cerulean Cape, near the second gym, he is not human. Bill, a Pokémon obsessive who is also something of a mad scientist, has seen a Pokémon teleportation experiment of his backfire, which has physically combined him with one. The player helps get Bill fixed up, and it&#x27;s all cute and silly. What is not silly is what Bill does for the player, giving them access to the Pokémon storage system, afterwards known as &quot;Bill&#x27;s PC.&quot;</span>

                              <span>When Major League Baseball announced the roster for the 2025 All-Star Game, it was no surprise to see William &quot;Will&quot; &quot;Bill&quot; Smith listed as the starting catcher for the National League. The backstop has been tremendous for the Dodgers since he debuted in 2019, and this season is on track to be his own personal best. Showing sturdy power, savvy plate discipline, and a sweet swing, Bill was apparently tired of hearing people say he &quot;hits well for a catcher.&quot; Among NL batters, Bill is leading the field in average and on-base percentage, and his OPS is second only to his L.A. teammate Shohei Ohtani.
Said fellow Dodger Freddie Freeman, “People are gonna tune into the All-Star Game, they’ll throw his numbers up on the TV, and they’re gonna be like, ‘Whoa, that’s a really good season.’”</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a few weeks since we heard anything salacious, greedy, stupid or just plain time-wasting from Bill Belichick, which is a surprise as well as a blessing given that he is one of those sports figures who producers and station managers never tire of churning. In short, enjoy the sounds of nature in a vacuum, because fall practice starts soon and we are about to relearn what it&#x27;s like to be angry at and sick of the North Carolina Tar Heels the way we were the New England Patriots.
But that&#x27;s no longer the standard, because as much as he wants his new job to be about football, he knows in a corner of his mind that he is actually a science experiment on the hoof. Specifically, how Old Folks America can pretend to be interested in a team just because he&#x27;s there at a time when that team is in a sport that&#x27;s shrinking back into a regional entertainment. It is a question of how long bankable fame actually lasts before it turns into something pejorative, or worse. It is also a test case on how long teenagers in an open market can be moved by someone who is a hero to their parents and grandparents.</span>

                              <span>Financier Bill Ackman has been widely shamed for his appearance in a professional tennis tournament last week. Since shame is no longer operative in American culture, he&#x27;s continued to explain every painstaking detail of the experience in his tweets, which read like a transcript of a front-facing video filmed in a car. In the course of defending his embarrassing appearance at the Hall of Fame Open, Ackman is approaching something like performance art.
Ackman denied the charge that his doubles match at the tournament was a pay-for-play situation. &quot;Many also claimed that I bribed the [International Tennis Hall of Fame] for the wildcard, which is entirely untrue,&quot; he wrote on Sunday. &quot;The HOF asked me for nothing and I made no commitments to the HOF. I had in the past donated to the HOF, but had done nothing in recent years.&quot; When denying a bribe, it&#x27;s always important to complete the terms of the bribe: Ackman announced a few paragraphs later that he would be granting the Hall of Fame a &quot;$10 million endowment that I will manage for free.&quot;</span>

                              <span>When I was growing up, my mother kept notebooks where she meticulously recorded every dollar our family spent. She never talked about them with me, she just left the notebooks on the kitchen table where I could see them. I would flip through the lines of expenses, horrified at the dollars and cents I’d incurred by just existing, terrified that I would bankrupt our family. 
My parents were young and making it work on a second lieutenant&#x27;s salary, so they didn’t earn much money to begin with—as the child of Korean War survivors, my mom learned to hold tight to what little she had. With her savvy budgeting, she kept me fed and clothed and even entertained. We spent countless afternoons at the library and in the children’s department of the city’s free art museum. Decades later, my family’s financial situation has improved drastically, but the years of scarcity have shaped us both. She still records her expenses in the notebooks and hides the majority of her money from herself so she won’t spend it. From her, I learned that money is a source of fear and shame.</span>

                              <span>One advantage I have always held in the literary arts is speed. I am a fast reader and an even faster scanner. I can draft quickly, churning out hundreds of words as if turning on a spigot. It&#x27;s an advantage in the age of quantity, and the ability to write a lot all the time is one I never take for granted. But it is a blessing as often as it is a curse. What you lose with speed is often beauty, care, and intention. If I wrote as fast as my brain would prefer (at the speed of light), there would never be a good turn of phrase, and I would hate myself. But I hate myself all the same when I force myself to go slowly in order to make something beautiful and creative, because it is so hard for me to do so.
For a piece I really care about, I have a lot of tricks to convince my brain to slow down, and think more critically and carefully about the words in front of me. I sometimes write longhand before transcribing to the computer. To revise, I will read the sentences from bottom to top to make sure they all stand up on their own. And when I&#x27;m feeling very bogged down and uninspired by the English language, I read Shakespeare.</span>

                              <span>There is no shortage of entrepreneurial Bills in New York City. A trip around town can bring you to such businesses as the diner Bill&#x27;s in Ridgewood, the bike shop Bill&#x27;s Cyclery in Woodside, the jazz club Bill&#x27;s Place in Harlem, or Bill&#x27;s Supper Club in Midtown. (There is also a Brooklyn bar called Post No Bills—a command we are vehemently disregarding this week.) But out of all the Bills in my city, I selected Bill&#x27;s Wines &amp; Liquors in Sunnyside, Queens.
I&#x27;ve lived in Brooklyn for the last eight years, but I&#x27;ve recently been spending a lot of time in Astoria, at the northwest tip of Queens, because that&#x27;s where my boyfriend lives. I can&#x27;t claim that there&#x27;s any grander reason why I chose Bill&#x27;s Wines &amp; Liquors over the other Bills than &quot;it was the closest.&quot; So: High marks for Bill&#x27;s in convenience.</span>

                              <span>On Monday night, Major League Baseball gathered together all the big boys with their big bats from around the league to show off for us. And they did! Cal &quot;Big Dumper&quot; Raleigh showed off the most, and so he won.
Every year, MLB gets all these big boys with their big bats, and they line them up on national television and ask them to hit baseballs one million miles. This is cool. I like to watch this! I am in no way a Home Run Derby hater, because I think it&#x27;s fun when guys who play games for a living get to play games for fun.</span>

What are the odds!
Sabrina Imbler: I am no statistician, but I imagine they are quite low! I spent the past month in the Adirondacks, and had no idea Kathryn also came up to the beautiful North, and the land of loons. I too saw loons on a lake and informed Barry Petchesky, because this is simply how things are done here. Barry then told me that Kathryn had also seen loons, and this is all the context you need to understand how we arrived here, in this blog. Kathryn, was this your first loon sighting? What did you know of loons before this weekend?</span>

                              <span>Bill Simmons has been a part of my life for about 20 years now. As with any relationship that lasts that long, my feelings about him have evolved. At various points I&#x27;ve been a fan, a hater, a critic, a detached observer, and a begrudging admirer, sometimes all at once. 
I&#x27;m not alone in this. I have only recently discovered that I am part of a whole demographic of sports fans for whom Simmons occupies an odd, conflicted space in their media diet. They are dedicated listeners of his podcast, which they primarily consume in order to find things to make fun of him over, and they would be devastated if Simmons were to retire tomorrow. Thousands of these people congregate on a subreddit dedicated to Bill Simmons, where they crack jokes at his expense, maintain the lore of The Bill Simmons Podcast universe, and speak in a language that can only be understood by fellow sickos. Some of them even listen to a podcast about The Bill Simmons Podcast.</span>

                              <span>The MLB All-Star Game has unfortunately been handed over to Pat McAfee, who spent Monday kicking off the week&#x27;s festivities on ESPN. What better way to get baseball fans excited about the Home Run Derby than by subjecting them to a few hours of a poached ex-punter bellowing about a sport he barely follows while he embellishes his yinzer accent?
McAfee had a few lowlights today. While emceeing a press conference with Tarik Skubal, Paul Skenes, Dave Roberts, and Aaron Boone, he stammered his way through an answer to some pointed questioning by Jen Ramos Eisen. He also duffed an interview with Shohei Ohtani, at one point instructing Ohtani&#x27;s interpreter to provide some &quot;energy on the delivery&quot; of his question. But McAfee&#x27;s most embarrassing moment was probably donning a sleeveless jersey while sucking up to MLB commissioner Rob Manfred by stumping for a salary cap:</span>

                              <span>It must be said that the 2024–25 European soccer season belonged to Paris Saint-Germain. After a shaky start, which saw them come within a whisker of failing to even make it out of the forgiving league stage of the new Champions League format, the Parisiens bought a new star, found themselves, and hit their stride. Behind a well-ordered but dizzyingly, dazzlingly fluid style of play, and supernova turns from the likes of Ousmane Dembélé and Vitinha, PSG ended the season blowing away all challengers, capped off by an iconic 5–0 demolition job against Inter in the UCL final. The sumptuous play, imposing results, and the youthfulness of the roster won the team the biggest title in the club game, will likely win Dembélé the Ballon d&#x27;Or, and marked this team as a potentially era-defining one.
And yet, at what I guess is the official close of that season, PSG is not the team standing in the spotlight today. Though the French club was the massive favorite to add the title of world champion to its extended list of accolades in Sunday&#x27;s Club World Cup final, it was actually Chelsea that wound up lifting the trophy by doing what PSG had made its calling card over the last seven months: going up against a great team and beating the hell out of them.</span>

                              <span>Whatever the Thrilla in Manila was, this wasn&#x27;t that. Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano, who previously gave the world two of the greatest fights in recent memory, delivered a comparative stinker while capping off their trilogy atop the bill of the first all-women’s professional boxing card on Friday at the sweet science&#x27;s holiest room, Madison Square Garden.
Taylor, in what could be the final bout of her incredible career, took a majority decision over Serrano after 10 mostly lackluster two-minute rounds. Judge Mark Lyson scored the fight a 95-95 draw, while Steve Weisfeld and Nicolas Esnault both had Taylor winning easily, 97-93. With the win, Taylor holds onto her undisputed super-lightweight championship.</span>

                              <span>For all its miracles, the internet has had some drawbacks. Before the internet, people generally had more friends, and more lasting relationships; they went outside more, and were more physically active; the fighting weight of the average cultural product was a little higher. I don&#x27;t really care about all that unimportant stuff, though. The thing that was most obviously more enjoyable before the internet could tell you everything about everything was pro wrestling. 
I know some people enjoy the backstage stuff as its own soap opera, and more power to them. In what is no way a pathetic nostalgic yearning for the simplicity of childhood, I preferred when angles didn&#x27;t carry a second, meta element, when watching wrestling didn&#x27;t require knowing all about the workplace politics that went into its booking. I miss not knowing who a guy was, because then he could be anything. If the current industry is better in many ways, it could never give us a push like Bill Goldberg&#x27;s.</span>

That before long, the first step to heading to the Moon or Mars would be as workaday as boarding a shuttle for a quick jaunt to low Earth orbit. It proved a beautiful, flawed achievement: Two traumatic catastrophes showed early safety analyses were overgenerous, but the Shuttle did provide the freight and manpower for the first tentative steps toward a permanent spacefaring presence, and all the science that came with it. The craft themselves are retrofuturist works of art: gleaming white above, reverse countershaded beneath, all swooping curves and aerodynamic lines. A stately relic of space-age optimism.
It&#x27;s no wonder, upon the program&#x27;s retirement, that everyone wanted a Shuttle. Twenty-one museums and institutions vied for the right to house one of the four surviving craft. NASA made its selections based on applicants&#x27; historical significance and plans to preserve and display the Shuttles, and in 2011 the winners were announced. The Intrepid Museum in New York received Enterprise; Kennedy Space Center in Florida got Atlantis; the California Science Center obtained Endeavour; and the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, an annex of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Fairfax County, Va., received Discovery.</span>

                              <span>An old boxing coach of mine became an avid tennis player after he retired from pro fighting. He always said that boxing and tennis were very similar. This never struck me as completely convincing. Yes, both are one-on-one sports, and both require strategic choices about how to attack and defend, how to break an opponent’s will. But in tennis, nobody is punching you in the face. I guess you could say there are both similarities and differences. 
To see tennis in New York City, take the 7 train way the fuck out in Queens to Willetts Point. Instead of turning left to go to the Mets Stadium, hang a right, over the MTA trainyard, down a long and alarmingly rickety boardwalk whose lumber creaks and moves under your steps. At the end you are rewarded with the sweeping vista of Flushing Meadows Park. The circle at the park’s entrance is named after David Dinkins, New York City’s first black mayor, who helped to bring the US Open to the USTA Tennis Center on the park’s edge. Dinkins was a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, a fact that Zohran Mamdani, our current mayor-in-waiting, brought up every time that one of his primary opponents tried to smear him as a communist due to his own DSA membership.</span>

                              <span>The VHS/DVD championship season recap is a lost art in the era of Youtube, but I&#x27;m old enough to remember when it was the only game in town. I&#x27;d see ads for them in the immediate aftermath of a title win—a chance to relive a great run through a curated collection of clips and interviews. We had the tape for the 1998 Red Wings in my home growing up, and a disc for the 2004 Pistons, but neither of those affected me quite as much as a video I borrowed from the library as a young kid, which introduced me to the concept of violent, aggressive basketball—a style I decided I wanted to play.
This was a tape recapping the 1988 Detroit Pistons season. That&#x27;s not a year in which they actually won a title, you might notice, but it was the first time Detroit ever made the Finals, pushing the Lakers to seven games. I was lucky enough to get taken to the library on a regular basis, and I did the thing that kids do when they go, which is grab whatever they see on topics they&#x27;re interested in. My topics included baseball, hockey, planets, those Eyewitness Books with all the cool pictures, and at some point, the Detroit Pistons.</span>

                              <span>The choice of Bills Week for this year&#x27;s What Defector Does When It Needs To Skive Off For A Week Week had an unforeseen deficiency when it was being spitballed by the Phlegm Committee. Specifically, we are historically low on Bills.
Between 1950 and 2008, the name Bill (or more specifically William), became gradually and increasingly uncool in the United States, according to data from the Social Security Administration. Even by 1980 a kid might as well have been named Jehoshaphat, Algonquin, or Xythron The Enfeebled. Most likely, Bill is the name of your last living relative, and if it isn&#x27;t, may he rest in peace. If you have a Bill in your family, cherish the old coot. Water him regularly, and keep the air in front of his easy chair free of things he can trip over. You need him mobile and independent, at least from you.</span>

                              <span>How does a person recover from this: holding three championship points in a Roland-Garros final, only to let them slip, fight for two more hours, and lose the whole thing in the fifth-set super-tiebreak, against your internationally beloved arch rival, who was spurred on by the crowd? That experience would pulverize the average person psychologically. But if you had to devise a human who could withstand it, you might end up with something close to Jannik Sinner, master of the emotional reset. Yes, he looked shell-shocked while sitting in his chair in the immediate aftermath of that loss to Carlos Alcaraz. According to his coach Darren Cahill, Sinner and his team had a good cry afterwards. They discussed a few tactical details from the match. And then, after a 24-hour period, they didn&#x27;t speak of that match again, and simply moved on to the grass season. Barely a month after that catastrophe, faced with the same happy and lethal opponent, with same magnitude of title at stake, Sinner locked in and won Wimbledon, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.
It&#x27;s been a long time since the world&#x27;s No. 1 player had notched a win over Alcaraz. Though Sinner has a staggering 99-9 record since the start of the 2024 season, five of those nine losses were inflicted by this one man. The defining rivalry of men&#x27;s tennis had swung in Alcaraz&#x27;s favor over the last two seasons, after a string of wins in Indian Wells, Roland-Garros, Beijing, Rome, and Roland-Garros again. Several of those matches were defined by Alcaraz&#x27;s lucid and vicious play in the highest-pressure situations, like the match tiebreaks in Beijing and Paris. More concretely troubling for Sinner was the fact that his clearest advantage over his rival, the serve, had been at or below average in those meetings, in terms of first-serve percentage. In order to shift the matchup back in his favor, he&#x27;d have to serve accurately and hold his nerve.</span>

                              <span>This seems like a pretty embarrassing time to be a member of the NFLPA. Not only has a series of reports revealed that executive director Lloyd Howell Jr. is at best a pushover for the owners and at worst someone whose own interests are actively aligned against those of the players, but now the union has demonstrated itself incapable of releasing a legible statement. 
Last week, ESPN dropped a pair of stories that seemed to herald Howell&#x27;s resignation. The first reported that NFLPA senior leaders struck a deal with NFL owners, in which they agreed to keep the bombshell results of an arbitration case about collusion a secret from the players. The second report revealed that Howell works as a part-time consultant for the Carlyle Group, which is attempting to buy ownership stakes throughout the league.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a little over a month since a judge approved the settlement terms agreed to by the NCAA and lawyers representing Division I athletes who brought several antitrust cases against the NCAA and its conferences in federal court. Things are already getting stupid.
The purpose of the settlement was, in broad strokes, to allow schools to begin directly paying college athletes while also reducing the influence of NIL collectives over how much players are compensated. Starting this summer, the settlement gives schools $20.5 million to spend on player compensation while also putting tighter restrictions on what types of NIL deals, which do not count against the $20.5 million cap, will be allowed under new regulations. NIL collectives that were previously able to pay players without much restriction will now have to prove that each deal that is signed serves a &quot;valid business purpose.&quot;</span>

                              <span>On a point-by-point basis, I will remember nothing about the women&#x27;s final at Wimbledon. Iga Swiatek&#x27;s 6-0, 6-0 win over Amanda Anisimova on Saturday, which lasted just 57 minutes, was the least competitive major final in recent memory. Swiatek had played for five major finals in the past and won all of them easily. Anisimova, a former teenage prodigy who&#x27;s taken the scenic route back to the top, had never played a final at this level. One player was so comprehensively prepared, and the other so visibly overwhelmed, that the match never really had a chance to cohere. What I&#x27;ll remember instead of any specific rally is this turning point in the career of Swiatek, a longtime grass-court non-believer who cast off her delusions, and pulled herself out of a title slump in the process.
Back in 2022, Iga Swiatek established herself as the top player of her generation. She kicked off a two-year, almost uninterrupted stint as the No. 1 player in the world. Here was the tour&#x27;s most complete baseline game: high-topspin shots powered by elite movement and focus so intense that if often left her opponents holding bagels and breadsticks. During that two-year stretch, at pretty much any tournament, you could pencil her into at least the semifinals.</span>

They’re 46-50, buried in their division by 13 games, and currently sit 4.5 games out of a Wild Card spot with a negative run differential and ace Cole Ragans on injured list. They don’t exactly look like the likeliest buyers with the trade deadline less than three weeks…</span>

                              <span>Sometimes you find yourself remembering a book. Such was the case a few weeks ago, when someone dropped this tweet into our DRAB Slack channel. &quot;In 2012 it seemed like every single person in New York City was reading The Art of Fielding,&quot; it said. &quot;On Goodreads it has 30,000 more ratings than Infinite Jest, and almost 3x as many readers as 2666. And yet it’s just completely gone. Never discussed. Zero impact.&quot;
Well guess what, buddy, we&#x27;re going to discuss The Art Of Fielding here and now, in the year 2025. It is true that this book was what you might call a &quot;hot release&quot; back in 2012—I personally remember every sports and sports-adjacent blogger at the time reading and talking about it—and it&#x27;s not inaccurate to point out that it doesn&#x27;t seem to have left much of a cultural impression. But who actually cares about all of that? What we&#x27;re here to find out is if this book is any good. I was certainly charmed by it when I read it in 2012—It&#x27;s a baseball book that&#x27;s also a campus book that&#x27;s also kind of about Moby Dick? Wow!—and I am curious to find out if the grizzled, 37-year-old version of me will be able to find things to like about it.</span>

                              <span>On Jan. 21, 2025, Molly was serving lunch in the prison cafeteria when a fellow trans inmate shared the news with her: A day earlier Donald Trump had signed an executive order declaring the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) was prohibited from spending money on any gender-affirming care for inmates. Molly realized that she and the 2,000 or so transgender people currently being held in federal prison faced a dire future: being prohibited from receiving gender-affirming care such as hormones for their gender dysphoria. 
A month later, Molly learned that a new BOP memo banned gender-affirming commissary items for trans inmates, such as makeup and women’s underwear, calling these offering &quot;items that align with transgender ideology.&quot; The memo also required guards to misgender trans inmates. Soon after, makeup, underwear, bras, and other gender-affirming items were removed from Molly&#x27;s prison commissary.</span>

                              <span>Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano go at it again at Madison Square Garden tonight. The fight’s being promoted as the biggest in the history of women’s boxing. Who could argue? It’s the first female trilogy matchup of note, in the most famous boxing arena in the world, and the previous two bouts were iconic thrillers. 
But as of this week, tickets from greedy Ticketmaster could be had for under $44, greedy fees included. That’s an astonishingly low get-in price for a fistic Garden party of such stature. The cheapest seat at the same building a night later for the &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic show will run you about twice as much.</span>

                              <span>Ben Healy races his bike like a Frenchman, which is to say that his creativity, pain tolerance, and willingness to gamble extend beyond the scope of his abilities. The Irish rider debuted at the 2024 Tour de France determined to win a stage, and while he rode bravely and twice put himself in position to win, all he won was hearts. He&#x27;s done himself one better this year, running away with a career-defining win on Stage 6 of the Tour. It was a gorgeous ride, one that validates Healy&#x27;s place as one of the peloton&#x27;s premier artists on the bike.
After the race&#x27;s elite greedily scarfed up the first five stages of the race, Stage 6 was the first chance for everyone else to get a crack at winning something. Tadej Pogacar had just put a minute into Jonas Vingegaard in the time trial, and after five hard days of patrolling the front of the race, it seemed clear that neither Visma nor UAE would invest yet again in setting up their team leaders. The stage&#x27;s terrain was rugged, and there are more important battles to fight down the road.</span>

                              <span>If a typically tight, unexciting late-stage tournament match can be redeemed with a great goal, João Pedro was the savior that Tuesday&#x27;s Club World Cup semifinal between Chelsea and Fluminense needed. Twice the Brazilian injected into the game the kind of inspiration and pinpoint precision that was otherwise in short supply. His first goal was a long-range beauty, an almost golf-like shot where João Pedro patiently settled the ball, lined up his target, scoped out the hazards in between him and it, measured his approach, and ripped a drive into the far-side netting. His second goal was even better, a strike of such force and purity and exactitude of footwork that I&#x27;m compelled to include the following video, which appropriately focuses on nothing but the shooting technique itself:
