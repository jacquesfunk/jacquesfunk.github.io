                              <span>The first five or so games of an NBA season can only give you so much quantitative data about how the next 77 or so will go—e.g. the Warriors might not be this great without Steph Curry because they have mostly played bad or injured teams; the Nets are not going to remain this competent, as Dennis Schröder will at some point miss a shot—but they are useful as qualitative exercises. Shots will go in or not go in at aberrant rates in the short term, which doesn&#x27;t tell you much, but the processes by which teams generate good shots and prevent their opponents from doing so tell you plenty. Some qualities, then, that the Milwaukee Bucks have shown through five games: unconnected, slow, stinky, creatively adrift, thin, and generally miserable.
The Bucks are 1-5, winners in Philadelphia on the second night of the season and then losers of five straight, with double-digit losses to the Bulls and Nets in there. They lost a heartbreaker to the Cavs on Saturday as Donovan Mitchell nailed a tough game-winner. The vibes are not great: Doc Rivers is all but openly wailing on the sidelines; Giannis Antetokounmpo is sitting through garbage time in a daze; Khris Middleton, who had surgery on both ankles this summer, has not played yet this season; Darvin Ham is on the bench; and the guy he brought with him from L.A., Taurean Prince, is giving quotes like, &quot;I just feel like defensively, our IQ has to go up.&quot; They are currently the biggest disappointment in the NBA, under circumstances that are not altogether that surprising.</span>

                              <span>All the issues that arise from the Ballon d&#x27;Or stem from misaligned expectations. Even after almost 70 years of footballers winning the thing, it&#x27;s still unclear to many what exactly soccer&#x27;s most prestigious individual prize is actually for. Is it meant to go to the single best player in the world? The best player on the best team? Should the winner have scored the most goals? Won the most trophies? How do you weigh club performances with national team ones? Does it even make sense to try to isolate and award an individual in what is an indivisibly collective sport? Is this whole affair so stupid, the criteria so unclear, the voters so random, the concept so flawed, that nobody should even care about it in the first place?
For better and for worse, the answer to all of those questions is &quot;it depends.&quot; Sometimes it&#x27;s easy, when the best player in the world wins literally everything for club and country and there&#x27;s no need for a multifactorial analysis. Other times, as was the case for the men&#x27;s Ballon d&#x27;Or this year, no candidate&#x27;s case is undeniable, and so you&#x27;re forced to wade into the subjectivity muck. It&#x27;s these non-obvious Ballon d&#x27;Or years that bring the controversy, but also make it more interesting by sharpening what exactly the award is getting at. And this year&#x27;s men&#x27;s BdO was one of the most controversial ones ever.</span>

                              <span>Hours after the Philadelphia 76ers lost at home to the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday night, news broke that Sixers star Joel Embiid dislodged Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes in some way during a confrontation in the locker room over a rotten, cynical piece of work Hayes published this past week. That is as determinate of a statement as can be made on the interaction, as the story broke via a series of confusing and contradictory reports that first characterized it as an assault. It doesn&#x27;t seem nearly that severe, but the NBA has confirmed it is investigating the matter.
&quot;We are aware of reports of an incident in the Sixers locker room this evening and are commencing an investigation,&quot; an NBA spokesman said. The public first became aware when Keith Pompey, in the most egregiously out-of-order manner possible, tweeted, &quot;Oh, boy, people will remember the Sixers season for all the wrong reasons. The team just dropped to 1-4 and Joel Embiid assaulted a reporter in the locker room.&quot; In a deleted reply to a fan asking for clarification of what exactly Embiid had done to the unnamed reporter, Pompey said Embiid &quot;punched him.&quot; Twenty minutes later, ESPN&#x27;s Shams Charania confirmed that an &quot;altercation&quot; took place, noting that Embiid took issue with Hayes&#x27;s latest and clarifying, &quot;Embiid shoved the columnist. No punch.&quot; Charania&#x27;s colleague Ramona Shelburne provided the detail that the &quot;shove was to the reporter&#x27;s shoulder.&quot;</span>

I voted. That was the one thing I knew I could do. I didn&#x27;t get the &quot;I VOTED&quot; sticker because they were all out of them; it was the last hour of the first day of early voting and the line was out the door of the high school gym when I got there. It looked like they were printing out fresh ballots for each new person, to keep up with the demand, but the man who handed me my ballot was too busy to hear me ask him if the thing that looked like a printer was in fact a printer, and I didn&#x27;t want to break the flow.</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t give out candy, or anything else, on Halloween. Not for reasons of miserliness or whatever; I simply live in a spooky-looking (at night) log cabin at the end of a very long and dark driveway branching off of a winding and hilly forest road in a low-density area. If any trick-or-treaters have visited my home in the seven Halloweens I&#x27;ve lived here, they were very small, dressed very convincingly as squirrels and raccoons, and left without knocking on the door.
I&#x27;ve had occasion, nevertheless, to form Halloween candy opinions and judgments in that time, from taking my own kids trick-or-treating. Raising kids in an area (&quot;neighborhood&quot; would be inappropriate, here; it&#x27;s just a road with some houses alongside) where trick-or-treating basically does not happen, you learn where the good nearby trick-or-treating districts are, and you travel to them. This means that pretty much by definition, for the past seven years my kids have trick-or-treated on Halloween only in places known to be especially good for the practice, where there are lots of decorated houses, lots of costumed trick-or-treaters, and lots of friendly people giving out lots of candy.</span>

                              <span>My fascination with PATCO was pure: I had no reason to go into South Jersey, and so, for a long time, all of those subway stations I passed when walking around Philadelphia were little mythical pockets of alternate existence from which people occasionally emerged. Sure, I could come up with a reason for a day trip to say, Collingswood or Haddonfield, but that hardly felt legitimate enough to forfeit the mystique. Judging by the dress of the people who left the stations, PATCO served commuters; when I eventually rode the PATCO Speedline, it should be to commute.
I&#x27;ll admit, I was appalled when the prospect of a Defector Atlantic City retreat cropped up. But while Atlantic City offered to my colleagues sportsbooks and blackjack and craps and a sense of glamour, it offered me something much less sick in the head: an opportunity to ride a new and mysterious transit line. Once I realized this fact, I was, shall we say, on board.</span>

                              <span>Open up any novel by David Peace and you will find ghosts, and people beset by ghosts. The haunted are almost always from the north of England, except for the ones in post-World War II Tokyo. They are obsessive and prone to paranoia, as the haunted tend to be; their self-destructive streaks are galvanic and inescapable. The worse things get—things always get worse—the hauntings become propulsive, dissociative experiences. It’s fitting that the late Mark Fisher, high priest of Hauntology, was a big fan. “You are not living with the dead. You are living with the living,” Philip Roth wrote in Sabbath’s Theater. Peace’s characters aren’t afforded such merciful clarity. As one of the many disordered minds in 1977 muses repeatedly: 
“This is why people die.
This is why.”
This is why people.</span>

                              <span>Japanese RPGs (JRPGs for short) do a lot of things right, but one thing they are not particularly known for is respecting the player&#x27;s time. Whereas Western AAA games like Horizon: Zero Dawn, Assassin&#x27;s Creed, or even the newer Legend of Zelda entries, pad their runtimes with open-world shenanigans, JRPGs usually earn their 100-plus hour runtimes the old-fashioned way: with a slow pace, lots of cutscenes and dialog, and grinding monsters for experience. At times, playing a JRPG can feel like watching a particularly engaging anime, if during every commercial break had you complete a puzzle or fight a monster before getting back to the show.
Metaphor: ReFantazio (let&#x27;s get this out of the way: the name is dumb) isn&#x27;t immune to this, especially at the beginning. The newest game from Japanese developer Atlus, makers of the Persona series as well as the more hardcore Shin Megami Tensei series, is a bit of a slow burn. Like their breakthrough masterpiece Persona 5 before it, the first couple of hours of Metaphor are an extended tutorial, which in practice boils down to doing scripted fights in between grand cutscenes that lay out the setting.</span>

                              <span>Species around the world are threatened by the illegal wildlife trade, which peddles in wares such as pangolin scales, elephant tusk, rhino horn, and rare woods. Smugglers stow these artifacts, or even the wildlife themselves, inside large shipping containers, which are too expensive and time-consuming to scan with an X-ray. To help sleuth out these objects, scientists at the Belgian nonprofit Anti-persoonsmijnen ontmijnende product ontwikkeling (which roughly translates to Anti-Personnel Landmines Removal Product Development, or APOPO in Flemish) are turning to a rat with an extraordinary sense of smell. Giant African pouched rats have been trained to sniff out landmines in the ground, tuberculosis in mucus samples, and even survivors in disaster zones. Can the eight trained rats of APOPO—Marty, Attenborough, Irwin, Betty, Teddy, Ivory, Ebony, and Fossey—rise to the occasion, and help stave off their neighbors&#x27; endangerment, or even extinction? We sat down with Ivory, who lives in the town of Morogoro in Tanzania, to learn about the smell of poaching, her itty-bitty uniform, and what kind of treats she likes most as a reward; here&#x27;s how she gets it done.

                              <span>Thousands of Dubliners showed up for the city&#x27;s much-anticipated Halloween parade on Thursday evening. They lined the streets from Parnell Street to Christchurch Cathedral, waiting for the promised three-hour parade that would &quot;[transform] Dublin into a lively tapestry of costumes, artistic performances, and cultural festivities.&quot; A likely story. There was no parade, and never was one. 
Would-be revelers started getting suspicious about an hour after the parade was supposed to begin, according to one attendee. The Gardaí, Ireland&#x27;s national police service, tried to disperse the crowds and put out the message on social media that &quot;contrary to information being circulated online, no Halloween parade is scheduled to take place in Dublin city centre this evening or tonight.&quot;</span>

                              <span>What&#x27;s the most upsetting thing you can imagine existing on the internet? How about two videos—one 28 minutes in length, the other 31—each depicting a masked man methodically torturing, and then killing, a teenage girl. The videos, which feature dismemberment via power tool and an eyeball being slit open by an exacto knife, were broadcast live on the dark web to a paying audience of snuff-film enthusiasts.
Relax. You won&#x27;t see any of that in Red Rooms, a French-Canadian psychological thriller directed by Pascal Plante, which does not feature any gore or violence. But it begins with something that is perhaps worse: A thorough description, even more detailed than the one I provided above, of the snuff films at the center of its plot. The descriptions are delivered to a silent courtroom, by a prosecutor who is trying a man named Ludovic Chevalier (Maxwell McCabe-Lokos) for the murder of three teen girls. All three murders were recorded, but the location of the third recording is unknown.</span>

                              <span>On the first play of their Wednesday night national showcase game in Oklahoma City, the San Antonio Spurs ran a lob play designed specifically for Victor Wembanyama. If you are going to begin a game by running a lob for one of the two best shotblockers in the NBA against the other, the most important thing to do is make you sure you drag that guy away from the rim. The Spurs did the right thing, shearing Holmgren from the ballhandler with one screen and impeding his path to the rim with a second, but by the time Jeremy Sochan lofted the pass, it was too late: Holmgren took flight and spiked the ball off the glass, then blocked the follow-up from Sochan. It was an assertion, a warning: More than one guy is pushing basketball forward on this court.</span>

                              <span>The greatest Shohei Ohtani playoff day was his first. That&#x27;s not to dismiss his overall postseason contributions—he had an uneventful World Series, and an amusing stretch of only getting clutch hits, but considering the sample size his numbers pan out as perfectly respectable, if not to expectation. Then again, the expectation was Ohtani&#x27;s typical narrative inevitability. Something like, say, in the very first game of the NLDS, when the Dodgers were down three runs in the second inning, and Ohtani smashed a high fastball from Padres ace Dylan Cease to tie the game in one swing. After six seasons without postseason Ohtani, suddenly there he was.
None of the other postseason days had quite the same feel as the first, due to a combination of Ohtani&#x27;s aforementioned perfectly respectable struggles and the Dodgers&#x27; postseason tendency to win or lose games by large margins. But even when Ohtani wasn&#x27;t getting on base, he had presence. For one, there was that broadcast graphic counting down the batters until he would arrive at the plate. Then there was the shoulder injury scare. And because Ohtani is Ohtani, even his failures had import. In the fifth inning of the Dodgers&#x27; series-clinching Game 5, Gerrit Cole struck out Ohtani&#x27;s fellow 80 FV prospect Gavin Lux with the bases loaded. Fine: It&#x27;s Gavin Lux. But then Cole struck out Ohtani, and that meant something. It&#x27;s a simple truism—big players make big moments feel bigger—but, well, there you have it.</span>

You! You’re a football fan. You have a team. Your team has a head coach, and you’re not entirely certain if your coach knows what the fuck they’re doing, or if they’re just a clueless asshat. How do you tell? Do you wait out the length of the coach’s contract and see if there’s a Super Bowl win along the way? Do you make sure they blitz a Hail Mary instead of sitting back and letting the magic happen? Do you ask the nerdy data nerds?</span>

                              <span>Bronny James scored his first NBA basket Wednesday night. The cosmic scriptwriters, working within the boundaries imposed by Bronny&#x27;s limitations as a basketball player, did their best. It was never going to be a significant bucket in the story of a basketball game, because Bronny isn&#x27;t very good and the Lakers are, or certainly intend to be. The setting was nice, though: The bucket came in the fourth quarter of a road game against Bronny&#x27;s hometown Cavaliers, in the only visit his Lakers will make to Cleveland this regular season. It so happened that the Lakers, off to an otherwise encouraging 3–1 start under new head coach and dynamic podcaster J.J. Redick, were in the process of getting comprehensively pantsed by the home team, leaving Bronny to handle the bad kind of mop-up duties. 
Bronny checked into the game with just over five minutes left in the fourth quarter, to a loud &quot;Bron-ny&quot; chant from welcoming Cavs fans, who by that point had been calling for him on and off for about three straight minutes of game action. The buzz continued, crescendoing whenever Bronny touched the ball over the next few Lakers possessions. Then, with about 2:15 left on the clock, Bronny pushed the ball down to the Cleveland baseline, retreated a few steps, jabbed as if to use a screen toward the middle of the court, and pulled up for a contested mid-ranger. The noise in the arena suggested a playoff game, including a huge pop when the shot fell.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s nice to have a whole roll call&#x27;s worth of names for a home run. We talk about them a lot, and the slang terms come in handy if you&#x27;re someone like me who hates using the same word over and over. Particularly in this World Series, which the Dodgers wrapped triumphantly on Wednesday night, all of those synonyms were put to good use in each game.
To wit: In Game 1, Freddie Freeman&#x27;s walk-off big fly made him an instant legend. In Game 2, L.A. won on the strength of a tater from Tommy Edman, a bomb from Teoscar Hernández, and a round-tripper from Freeman. In Game 3, the difference-maker once more was a Freeman dong. In Game 4, the Yankees got a morale boost from an Anthony Volpe grand salami. And in Game 5, New York was off and running early thanks to a jack from Aaron Judge, a blast from Jazz Chisholm, and a Giancarlo Stanton pancake to right. Pancake&#x27;s not even a real word for a homer, but it works, right? Anything violent and/or tasty will do.</span>

                              <img src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2024/10/GettyImages-2181364689.jpg" loading="lazy" class="media-object__media article-image" />

                              <span>In the last season in which the Los Angeles Dodgers did not make the playoffs, Barack Obama had not yet been re-elected. They were still pretty good in 2012, which was Andre Ethier&#x27;s last good season, Chad Billingsley&#x27;s last healthy one, and Kenley Jansen&#x27;s first as a full-time closer. They improved from 86 to 92 wins in 2013 and have not been below 91 wins or out of the playoffs in any full season since. They won just one World Series in that stretch, and it was both fully earned—the Dodgers had an absurd .712 winning percentage when they won the version of the World Series that ended the plague-warped mini-season of 2020—and somehow not really an outlier. The Dodgers won 111 games in 2022, for an equally absurd .715 winning percentage, and that team didn&#x27;t survive the NLDS. The Phillies team that made it through to the World Series that year won 87.
It doesn&#x27;t feel quite right to say that the Dodgers were cheated out of World Series wins during any of those years, with the possible exception of the semi-year in which they actually won it. They have been in the postseason for nearly a decade and a half, and have during that time become the model organization in the sport—as astute and farsighted as the most financially optimized franchises, as detail-oriented and forward-thinking as the most development-oriented, richer and more ambitious than just about any other team in the sport, and exactly as cynical as everyone else. It would have been strange if the Dodgers didn&#x27;t win a World Series somewhere in there, although it wouldn&#x27;t have felt quite right—it wouldn&#x27;t have been appropriately October-coded or appropriately Dodgers—if it wasn&#x27;t a little stupid when it finally happened.</span>
