                              <span>Once again, it is time for the Defector staff to go into seclusion for our annual company meetings and fall frolic. This year we are gathering in Atlantic City, America&#x27;s abandoned playground. We decided to hold a mini theme week to keep the site robust and full of blogs while we&#x27;re in meetings. This year&#x27;s theme: Risk!
Eight years earlier, Metallica had become the biggest rock band in the world. How they did it depends on who you talk to. The self-titled &quot;Black Album&quot; was either softer, slower, more accessible than their previous epic thrash, a concession to the tastes of contemporary music fandom, or, if you ask an early Metallica fan, they sold out. No matter. They sold. It went 16x platinum. Metallica, once the band of nitrous-huffing burnouts and metal-militia headbangers and your older brother who can&#x27;t keep a job and people who thought Guns &#x27;n&#x27; Roses was for girls, was now MTV famous, solidly mainstream. This was absolutely not a given. It could have tanked. Their fans could have turned on them. Bruce Dickinson, frontman of Iron Maiden, gave Metallica credit for &quot;taking the risk and deservedly reaping the enormous rewards.&quot;</span>

                              <span>I will admit that it has shaken me to my very core, or at least to the point where I have not been able to get through a post that was supposed to be mostly jokes. On Sunday, Donald Trump went to a McDonald’s in Feasterville, Pa., that I have previously visited plenty of times, a McDonald’s just down from the restaurant where my high school girlfriend worked. (That restaurant is now an AutoZone.)
Trump was there for a photo op designed to push the story, which has been a favorite among the sort of people that would like this kind of thing, that Kamala Harris never worked at McDonald’s. Though there’s no record of that gig—paper short-term employment records from 1983 wouldn’t have been kept, I am forced to explain seriously—the Washington Post writes that McDonald’s “accepts” that Harris worked there. Trump&#x27;s stunt was obviously a bit of pointless political theater; Trump was there for a photo op that would be considered embarrassing were it done by anyone else on the planet but the planet’s most embarrassing man. It was nonetheless covered pretty straightforwardly by the media, as they tend to do with Trump. He pretended to be a McDonald’s employee for 15 minutes; many news outlets used a headline that he “worked” there.</span>

                              <span>Promotion from the Championship into the Premier League is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is the greatest financial boost in world soccer, one that can change a club&#x27;s entire future. On the other, the clubs that make the trip into the top division often have to throw out everything that worked in the Championship in order to survive.
It&#x27;s not too bold to say that teams reliant on possession in their chase for promotion must quickly adapt to playing without the ball against the Liverpools and Arsenals of the world. This is a lesson that Southampton is learning ever so painfully at the start of this season, and whether the club takes it to heart or not will likely dictate whether the Saints go marching back to the Championship next season.</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s no percentage in being right about a baseball team you care about. It&#x27;s nice to feel smart, I guess, but &quot;feeling smart&quot; and for that matter &quot;being right&quot; are not really what I got into any of this for. Those are for gamblers and pedants, and of all the reasons that have made me care about the New York Mets during my life—habit and family custom and various personality defects specific to me, including but not limited to stubbornness and fatalism and whatever it is that makes people bite their fingernails—it has never crossed my mind that doing so was somehow a reasonable thing to do.
In a sense, being right about the team you care about is the last thing a person would want. Again, pedants and gamblers will differ on this, but they&#x27;re in it for different reasons. It fits, in a bleak sort of way, that those are the types of fans sports leagues seem to be selecting for, or actively trying to create; owners, being owners, would naturally prefer that their fans be consumers instead of ... whatever this other way of caring is. The consumer relationship is easier to produce and reproduce, and much more readily leveraged. It reflects the way in which owners and executive types understand more or less everything, but also it makes a sort of pragmatic sense. It is easier to understand a baseball team as an expensive entertainment product that generates revenue on various platforms than it is as a machine that helps people become insane in ways of their choosing.</span>

This year we are gathering in Atlantic City, America&#x27;s abandoned playground. We decided to hold a mini theme week to keep the site robust and full of blogs while we&#x27;re in meetings. This year&#x27;s theme: Risk!
As a general rule, risk is overrated, both as a spur to future success and as a general way of life. The myth that risk begets reward has always been a self-aggrandizing lie told by the ones who won and stood on the skulls of the ones who didn&#x27;t. The thought that risk is an excellent provider of adrenaline is actually provable nonsense. Risk, put simply, sucks.</span>

The only thing less cool than putting effort into your social media presence is paying someone to teach you how to put effort into your social media presence. The second wolf is the one who writes this column, who is curious about the way the attention economy has led many of us to commodify our identities online, the way that commodification can translate directly to money, and how requisite it&#x27;s all starting to feel.
Parasocial appeal is the core of what constitutes success on the internet right now. Are you able to convey your personality in such a condensed way that strangers feel like they know you, and even like you? Can you quickly tell the story of who you are through videos and images? It’s harder than it looks. If you don’t believe me, open up your front-facing camera right now and try recording yourself telling a funny story. Now, hit post. It’s miserable.</span>

                              <span>Lots of fans can claim to be &quot;long-suffering&quot; as a labeling fetish, even if they aren&#x27;t. New York Liberty fans, for instance, were long-suffering—until Sunday night, when they cashed in their 28 years without a championship and transitioned into &quot;deliriously smug, smugly delirious, and not even pissed at Sabrina Ionescu any more.&quot; It happens that fast. The previous almost-three decades notwithstanding, they got their money&#x27;s worth, and then some.
And then there&#x27;s this World Series, which is the dead opposite, and more&#x27;s the pity. Nothing will leaden eyelids quite like listening to Yankee fans and Dodger fans grind on the rest of us civilians about their respective places on the double-decker throne, let alone their shared hearkening back to their joint heritage as the keepers of the sport back when baseball had not yet cracked the Pacific Time Zone. A nation already hopelessly fractured and ready to go even more Serb and Croat two Tuesdays from now can safely unite as one, however briefly, in our hatred of both teams. The prognosis wasn’t good regardless, but expect the next fortnight to be hell with a Bob Costas voiceover. Fox has the games, but it&#x27;s not his voice that offends, you see; rather the subject matter.</span>

                              <span>How would you imagine the greatest individual season in NWSL history? Our hypothetical player would need to score a lot of goals, obviously. Breaking Sam Kerr&#x27;s single-season scoring record (18) would certainly get plenty of attention, so let&#x27;s put that at the top of the list. How about assists? Assists are important, too. Let&#x27;s say this player has ... five of those. Five sounds good. 
Let&#x27;s go back to the goals for a second. We know that all goals aren&#x27;t created equal, and that poachers and penalty specialists can often sneak their way to the top of the leaderboard. That just won&#x27;t do—we&#x27;re talking about the best season in history, here—so let&#x27;s make sure our player didn&#x27;t score any of her goals from the spot, and is out-performing her expected goals tally by two. We need more, though. Let&#x27;s get crazy and say that this player is an NWSL rookie, and arrived from Chinese Women&#x27;s Super League at age 25 to blitz the NWSL with the league&#x27;s first 20-goal season. We&#x27;ll need a fun, quirky statistic, too, so let&#x27;s say this player became the first in league history to score a goal against every team. And we need moments. Like, what if the record-breaking goal happened to be a 25-yard strike that makes a convincing case for being the hardest a soccer ball has ever been struck by a woman in a professional match? What if that goal looked something like this:</span>

                              <span>The playoffs tend to provide certain reminders about how postseason baseball works. The Yankees, in completing their 4-1 series win over the Cleveland Guardians to advance to the World Series, provided one about the importance of power. Hit 10 home runs in five games, as the Yankees did in this series, and you can overcome all manner of base-running errors, scuffed defensive work, and late-inning meltdowns. Just keep hitting the ball over the fence, and good things will happen for you.
Here&#x27;s another reminder: There is probably no hitter in baseball more terrifying to pitch to in a high-leverage situation than Juan Soto. The Yankees right fielder came to the plate in the top of the 10th inning, with the score tied 2-2, two men on base, and two outs. Soto was looking for a fastball from Hunter Gaddis, and he wasn&#x27;t going to let the at-bat end until he got one. What must it feel like to pitch to a locked-in Juan Soto, who possesses not only all the confidence and power that makes for a great clutch hitter, but one of the games most discerning eyes. I imagine it feels like being asked to chop down a redwood with a hatchet.</span>

                              <span>MINNEAPOLIS — Somehow, this will end, though your guess is as good as mine. In Game 4 on Friday night, the Lynx and Liberty arrived in a familiar place by unfamiliar means. Neither team bothered with the pretense of an early lead or deficit. This time, they played a game that from tip to buzzer felt true to the series: weird, tense, a matter of execution more than scheme. A Jonquel Jones layup and-one to even things up, 80-80, with a minute left, was the 13th tying score of the game. With 18 seconds left, the Lynx searching for a last shot, Bridget Carleton grabbed an offensive rebound and was fouled on the putback attempt. She made two free throws for a 14th and final lead change, 82-80. The WNBA’s two best teams head where they have long seemed destined, to a decisive Game 5 in New York on Sunday night. 
Lynx head coach Cheryl Reeve explained the game’s closeness in terms of “information gathered.” Game 5 will be the ninth time these teams have played each other this season, and the familiarity is starting to show. “Everything is getting harder,” Reeve said. “There’s no secrets at this point.” The teams’ de facto captains, products of the same college program and models of the league’s richness at power forward, pose identical matchup problems to each other.

&quot;There are a lot of things that people want to learn about you and your policies,&quot; Bret Baier of Fox News said to Vice President Kamala Harris Wednesday. By that point, the interview segment between the Republican TV host and the Democratic nominee was nearly over; moments before, it had devolved into Baier saying &quot;Hezbollah, Hamas, and Houthis&quot; over Harris saying &quot;&#x27;suckers&#x27; and &#x27;losers.&#x27;&quot;</span>

                              <span>At times, Anora comes across like a movie designed to attract the extremely online crowd, much in the same way as Charli XCX&#x27;s Brat, or Greta Gerwig&#x27;s Barbie, or the Safdies&#x27; Uncut Gems all did. It has all of social media&#x27;s favorite thematic elements: sex work, wealth and excess, class commentary, hot people, &quot;bisexual lighting,&quot; Tumblr-baiting images. It&#x27;s hard not to feel a little cynical when a movie so readily, gleefully plays the hits, though perhaps that is the point—the late-millennial/Gen Z cheese to lure in that audience and trap them into its fable about the limits of transactional fantasies.

                              <span>The Saint Louis Chess Club announced Wednesday night that 17-year-old grandmaster Christopher Yoo had been expelled from the U.S. Chess Championships for &quot;gross violations of our Code of Conduct and the U.S, Chess Safe Play Policy&quot; after he crumpled up his scorecard, stormed off, and allegedly &quot;struck a videographer from behind&quot; following his fifth-round loss to Fabiano Caruana. Per local NBC station KSDK, the cops said that Yoo was arrested and charged with fourth-degree assault. They identified the victim as a 24-year-old woman and confirmed that Yoo was released as the case will be dealt with in the juvenile court system.
While Yoo&#x27;s scorecard meltdown was captured on video, no recording of the full incident has been made public from which we can contextualize the somewhat vague verb &quot;struck.&quot; This has prompted some players such as former World Championship challenger Ian Nepomniatchi to wonder whether Yoo getting fully booted from the tournament was an overreaction. That&#x27;s a fair question—though, according to both KSDK and arbiter Chris Bird, Yoo outright punched the videographer, with Bird calling the punch &quot;completely unprovoked, from behind and in no way accidental.&quot; Levon Aronian, currently competing in the championships, said he saw a video of the &quot;awful&quot; punch and called it a &quot;well prepared punch to a completely innocent person.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Point: Friday playoff games are terrible, by Barry Petchesky
I sit here exhausted: glassy eyed, cotton-brained, every synapse a misery. I watched seven consecutive hours of baseball last night, most of them emotionally disastrous to my rooting interests. It kept me up several hours past my usual bedtime, and tossing and turning in much of my ostensible sleep. Today I feel like I got hit by a truck. I feel alive. This is how the postseason should feel.</span>

                              <span>Approaching José Quintana&#x27;s pitching should be relatively straightforward: Do not chase. The man does not throw strikes. Only about 41 percent of his pitches in 2024 have been in the zone, which ranks dead last among all MLB pitchers who threw at least 1500 pitches last season. 
That is just about the most aggravating archetype of pitcher to watch mow through your team&#x27;s lineup, but for all the readied complaints about plate discipline or sloppy hitting, suffering at the hands of Quintana was not a unique experience: Quintana had looked unhittable since late August. Clearly if the advice is, &quot;Please stop chasing,&quot; looking at batters trying to hit against Quintana leads to the conclusion that it&#x27;s not that easy.</span>
