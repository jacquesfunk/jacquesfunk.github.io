                              <span>Point: Friday playoff games are terrible, by Barry Petchesky
I sit here exhausted: glassy eyed, cotton-brained, every synapse a misery. I watched seven consecutive hours of baseball last night, most of them emotionally disastrous to my rooting interests. It kept me up several hours past my usual bedtime, and tossing and turning in much of my ostensible sleep. Today I feel like I got hit by a truck. I feel alive. This is how the postseason should feel.</span>

                              <span>Approaching José Quintana&#x27;s pitching should be relatively straightforward: Do not chase. The man does not throw strikes. Only about 41 percent of his pitches in 2024 have been in the zone, which ranks dead last among all MLB pitchers who threw at least 1500 pitches last season. 
That is just about the most aggravating archetype of pitcher to watch mow through your team&#x27;s lineup, but for all the readied complaints about plate discipline or sloppy hitting, suffering at the hands of Quintana was not a unique experience: Quintana had looked unhittable since late August. Clearly if the advice is, &quot;Please stop chasing,&quot; looking at batters trying to hit against Quintana leads to the conclusion that it&#x27;s not that easy.</span>

                              <span>Gigi Hadid opened the Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show Tuesday night to the pre-chorus of Chappell Roan&#x27;s &quot;Femininomenon.&quot; She sunk into a platform on the stage and the models began their first push down a runway that was once iconic but is now grasping for relevance. It makes some sort of sense that Victoria’s Secret chose this song to frame the return of its fashion show, which is actually just a long ad that the company managed to turn into a weird cultural touchpoint for 20 years.
Chappell Roan is one of the biggest pop stars of the year, and her earworm singles are the perfect kind of good-vibes, girl-power music for corporate advertisements, as long as you don’t listen to the lyrics too closely. Previous versions of the show might have had an artist like her join the Angels on the runway, but there’s no way Chappell Roan would have appeared at this. “Femininomenon” is a queer awakening, and a reminder of what lies on the other side of living for the male gaze, male approval, and male mediocrity. The pre-chorus goes, “I don’t understand why can’t any man / Hit it like / Get it hot/ Make a bitch / It&#x27;s a femme.” In the show, the word “bitch” was muted, which was jarring at first, but in a way also perfectly encapsulated the show&#x27;s toothless attempt at corporate feminism in its bid to recapture the affections of young women across the country.</span>

                              <span>In what has been something of a bait-and-switch experience for us both, Rohan Nadkarni&#x27;s last two visits to the podcast have come during weeks when I was out. Strategically, this is sound, just given that Rohan is effectively a third host whenever he&#x27;s on. But for both him and me, it was kind of a raw deal. Has he had any new sandwiches since last we spoke? Formulated any new opinions about Josh McRoberts? I suppose I could listen to those podcast appearances and learn the answers myself but uh, hold on, sorry. Sorry I have to start a new paragraph right now, it&#x27;s an emergency. Sorry!
Anyway, it was great to finally be reunited with two of my favorite podcast buddies for what turned out to be both a typically goofy and decently sports-heavy episode. It turns out Rohan has a new job, and at the risk of spoiling the episode, he has had some sandwiches lately.</span>

                              <span>The Tampa Bay Rays have no home. Well, actually they have a home but no roof, and as most of us understand the concept, a home without a roof is just an enclosure.
Hurricane Milton, the bastard that it was, tore the aged canvas-and-fiberglass roof off of Tropicana Field, the Soviet bunker–style home of the Rays since they were Devil Rays, and because the Trop is due to be replaced as part of our ongoing national stadium scam, there is no urgency to replace the roof or even necessarily play any more games on the grounds. It’s very much up in the air whether it will or even can be repaired for the 2025 season. As new stadiums usually need three years or so for construction (except for the A&#x27;s, who have needed 19 and still don&#x27;t have a hole in the ground), the Rays could be vagabonds through 2027, if not beyond.</span>

                              <span>Just two weeks after Helene barreled across Florida as a Category 4 hurricane and ripped through five other states, Category 3 Hurricane Milton delivered a devastating follow-up to the Sunshine State. Although Florida is more than familiar with extreme weather events, the back-to-back nature of such powerful storms has strapped the resources of a state that was still reeling from the aftermath of the impact of Hurricane Debby two months ago.
Helene proved the deadlier of the two storms, carrying devastating flooding to western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee and killing more than 200 people. As of Oct. 15, 92 people are still missing in North Carolina. In Florida, Milton ended up sparing a direct hit on Tampa that would have caused catastrophic, lethal flooding damage. Instead, the storm made landfall 70 miles south in Siesta Key, and its aftermath has killed at least 14 people. Milton left more than 3.2 million homes and businesses in the state without power, some of which had been without power since Helene hit.</span>

Bad news: Everyone is still talking about it because they are making fun of it, to the extent that the team has been forced to issue an apology for how it handled its media rollout.

As a result, BOS Nation announced itself with a promotional video built around a strained joke about testicles, which included the phrase &quot;goat balls.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Nothing about Tom Brady&#x27;s entrance into the Las Vegas Raiders&#x27; ownership group is funnier than the handwringing about how this new conflict might affect his broadcasting duties with Fox. That one’s simple—it won&#x27;t. Being an owner means he’s forbidden from doing some of the basic stuff that broadcasters do, from being critical of officiating to attending to basic pre-production duties, but Brady’s booth work always seemed like a lucrative way to kill time until this thing came along. If it means that Fox is on the hook for $37.5 million a year of Brady half-arseing his way through Falcons-Broncos, well, Fox hired Brady to be Brady. Breaking down Bo Nix for the Sunday proles was surely never the hook for him. For one thing, the cash was too good for him not to do it. For two, the appeal of the gig was surely diminished by the fact that there’s no way to prove beyond a doubt that you’re the best at it when you&#x27;re stuck musing about why Bo Nix isn&#x27;t.
But there&#x27;s more—much, much more. Brady is not going to rest on his freshly approved ownership percentage (five percent), not by any means. He is coming in to have, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal&#x27;s Vincent Bonsignore, “a much bigger role than people think in the direction of the franchise in all areas on the football side.” That&#x27;s according to the ubiquitous &quot;league source,&quot; which as we know could mean anything from Antonio Brown up to but not including Roger Goodell. It only makes sense that Brady isn&#x27;t just making a passive investment here.</span>

                              <span>The Alabama Crimson Tide are currently 5-1 and ranked No. 7 in the AP poll in Kalen DeBoer&#x27;s first season as head coach, so it&#x27;s hard to say that anything is necessarily &quot;wrong&quot; with this team. On paper, things are just fine, even with the one loss. It&#x27;s not like Bama never lost any games under Nick Saban. And yet, if you spend enough time in their corner of the internet, you&#x27;d think the sky is falling. After a big, tenure-defining win against Kirby Smart&#x27;s Georgia, DeBoer&#x27;s Tide blew it against Vanderbilt, the punching bag of the SEC. How bad was the loss? Beyond the fact that it was Vandy&#x27;s first win against a top-five team in their history, there was the added bonus that it was a top-to-bottom beating in which the Tide never held a lead all game.
It was a bad loss for a program of Alabama&#x27;s stature, made worse by the fact that it was followed up with another stinker in South Carolina. Alabama edged an unranked Gamecocks team by just two points, and looked vulnerable the whole game. In fact, the Tide have spent a lot of time looking vulnerable this year: They spent three quarters struggling against USF before finally pulling away late in the fourth, and even their big win against Georgia featured a heroic second-half comeback by the Bulldogs that turned what should have been a triumphant blowout into an escape.</span>

                              <span>The goalie goal is the holy grail. More than three times as rare in the history of the NHL as a five-goal game, there have been just 18 instances of a goalie scoring, by 15 different goalies. An intentional goalie goal—one where the goalie shoots the puck into an empty net, rather than being credited for being the last player to touch the puck before the other team scores an own goal—has happened just 11 times.

We all know that the rules don’t apply to us if we’re doing it for the kids. When did I lose you? 
The tough thing about doing crimes with others is that everyone has leverage on everyone else. (As a Scorpio, this is a nightmare scenario for me. I work alone.) And while sometimes the scarcity mindset is a scam, sometimes it’s a fact of life: there is a fixed number of people who can host a single bingo game. Within any suburban enclave there is only so many people who want to buy essential oils. There is a limit to how much petty lawbreaking one cop can pretend not to see without having his palms greased. But where exactly are these limits? We must go to casino night to find out.</span>

                              <span>It is difficult to grasp, from the outside, what Johnny Gaudreau meant to fans of the Columbus Blue Jackets, even in the two short seasons he spent there before he and his brother Matthew were struck and killed by a suspected drunk driver on Aug. 29. Columbus fans are used to their stars leaving: for more money, bigger cities, more competitive franchises. If Gaudreau shocked the rest of the world when he signed with the Blue Jackets, he didn&#x27;t shock Columbusites—he merely became one of them. He embraced them, and they embraced him in return. He wanted to be there. He always will be, in memory, because memory lasts longer than a life.
Tuesday marked the home opener for the Blue Jackets, and the night belonged to Gaudreau. The team revealed a memorial to Gaudreau on the concourse, featuring his used equipment and signs left by fans after his death, which will be there all season. All players on the Blue Jackets and the visiting Panthers wore his No. 13 in warmups. A video package was played on the jumbotron honoring his life. His wife Meredith and their two young kids were invited onto the ice as Gaudreau&#x27;s banner was raised to the rafters.</span>

Judge&#x27;s slump-busting and majestic two-run moonshot over the center-field wall in the bottom of the seventh inning highlighted his New York Yankees&#x27; 6-3 win over the Cleveland Guardians in Game 2 of the ALCS. 
Judge came into Tuesday night’s home game hitting just .133 with only one run batted in, one extra-base hit and zero homers this postseason. “Did he get it?” TBS play-by-play guy Brian Anderson asked as Judge sent a letter-high, 95-mph fastball from Guardians hurler Hunter Gaddis skyward.</span>

Before I get started, I just wanted to thank all of the readers, friends, and coworkers for their condolences last week. Everywhere I looked, social media included, I saw nothing but kind words for my family. The internet is a better place than it’s often reported to be, and you people stand as proof of that. So thank you. It’s been a pleasure writing for you all, and it always will be.</span>

                              <span>The Dodgers pitching beast that had looked so invulnerable for the last two games of its series with the Padres and its first nine innings against the Mets suddenly toppled in the beginning of NLCS Game 2. Such are the momentum swings of the postseason, and such is the damage that sophomore third baseman Mark Vientos can do when he locks onto a ball from the batter&#x27;s box.
After a glum 9-0 loss on Sunday night, it was Mr. Smile himself, Francisco Lindor, who gave the Mets a pick-me-up with a lead-off dinger to right against Dodger opener Ryan Brasier. That longball not only punctured L.A.&#x27;s lengthy scoreless streak, it also helped set up the key moment of the ballgame as Landon Knack labored through the second inning. Scooping up a couple of outs while allowing a single, a walk, and an RBI double, Knack was set to face the 1-for-1 Lindor with men on second and third and the score already 2-0. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts directed his man toward the correct strategic decision, sending Lindor to first on an imaginary quartet of balls. But the choice to face the next man in the order over Lindor only steamed up the Mets&#x27; two-spot hitter, who&#x27;s no slouch himself.</span>

                              <span>Strap yourself in for this one: There are allegations of cheating at the annual World Conker Championships. It gets worse: The man accused of breaking the rules is King Conker himself. While being searched after the event, a steel conker painted brown was found in King Conker&#x27;s pocket. I will give you a minute to compose yourself.
For the one or two of you unfamiliar with the sport, conkers is a traditional childhood game in the U.K. Players put a string through a horse chestnut seed and crash their conkers together. The player with the conker that breaks first loses the match and, presumably, their pride for losing at such an important sport. Here’s the entry from the Encyclopedia of Traditional British Sports, right after cock throwing. (I am not looking that one up.) The game was first written about in an 1821 memoir, but it appears other nuts and snail shells were used too.</span>

                              <span>Eagles fans love to complain about the team. Eagles fans love to complain about the head coach. This week they’re getting a chance to do both after the team won, which perhaps raises the bar on what can be considered a perfect Eagles game. On Sunday the Eagles pretty much played like shit against a team they were expected to beat by more than a touchdown. Fans seemed pissed the whole game. Like, more than usual, and for more obvious reasons than usual.
Much of that ire went toward Nick Sirianni. He heard it during Sunday’s 20-16 win over the lowly Browns, a game in which the Eagles never trailed and never really seemed to get going. Philadelphia fans are rarely happy, but they had a right to complain in this one. The Eagles got wide receivers A.J. Brown and Devonta Smith back from injury. Lane Johnson returned to anchor the offensive line. The team was coming off a bye and playing at home one of the worst teams in the league. And while they got the job done, booing was a pretty reasonable response to the experience of watching them do it.</span>

                              <span>The Jets are a team that specializes in unfulfilled promise. The promise of the 2023 season was Aaron Rodgers&#x27;s arrival, and was dashed the moment his Achilles tendon rolled up the back of his leg in the season opener. The start of this season brought even more promise: While Rodgers was out last year, the rest of the Jets&#x27; roster cohered into one of the league&#x27;s more talent-rich outfits, and it wasn&#x27;t hard to imagine a team that went 7-10 with Zach Wilson starting most of the games suddenly becoming a force after Rodgers reclaimed his position. A 2-3 start put a damper on things, but also opened the door for promises to be made. It was a coaching problem! With Robert Saleh shitcanned and Nathaniel Hackett stripped of his play-calling duties, the Jets would finally—finally!—be ready to transform into the great team their roster says they are supposed to be. Monday night&#x27;s game against the Bills was a great opportunity for the Jets to finally start making good on some of those promises.
Did we see a transformed and re-energized Jets team on Monday night? Well, the offense looked better than it had. Todd Downing&#x27;s play-calling opened some running lanes for Breece Hall that were previously hard to come by, and Rodgers had his best game as a Jet, throwing for 294 yards and two touchdowns. But is a team that is about to turn the corner one that loses 23-20 to a sputtering division rival at home? Is a team that has ironed out its inefficiencies one that nets one touchdown from four red-zone drives, gets repeatedly run over by Ray Davis and Ty Johnson, misses two field goals, and commits 11 penalties? The Jets under Saleh were a team that dropped way too many passes, drew way too many flags, and routinely undid itself with mistakes of all varieties. Our first look at the post-Saleh Jets indicates that this is still a team that drops way too many passes, draws way too many flags, and knows just how to undo itself with stupid mistakes.</span>

                              <span>Let us say—just as an example—that you were switching back and forth on your TV Monday night, between the ALCS and your favorite hockey team during commercials. Let us pretend, in this scenario, that you did not always switch back to the baseball game in time for the start of each inning, and sometimes missed a few pitches. Let us also imagine that at the start of the bottom of the third, you tuned in just in time to see Juan Soto crank a ball just over the wall in right-center. As he rounded the bases, you would naturally have turned your eyes to the score bug in the top-right of your screen. There, at first glance, and also second and third glances, you would notice the little bases graphic has second base a different color than the other two—lighter, filled in. You have been conditioned by a lifetime of score bugs to know what this means: There was a guy on second! Soto&#x27;s was a two-run home run!
But no. It was a solo shot. The TBS graphic is just like that. It makes it look like there&#x27;s always a runner a second.</span>

                              <span>Everything about the Europa Clipper mission is huge. Sent to investigate the ice-covered and perhaps habitable second moon of Jupiter, it is qualified by NASA as a Large Strategic Science Mission, conveying with that designation its outsized cost, the peak technical capabilities of its instruments, and the importance of the science it expects to undertake. It is just the seventh planetary science mission to receive the LSSM designation, an elite group that includes landmark missions like Voyager probes and Mars rovers.
The spacecraft itself is massive: the largest NASA&#x27;s ever built. Twenty feet tall, 72 feet wide when its panels are deployed—about the length of an 18-wheeler—more than 13,000 pounds, nearly half of that propellant, the rest the lightest-weight tech there is. Look at this beast.</span>

                              <span>BROOKLYN, N.Y. — I chuckled when I saw the words printed on the giveaway T-shirts at Finals Game 2 in New York on Sunday afternoon: “NOT DONE YET.” A kinder reading goes that all contenders think like this, no matter their situation. In the shadow of a Game 1 win, those words might have projected a noble kind of focus. We won’t rest on our regular-season laurels. Job’s not finished. Eyes on the prize. Giveaway shirt production lead times are probably not such that the Liberty ordered thousands of these to cope, anyway. But the shirts took on a slightly grimmer, funnier meaning in light of what actually happened in Game 1: an awful New York collapse. Now, methought the shirt doth protest too much. The “Our Season Is Definitely Not Over” T-shirt had people asking a lot of questions already answered by the shirt.
In a technical sense, it was true, though. The Liberty were not done yet. They still had a split to salvage in New York. And their home crowd, if volume was any sign, loved them no less for their choking. Fans might have felt a sense of déjà vu as the Liberty went up 17 points early, gutted through the second and third quarters, and then let the Lynx make it a one-possession game late in the fourth. But Breanna Stewart, she said afterward, was determined not to let “history repeat itself.” A determined Stewart is an awesome sight, and her arms made possible an alternate ending. Minnesota tried running back the small lineup that had worked for them in Game 1, but Stewart reminded them why it had always been a risky idea. She timed jumps like a defensive back to grab Minnesota lobs out of the air; she hung low to wreck entry passes and dribbles. After Courtney Williams skated past Jonquel Jones to make it a 68-66 game with 3:40 left to play, the Liberty ended the game on a 12-0 run. Stewart would finish with eight rebounds and a Finals-record seven steals, three of them in the fourth quarter.</span>

                              <span>BERLIN — My toenail ripped five miles ago and the pain is overwhelming. The looming dark skies make good on their threat as rain begins to sprinkle. The wind picks up. My heart quickens. I am in the middle of every rollerblader’s nightmare. All around, skaters skid and slow for fear of falling or colliding.
A few feet ahead of me, a far-too chipper man in a white helmet races up to a woman as she cautiously makes her way down the road, her legs shaking harder with every glide.</span>
