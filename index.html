                              <span>No one knows anything. Everyone claiming to know something is lying. The odds are 50-50, always, even if they say the odds are different. And though it can be a delicious hell to watch cable news and scroll on your phone all night, it does not make actually the election get decided any faster. In all likelihood, there will be nothing to know until well past midnight, if not several days from now. It is perhaps unreasonable to expect anyone who cares about this country to truly log off in any real way, but perhaps you can make your evening less miserable as the polls close. What if you could go to the bookstore and pick up something that would be gripping enough to stop you from watching Steve Kornacki zoom in on some random county that is behaving slightly differently than it did four or eight years ago? What if you could escape this mortal level of hell by entering your imagination guided by a sure hand? 
Well, you could try! The key to choosing a good book for election night is that it must be engaging, plot-heavy, and more desirable than your phone. You must be so mesmerized by what is happening that you are more invested in the next page than you are in the results out of Fulton County, which, remember, you cannot affect with your television-watching. This is both a high bar and a low bar for fiction to clear. Also: The book should not explicitly contain material that reminds you of the election, and it should not be so highbrow that if you check your phone every 10 minutes (you are allowed to cheat, and will) you will lose the plot.</span>

                              <span>Imagine you are running the New York City Marathon, trying like hell to hold onto the group setting a sub–three hour pace.
You are ingesting disgusting energy slurry from gel packs, listening to Crazy Frog on your wireless headphones for motivation, and longing for your foam roller. You can feel sweat emerging from the soles of your feet. As you run north up First Avenue, you feel the ache set in, and you grit your teeth. You are off the pace, slowing, but you know you only have to endure 30 more minutes of pain. All of a sudden an electric Citi Bike, ridden by a guileless jackass in a yellow hi-vis vest, catches up to you, then a second electric Citi Bike, also piloted by a jolly dipshit in a yellow hi-vis vest, catches up to you. Through the throng of miserable souls, they are filming a hot shirtless man in tactical sunglasses, who is trying not to look at the phones filming him as he runs at 6:44 pace. You look around at your fellow runners to see if they are also seeing this trio when you drift ever so slightly into one of the electric Citi Bike cameramen, who sends you careening into the barriers and onto the deck. As you seize into a full-body cramp, you wonder what final product could be worth such debasement, and then you smile as you realize that because of the social media video content that ended your marathon, people will discover running and lead better, healthier lives. Your sacrifice was worth it.</span>

                              <span>It all comes back to the missed opportunity of 2016.
That year, of course, marked the biggest disappointment in the history of the San Jose Sharks—a loss in the Stanley Cup Final to the Pittsburgh Penguins. What could have been the culmination of nearly two decades as one of the NHL&#x27;s most consistent franchises instead left Sharks fans hanging yet again. While that generation of stars still managed to string together one last push in 2019, which ended in Game 6 of the Western Conference Final, it&#x27;s that failure eight years ago that continues to define San Jose&#x27;s identity.</span>

                              <span>Joe Few, son of Gonzaga men&#x27;s basketball coach Mark Few, has fond memories of hanging out courtside as a kid and asking his dad to put the walk-ons into the game. &quot;Don&#x27;t ever do that again,&quot; he recalled his dad replying in one instance involving a crowd chant for Rem Bakamus. Now Joe himself is one such walk-on. The redshirt junior has appeared in 29 games and averaged under three minutes per. With the Bulldogs up 36 points on Baylor in Monday&#x27;s season opener, Mark Few reasonably concluded that it was Son Time.
&quot;It might blow the roof off this place if Joe Few scores,&quot; said the ESPN commentator as Gonzaga set up its offense. Instead, Dusty Stromer&#x27;s lazy pass was picked off, Joe hustled back on defense to get in front of Baylor guard V.J. Edgecombe, and the two of them collaborated in the clearest possible visual representation of &quot;five-star recruit vs. coach&#x27;s son.&quot;</span>

Put simply, and to borrow a phrase from our Bakery Division, the Eastern Conference is made up almost entirely of warm, flaky ass. And it&#x27;s going to stay that way all year. Now that&#x27;s turgidity you can taste.
Now, we realize there have only been 108 games played so far over 11 days, which measures out to less than nine percent of the season. We know, too, that early projections do not necessarily indicate final results, as the gathering cadres of electoral fraud lawyers will make rancidly clear over the next several days. But the East has two teams, Cleveland and Boston, who are 15-1 and well worth your attention. The third best team at this moment by record is Brooklyn, which had to grind its gears audibly to hold off Memphis last night to get to 4-4. Memphis is also 4-4, a record that has more reasonably placed them in 10th place in the West.</span>

                              <span>Just days before the presidential election, the death of a gray squirrel named Peanut has become a somewhat inexplicable rallying cry for some of the worst people in the country. JD Vance claimed at a rally that Donald Trump was &quot;fired up&quot; about Peanut&#x27;s death. Elon Musk tweeted an unsettling AI rendering of a red squirrel (a different species) cloaked in Jedi garb with a quote attributed to &quot;Obi PNut Kenobi.&quot; On Nov. 2, the House Judiciary GOP tweeted &quot;Justice for Peanut.&quot; $PNUT is trending, and I refuse to learn what that means.
If you are a normal person, you might have not heard of Peanut and have no interest in learning who he is, in which case I wish you a peaceful and evolved day. But you are open to a light bit of brain poisoning in the name of knowledge, step inside, and let me explain how the saga of Peanut the Squirrel took over the internet and may or may not influence the 2024 presidential election.</span>

                              <span>Since their inception, food competition shows have seen very little real innovation. Most entries into the genre are variations on a theme, the stakes artificially raised through less time allotted, increasingly sadistic ingredient choices or semi-regular trauma dumps. There&#x27;s something deliberately anesthetizing in this; in the same way that I know a Starbucks sous vide egg bite will taste the same whether I buy it in New Jersey or Texas, I know what I&#x27;m in for when I turn on Chopped or Great British Bake-Off or Top Chef.
At first glance Culinary Class Wars, Netflix’s newest entrant into this gastronomical pantheon, looks to be yet another of these variations. There are familiar elements at play here; two celebrity judges, mystery ingredients and seemingly rigged team challenges make frequent appearances. But by the end of the first episode, it’s abundantly clear that the creative minds behind Physical: 100 and The Influencer have managed yet again to create a reality show with an elusive secret ingredient: novelty.</span>

Among the many failed decisions the soon-to-be-former Giants head coach made on what was a bloody awful Sunday for his home side, none were more noticed than Daboll’s bypassing extra-point kicks in favor of two-point conversions in the fourth quarter—not once, but twice. Daboll kept kicker Jude McAtamney on the sidelines, only to watch poor and poorly supported quarterback Daniel Jones muck things up both times, and see his team lose precious points in a 27-22 loss to the Commanders.</span>

                              <span>For many reasons, the São Paulo Grand Prix is my favorite weekend of any in Formula 1. The track is the best, or at least my favorite, on the ever-more-bloated calendar, and its traditional position towards the end of the season makes it appointment viewing any time there is a semblance of a title race. Throw in the possibility for rain, given that the race almost always takes place in São Paulo&#x27;s wet season, and the stage is often set for chaos, drama, and all-timer performances. The 2024 edition at the Autódromo de Interlagos might end up the most memorable weekend of all, if not for the pure quality on display, then for the sheer chaos that altered the schedule, upended the grid both before and during the race, and left the only man who could have won this race at the top of the podium, and within millimeters of another world title.
Let&#x27;s start with that man, Max Verstappen. While last weekend in Mexico brought out some of Verstappen&#x27;s worst impulses en route to a penalty-aided sixth-place finish that kicked Lando Norris&#x27; title charge and its corresponding narrative into overdrive, Sunday&#x27;s race was Verstappen at his absolute best. That&#x27;s not to say he had a great Sunday altogether; thanks to heavy rain on Saturday, qualifying was postponed to Sunday morning, under still wet conditions. Thanks to poorly timed red flag in the second part of qualifying, Verstappen was mired in 12th place for the start of the race, and a five-grid penalty, due to adding in a new internal combustion engine, pushed him further back to 17th. To make matters worse, Norris nabbed pole position, giving the McLaren driver hope of a not just a big points finish but also the possibility that Verstappen wouldn&#x27;t get many points of his own, shrinking the drivers&#x27; championship gap further.</span>

                              <span>The NFL is becoming weirder with every week. If you doubt that, let us present Saquon Barkley&#x27;s airborne rear end as the first thing you see when he and it sail over your head. It&#x27;s becoming too hard to keep up with all of the concussion-infused nonsense in this league, especially in a week in which two teams with one win on the season triumphed on the same day.
But then, just as your disorientation is threatening to swallow you whole, there are the Las Vegas Raiders. To call them a pillar of stability would be inaccurate, but damn if they aren’t reliable. Their gift for ass-backwardness (hello again, Saquon) is overwhelming, and after a loss on Sunday they defenestrated three of their most prominent offensive coaches—nine months after those coaches were hired, and nine games into the current season.</span>

                              <span>The hurdle only gained the Eagles five more yards, on a drive that ended with a field goal. But it was one of the weirder things you could ever see on a football field; until it happened, it wouldn&#x27;t have even seemed to be on the menu. It will be in Eagles highlight packages forever. Early in the second quarter on Sunday, Saquon Barkley took a pass from Jalen Hurts in the flat. He juked one defender to pick up a first down, then spun away from another. Now with his back to the end zone, Barkley jumped into the air and over Jacksonville Jaguars cornerback Jarrian Jones and landed on his feet. It was a play that had Eagles color commentator Mike Quick screaming. “It was the best play I’ve ever seen,” head coach Nick Sirianni said.
Eagles beat reporter Zach Berman wrote that down the line, this is the play you will first remember from this game. That makes sense, and not just because the play was unique and incredible. When the Eagles honored LeSean McCoy at halftime yesterday, they showed some of his runs in the Blizzard Bowl. Nobody remembered that the Eagles trailed 14-0 in that game, or that they gave up punt and kickoff return touchdowns. They only cared that the Eagles came back to win 34-20, with McCoy rushing for a franchise-record 217 yards. (People tailgating yesterday will probably also remember that Robert De Niro and John Kerry were there.) The Eagles beat the Jaguars on Sunday, although what was once a laugher came down to the wire. Barkley&#x27;s hurdle will be remembered a lot longer than that, and deservingly so.</span>

                              <span>Heidi Clements jolted me out of a glaze-eyed scrolling spiral one night a few months ago. A typical video of hers starts with her bending over toward her camera and then stepping back to reveal her starting point, a bra and pants. Then she builds an outfit while a voiceover shares a funny or heartbreaking or inspiring nugget of wisdom, like &quot;If you don&#x27;t ask for what you want, you probably won&#x27;t get it,&quot; and &quot;You may say you have nothing to wear, I say: just get dressed. Even if you have nowhere to go, just get dressed. Even if you don&#x27;t like how your body feels right now, just get dressed.&quot;
Clements has amazing style. It&#x27;s androgynous and playful, a little punk, a little Stevie, California-easy with a heavy silver chain or a black leather bag. Her arms are covered in tattoos and she has a shaggy haircut I&#x27;ve been trying to learn to cut via internet videos. Her nose is pierced with a silver hoop and she loves a red lip. She&#x27;s an influencer; she has more than 600,000 followers on both TikTok and Instagram and her manager&#x27;s information is in her bio.</span>

                              <span>In the second quarter of their game against the Cowboys, the Atlanta Falcons faced fourth-and-3 from the Dallas 36-yard line. What played out once Kirk Cousins got the ball snapped to him was a pristine example of two interrelated statistical probabilities coming true at the same time. The Cowboys&#x27; pass defense allows the most yards per attempt in the NFL, and had given up the second-highest number of plays of 40 yards or more even before Trevon Diggs tore a muscle in his calf. Falcons wide receiver Darnell Mooney, meanwhile, leads the NFL in receptions of 20 or more yards. As three Cowboys defenders bumbled into each other, with Diggs raising his hands in disbelief, Mooney ran into a pasture of space and sauntered in for an easy touchdown.
That play was one of the many embarrassments suffered by the Cowboys as they lost, 27-21, and fell to 3-5. Their year is less than halfway over and they already have as many losses as they had in each of the past three seasons. The football Mike McCarthy&#x27;s team is playing has him smashing tablets on the sideline, Ezekiel Elliott is only nominally on the team, and they have to play through a brutal schedule without several key players, including possibly Dak Prescott. The NFL&#x27;s highest-paid player hurt his hamstring on a run in the third quarter and was quickly taken out of the game, leaving Cooper Rush to see out the loss. After three losses in a row, things are suddenly looking dire.</span>

                              <span>The first five or so games of an NBA season can only give you so much quantitative data about how the next 77 or so will go—e.g. the Warriors might not be this great without Steph Curry because they have mostly played bad or injured teams; the Nets are not going to remain this competent, as Dennis Schröder will at some point miss a shot—but they are useful as qualitative exercises. Shots will go in or not go in at aberrant rates in the short term, which doesn&#x27;t tell you much, but the processes by which teams generate good shots and prevent their opponents from doing so tell you plenty. Some qualities, then, that the Milwaukee Bucks have shown through five games: unconnected, slow, stinky, creatively adrift, thin, and generally miserable.
The Bucks are 1-5, winners in Philadelphia on the second night of the season and then losers of five straight, with double-digit losses to the Bulls and Nets in there. They lost a heartbreaker to the Cavs on Saturday as Donovan Mitchell nailed a tough game-winner. The vibes are not great: Doc Rivers is all but openly wailing on the sidelines; Giannis Antetokounmpo is sitting through garbage time in a daze; Khris Middleton, who had surgery on both ankles this summer, has not played yet this season; Darvin Ham is on the bench; and the guy he brought with him from L.A., Taurean Prince, is giving quotes like, &quot;I just feel like defensively, our IQ has to go up.&quot; They are currently the biggest disappointment in the NBA, under circumstances that are not altogether that surprising.</span>

                              <span>All the issues that arise from the Ballon d&#x27;Or stem from misaligned expectations. Even after almost 70 years of footballers winning the thing, it&#x27;s still unclear to many what exactly soccer&#x27;s most prestigious individual prize is actually for. Is it meant to go to the single best player in the world? The best player on the best team? Should the winner have scored the most goals? Won the most trophies? How do you weigh club performances with national team ones? Does it even make sense to try to isolate and award an individual in what is an indivisibly collective sport? Is this whole affair so stupid, the criteria so unclear, the voters so random, the concept so flawed, that nobody should even care about it in the first place?
For better and for worse, the answer to all of those questions is &quot;it depends.&quot; Sometimes it&#x27;s easy, when the best player in the world wins literally everything for club and country and there&#x27;s no need for a multifactorial analysis. Other times, as was the case for the men&#x27;s Ballon d&#x27;Or this year, no candidate&#x27;s case is undeniable, and so you&#x27;re forced to wade into the subjectivity muck. It&#x27;s these non-obvious Ballon d&#x27;Or years that bring the controversy, but also make it more interesting by sharpening what exactly the award is getting at. And this year&#x27;s men&#x27;s BdO was one of the most controversial ones ever.</span>

                              <span>Hours after the Philadelphia 76ers lost at home to the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday night, news broke that Sixers star Joel Embiid dislodged Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes in some way during a confrontation in the locker room over a rotten, cynical piece of work Hayes published this past week. That is as determinate of a statement as can be made on the interaction, as the story broke via a series of confusing and contradictory reports that first characterized it as an assault. It doesn&#x27;t seem nearly that severe, but the NBA has confirmed it is investigating the matter.
&quot;We are aware of reports of an incident in the Sixers locker room this evening and are commencing an investigation,&quot; an NBA spokesman said. The public first became aware when Keith Pompey, in the most egregiously out-of-order manner possible, tweeted, &quot;Oh, boy, people will remember the Sixers season for all the wrong reasons. The team just dropped to 1-4 and Joel Embiid assaulted a reporter in the locker room.&quot; In a deleted reply to a fan asking for clarification of what exactly Embiid had done to the unnamed reporter, Pompey said Embiid &quot;punched him.&quot; Twenty minutes later, ESPN&#x27;s Shams Charania confirmed that an &quot;altercation&quot; took place, noting that Embiid took issue with Hayes&#x27;s latest and clarifying, &quot;Embiid shoved the columnist. No punch.&quot; Charania&#x27;s colleague Ramona Shelburne provided the detail that the &quot;shove was to the reporter&#x27;s shoulder.&quot;</span>
