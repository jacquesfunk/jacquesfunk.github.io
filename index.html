                              <span>If you find yourself on FEMA&#x27;s website, odds are you are already in a worst-case scenario. No one thinks of the Federal Emergency Management Agency except when their house has been reduced to a pile of debris and all the roads leading in and out of your city have been washed off the map. Or, for instance, when you see something on TikTok about the government corralling people in Florida and preventing them from evacuating ahead of catastrophic hurricanes. FEMA works almost exclusively in natural disasters, so there is a bleak logic to devoting pages on its website to fact-check a growing list of hurricane-related conspiracy theories.
&quot;FEMA is not blockading people in Florida and preventing evacuations,&quot; one of the entries reads. &quot;FEMA does not control traffic flow or conduct traffic stops, which are handled by local authorities. This is a harmful rumor that can put lives in danger.&quot;</span>

Kelsey is a crossword editor for The Atlantic (magazine). Erik is a crossword editor who has been in the Atlantic (ocean). The tallest person whose hand Erik has ever shaken is Ralph Nader, who is 6-foot-4, but he was sitting down. Kelsey has shaken hands with Artis Gilmore, who is 7-foot-2, and he was standing up! They hope you enjoy this puzzle however you feel most comfortable!

                              <span>BROOKLYN, N.Y. — I chuckled when I saw the words printed on the giveaway T-shirts at Finals Game 2 in New York on Sunday afternoon: “NOT DONE YET.” A kinder reading goes that all contenders think like this, no matter their situation. In the shadow of a Game 1 win, those words might have projected a noble kind of focus. We won’t rest on our regular-season laurels. Job’s not finished. Eyes on the prize. Giveaway shirt production lead times are probably not such that the Liberty ordered thousands of these to cope, anyway. But the shirts took on a slightly grimmer, funnier meaning in light of what actually happened in Game 1: an awful New York collapse. Now, methought the shirt doth protest too much. The “Our Season Is Definitely Not Over” T-shirt had people asking a lot of questions already answered by the shirt.
In a technical sense, it was true, though. The Liberty were not done yet. They still had a split to salvage in New York. And their home crowd, if volume was any sign, loved them no less for their choking. Fans might have felt a sense of déjà vu as the Liberty went up 17 points early, gutted through the second and third quarters, and then let the Lynx make it a one-possession game late in the fourth. But Breanna Stewart, she said afterward, was determined not to let “history repeat itself.” A determined Stewart is an awesome sight, and her arms made possible an alternate ending. Minnesota tried running back the small lineup that had worked for them in Game 1, but Stewart reminded them why it had always been a risky idea. She timed jumps like a defensive back to grab Minnesota lobs out of the air; she hung low to wreck entry passes and dribbles. After Courtney Williams skated past Jonquel Jones to make it a 68-66 game with 3:40 left to play, the Liberty ended the game on a 12-0 run. Stewart would finish with eight rebounds and a Finals-record seven steals, three of them in the fourth quarter.</span>

                              <span>BERLIN — My toenail ripped five miles ago and the pain is overwhelming. The looming dark skies make good on their threat as rain begins to sprinkle. The wind picks up. My heart quickens. I am in the middle of every rollerblader’s nightmare. All around, skaters skid and slow for fear of falling or colliding.
A few feet ahead of me, a far-too chipper man in a white helmet races up to a woman as she cautiously makes her way down the road, her legs shaking harder with every glide.</span>

The Greatest Show in Teal continued in London on Sunday and the Jaguars were decimated by the Bears to the tune of 35-16. Afterwards head coach Doug Pederson said his 1-5 team was on the verge of something. Greatness? Doom? 
&quot;We&#x27;re on a slippery slope, or right on the cusp of that slope,&quot; Pederson said. &quot;At some point we&#x27;ve got to [say] enough is enough, and you&#x27;ve got to have enough pride and figure out a way.&quot;</span>

                              <span>On Saturday, in three separate college football games, I saw a personal record three onside kicks recovered by the kicking team. Our once-beautiful and vibrant (OK, maybe it was never beautiful or vibrant) onside kick culture has suffered some real blows in the last year. The NFL effectively banned surprise onside kicks with its new kickoff rule, which allows onside kicks only in the fourth quarter and also requires the kicking team to declare they are onside kicking. But yesterday, these guys kept the culture alive. Let&#x27;s consider their onside kick strategies:

                              <span>The challenge of pitching is to stay unknowable—to keep hitters guessing, to never be timed up or figured out. By the end of the Tigers-Guardians American League Divisional Series, which featured a considerable number of relief innings even by the standards of postseason baseball, it did feel like these teams, who had met 13 times already in the regular season, were each becoming quite familiar with the other. The resulting sights could be something unfamiliar to fans: Detroit’s Beau Brieske, who hadn’t given up a home run off his fastball all season, serving up a go-ahead meatball to David Fry in Game 4; unhittable Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase allowing one less earned run in this series than he had all year. The threat of overexposure made each game feel extra tense. “It was such a fun series,” Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt said after Game 5 on Saturday, a 7-3 Guardians win. “Two very evenly matched teams going at it, and it was a lot of fun.” 
Though Cleveland’s path to the postseason wasn’t as bizarre as Detroit’s—the Guardians took first place in the division in mid-April and never relinquished it, despite scares from the Twins and Royals—they were both teams depending on run prevention. The Guardians offense cooled off in the second half, but the team stayed afloat thanks to an elite homegrown bullpen. An early-season injury to ace Shane Bieber, plus some underperformance from young arms, left the Guardians rotation in roughly the same [shrug emoji] shape as the Tigers’ heading into the postseason.</span>

                              <span>Earlier this week, the sun did its big one, producing the largest solar flare in nearly two decades. In its aftermath, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a severe geomagnetic storm watch for Thursday and Friday. This storm could not only temporarily disrupt power and radio signals, but also trigger stellar spectacles across the world known as aurora borealis.

                              <span>I bought the card in May of 2022. It was one of my many low-dollar purchases on eBay, made during one of my manic buying phrases; those tend to happen when I’m in a particularly good or particularly bad mood. “Stop buying things,” my wife will say when, say, a UK demo cassette of the song “Your Woman” by White Town arrives at the house. And I will reply, “But I’m in one of my manic buying phases when I am in a particularly good or particularly bad mood!” Eventually I toss the item in a box and forget about it, and then I try to remember to work on things in therapy and maybe ask for a medication tweak.
Anyway, this particular purchase was her fault for once. She was the one who told me about the card. Jan usually experiences sports vicariously through me, but she is a baseball fan. Our third date featured a long discussion about Bobby Estalella and whether he was the worst player named in the Mitchell Report. (Feel free to discuss in the comments.) So she knows a bit about sports cards. And one of the reasons we love each other so much is that she, like me, has a brain full of esoteric knowledge that could never, ever be useful in any scenario. Sometimes she tells me something wonderful and I just kiss her.</span>

                              <span>Standing in front of Sol LeWitt’s Wall Drawings, I felt my body go all fuzzy. My eyes followed the precise lines that crossed each other again and again, each on its own predetermined path but also existing as a component of the whole. Humble straight lines drawn in pencil or crayon, multiplied to such a dizzying degree that when you stand back, they blend together into a wiggling mass that comes into and out of focus like an optical illusion. I wanted to run my fingers over the lines; I imagined I would be able to feel the ridges they made in the wall, the way my handwriting does in my notebooks. 
It was the last day of summer, and I was visiting Mass MoCA for the first time with a group of my former coworkers. It’s been seven years since we all worked together, and in that time our relationships have cohered more into a family. There were 10 of us there that day, plus two babies, so once we started looking at the art, we broke up into groups based on our pace, interests, and whether we had a toddler to chase.</span>

                              <span>Major League Baseball has been broadcast regularly on television in North America for more than 70 years. By now, you figure it could be done pretty well. This is because humans tend to get better at things through repetition. You give me enough chances to learn and refine the doing of something, even something that involves wires and buttons and so forth, and I am going to be way better at the thing after a few decades at it. Recently I replaced my home&#x27;s wireless router, all by myself! From the accumulated experience of having occasionally replaced routers over the years, now you can just hand to me a router and, buddy, I am gonna install that sucker without dying.
Something weird seems to be happening with baseball broadcasts, however. Despite the basic requirements having changed roughly not at all over the course of most of a century—the game is still played on a diamond, you point a camera at it and press the &quot;on&quot; button, etc.—the people who produce baseball broadcasts are suddenly worse at the job. Not just in the sense of assigning the utterly joyless duo of Bob Costas and Ron Darling to the Royals-Yankees divisional series. That certainly sucked, yes, but something worse was happening in the other ALDS, between the Detroit Tigers and the Cleveland Guardians, also produced by TNT Sports (formerly Turner Sports). Here is the normal view of the action at a Tigers home game, taken from moments before the Tigers clinched their postseason berth, on Sept. 27:</span>

I was stressed. It was summer, and my dad was dying. On multiple occasions, I had to drop everything at a moment’s notice to go help my mom and siblings with him. I went back and forth so many times over the past few months, I genuinely lost count. I’d get a call or text, pack my shit, and then make the six-plus hour drive to Connecticut (one time I flew, just because I needed to conserve my energy) to do whatever was needed. Every trip could have been my last.</span>

                              <span>It is difficult, even the morning after, to know how to view the Los Angeles Dodgers&#x27; 8-0 shutout of San Diego in Game 4 of the National League Division Series. Was it an homage to the power of desperation? The triumph of an efficient system over individual excellence? Plain dumb luck replayed eight times in succession?
However you assign motive, let alone value, the Dodgers performed the rarest of feats on Wednesday night when they tied up their series on the strength of an eight-pitcher shutout. Rarer still, only one of those eight, Alex Vesia, faced more than five Padres hitters. Vesia was stretched out over the fourth and fifth innings in a 30-pitch marathon that had oldey-timey rememberers sighing over the recent death of Luis Tiant, the wonderfully idiosyncratic pitcher who threw a 155-pitch complete game in the 1975 World Series, three days after pitching a complete game shutout, all at age 34 and while celebrating every win with a cigar the length and girth of an adult spaniel. But that was then. This is the very opposite of that.</span>

                              <span>In 2019, the photographer Harris Narainen had just wrapped up a night dive off Anilao in the Philippines and begun his staggered ascent to the surface when his dive leader pointed a flashlight at something bright and yellow. Narainen looked over and saw a tiny shelled octopus called an argonaut, or paper nautilus, clinging to the candy wrapper as if it were a magic carpet. &quot;I was just too excited,&quot; Narainen wrote in an email. Earlier, the dive leader had mentioned they might see argonauts if they were lucky, and now here one was, sailing into the bright beam of light.
Although most octopuses live near the ocean floor and its ample hiding places, argonauts spend their entire lives sailing in the open ocean, just below the surface. This lifestyle has rendered the small cephalopods rather elusive to the scientists who wish to study them. &quot;Most observations on argonauts are opportunistic,&quot; Roger Villanueva, a marine biologist at Spain&#x27;s Institute of Marine Sciences, wrote in an email. In many of these serendipitous observations, argonauts are spotted clinging to some kind of substrate, such as a twig of driftwood or some gelatinous creature. But a traditional sampling net cannot capture these associations; the turbulence of retrieval will separate an argonaut from its trusty steed or entangle it randomly with another.</span>

                              <span>I wish that Major League Baseball gave out its MVP awards in the same way that high school movies dramatize the crowning of a Prom Queen—all the students watching rapt as an adult with an on-stage microphone calls the protagonist&#x27;s name. It&#x27;d be obvious how the NL MVP would go in any coming-of-age movie worth its salt: Shohei Ohtani humbly breaks off a piece of his tiara to give to Francisco Lindor, because he can&#x27;t bring himself to soak up the entirety of the recognition for himself.
Lindor&#x27;s all-around success at the plate and at shortstop this season had earned him an undisputed spot as the National League&#x27;s second-most valuable player well before Wednesday. And if it wasn&#x27;t already, his place in the hearts of Mets fans was cemented by the skin-saving sockdolager he levitated in the ninth inning in Atlanta to deliver New York a playoff berth on the day after the so-called last day of the season.
