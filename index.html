                              <span>My friend Sasha was banned for life from the Providence Place Mall when she was 20. She and her friends would sneak into movies at the mall’s theater through the maze of back hallways and tunnels. They climbed onto the mall’s roof. I imagine them like the subterranean ants in an ant farm: constantly scurrying, unseen and underfoot. 
The only thing deterring people from entering these halls was social convention. We live in a society. We don’t walk through doors with signs that say “authorized personnel only.” That is, unless you’re a young person with a palpable disregard for authority and the social conventions upon which our society is built.</span>

                              <span>Rafael Devers of the Boston Red Sox struck out not at all—not even one time—in Wednesday&#x27;s victory over the Baltimore Orioles. In the fifth inning, with teammate Cedanne Rafaela on first base, Devers timed up a 2–1 curveball from Zach Eflin and socked it down the right field line for a double! So his first hit of the campaign came in his team&#x27;s sixth game: Big deal! The point is that he is now in the hit column. Even better: The O&#x27;s sort of borked the relay, allowing Rafaela to come all the way around and score, giving Devers his second run batted in of the season (the other came on a bases-loaded walk). This was a nice moment: The relief was evident on our hero&#x27;s face as he grinned from second base. Three cheers for Rafael Devers!

                              <span>Losing, a permanent condition in bike racing, comes in many forms. On Wednesday at Dwars door Vlaanderen, Wout van Aert&#x27;s Visma team plumbed new depths and suffered one of the more embarrassing defeats you&#x27;ll see all season. They only could lose this big, this greedily, because they tried to win this big, this defiantly, which I think is something like admirable.
It all started after they&#x27;d rode themselves into a theoretically unloseable position. They led the peloton in reeling back the day&#x27;s early breakaway with 90 kilometers left, which sparked a frenzy of attacks. Mads Pedersen tried something and failed, a small group of riders tried something and succeeded and then failed, as Van Aert and three teammates broke clear from the peloton and leapt up to join and then shred that front group. It was an impressive display of team strength from a team whose capacity for such moves wasn&#x27;t as certain as it once had been. The trio unlatched everyone save for the young American rider Neilson Powless, and they raced on with nothing but 55 kilometers of clear pasture ahead of them. Who was going to catch them? Intermarché? Groupama? The chase had talent, but never organization. Also, the three Jumbo guys were all known cobble-eaters, only liable to be followed by especially rugged riders.</span>

I can smell you right now kid, and I have to say: I like what I’m smellin’. But I want more.

                              <span>On Sep. 19, 1994, a week before Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell declared that there was no legislative path forward in the current Congress for the Clinton administration&#x27;s healthcare reform agenda, NBC aired &quot;24 Hours,&quot; the pilot episode of ER. Set across a single day in an urban emergency room, the episode introduced a cast of medical professionals including John Carter, a medical student on his first day at Cook County General, played by a fresh-faced Noah Wyle. Wyle would be the last original cast member to leave the show, at the end of Season 11 in 2005, by which point ER&#x27;s status as the anchor of &quot;Must-See TV,&quot; the most watched night on television&#x27;s most watched network, meant less than it used to. 
The Pitt, which premiered in January and has its Season 1 finale coming up in a couple weeks, also begins as a new rotation of med students arrive at an urban hospital&#x27;s emergency room, and are shown around the ER by Wyle, now playing the senior attending physician, Dr. Robinovitch—&quot;Dr. Robby&quot; to his colleagues, and to us, a great TV name, the soothing childlike nickname of a competent, twinkly doctor crouching down to eye level to build rapport with a nervous young patient. Created by ER vet R. Scott Gemmill, the show also unfolds across a single day—an hour per episode, in subtly compressed real time—with numerous callbacks to the NBC drama, including a much-teased fakeout on the hospital&#x27;s helipad, and an emergency-room childbirth with complications which Dr. Robby is able to navigate more deftly than Carter&#x27;s old ER mentor did in that show&#x27;s most acclaimed episode. But The Pitt, unlike ER, is a streaming-only show, developed for Max, the Warner Bros. Discovery platform that evolved out of HBO&#x27;s on-demand service.</span>

                              <span>Val Kilmer died on Tuesday, April 1. He had been diagnosed with throat cancer years ago, and early reports are that he died after a bout with pneumonia. Too beautiful to be a character actor and too much of a weirdo to be the Hollywood leading man his beauty seemed destined for, Kilmer was nonetheless one of the greats. He saw himself as an artist, in all the messy and pretentious ways that term implies. But no matter what, you couldn&#x27;t look away from him. He&#x27;s been in a lot of great movies, and some bad ones too. In his honor, here are five movies I think best exemplify what made him such an exceptional star.

                              <span>The assumption, looking at the corpse of the Atlanta Braves in September, was that it could not possibly happen again. Bad luck doesn&#x27;t come around that often, and certainly never strikes twice. Projected standings may be able to hold firm, but early April is the season for baseball mortals to conduct their favorite activity: small sample-size thinking. Fifteen homers in three games means that the New York Yankees&#x27; torpedo bats need to be torpedoed into the moon; Mike Trout is starting to stink; 15 strikeouts in 19 at-bats is, well, admittedly pretty awful, there&#x27;s no getting around that. And, now, looking at a .000 win percentage over six games, simple math says that the Braves may not win another game this season.
It isn&#x27;t just the record. On Monday, MLB suspended Jurickson Profar for 80 games, after he tested positive for human chorionic gonadotropin. Sealing the suspension, Profar didn&#x27;t even file the customary appeal out of obligation. As pitchers&#x27; sudden resurgences could once be explained by &quot;He got into the special jam,&quot; a PED suspension provides a neat and tidy explanation as to how Profar had such an out-of-character season as a hitter last year, though it may lessen the charm of the story. It also explains the relatively slow offseason Profar had as a free agent, before the Braves handed him a three-year, $42 million contract in January—the only multi-year contract they handed out over the offseason. (According to David O&#x27;Brien at The Athletic, the Braves ascribed his performance to mechanical adjustments &quot;made with his lower body in his batting stance, after working out with Fernando Tatis Jr. and his dad the previous winter.&quot;)</span>

                              <span>On its face there was nothing unusually spectacular about Stephen Curry&#x27;s 52-point game last night at Memphis. He had 56 in Orlando 33 days ago, after all, and put up 60 a year ago in Atlanta. For all the references to his 54-point resumé-maker in New York twelve years ago, Curry’s best games have seemed to come south of the Mason-Dixon and east of the Mississippi. His last triple double—he went for a mere 52, 10 and 8 in Tuesday’s win over the Grizzlies—happened three years ago in Miami, just three days after his penultimate triple double in Charlotte.
And the spectacle of Curry&#x27;s latest attention-grabbing triumph lasted only a couple of hours; Nikola Jokic had 61, 10, and 10 later in the evening in Denver&#x27;s Russ-tainted double-overtime loss to Minnesota, a performance  outlandish enough to steer some of the shine away from yet another Curry fiftyburger. Some 40 players have scored half a hundred in a game 96 times in the last five years; Curry himself has done it nine times during that period. That’s more than any other player, so by these preposterous standards, Curry was...well, quite good but not necessarily OMG-able. It is a strange thing on the merits to be on the receiving end of merely a polite “that’s nice” after scoring 52 points on 31 shots, including going 12-for-20 from three, but Steph Curry does not get discussed on the merits. He gets discussed in relation to himself, which while meritorious enough still is a ridiculous yardstick. By those standards, this had all the feeling of, &quot;Oh, he did that, did he? Cool.&quot;</span>

No one can tell you that you were not chased through San Francisco by a pistol-shooting madman on Saturday night. It&#x27;s just one of those things a man knows for himself.
Deep Prasad, CEO of a Texas-based artificial intelligence company named GenMat, had this experience over the weekend. Not just that of fleeing a murderer&#x27;s gunfire through the witching-hour streets of San Francisco ...</span>

                              <span>It is a shame Russell Westbrook must be the first player mentioned in a blog about a 140-139 Minnesota victory over Denver that went to double-overtime and was perhaps the single most entertaining game of the season. That is what must happen, however, when such a game ends with one guy delivering the worst 17-second sequence of individual basketball anyone can imagine.
So let&#x27;s just start at the end: With 17.7 seconds left in the second overtime, the Timberwolves were preparing to inbound the ball while trailing 139-138. Anthony Edwards got the ball in the corner, and after being double-teamed made a hesitant pass that found nobody. Westbrook jumped on the loose ball and initiated a 2-on-1 fast break going the other way. He passed the ball to Christian Braun, who passed it back to Westbrook, who then completely duffed a wide-open layup. The Timberwolves grabbed the rebound with 10 seconds left, and after a wild scramble the ball found Nickeil Alexander-Walker in the corner. Alexander-Walker&#x27;s shot banged off the side of the rim as the buzzer sounded, but not before Westbrook, flying back into the play to contest the shot, fouled him. The refs put 0.1 seconds on the clock, Alexander-Walker went to the line for three shots, sank two, and the game was over.</span>

                              <span>Anything with the label of diversity, equity, or inclusion is under attack. Few arenas so closely tie DEI initiatives and athletics than parasports, for people with disabilities. From military-focused projects like the Invictus Games, to collegiate programs across the U.S., to the major funding disparities among international teams, the pursuits and careers of disabled athletes are just as much sociology and history lessons as they are athletics.
In the current, deeply destructive political moment, how are things going? I spoke to leaders at collegiate parasport programs and got the sense that they are in a holding pattern, hoping—perhaps vainly—that their sports will be insulated, while also being aware that their athletes stand to be affected off the court as well.</span>

John Taylor, whose literal job it is to make puzzles (for which he uses the titular pen name), gets a call from his sister-in-law (a delightful Anna Maxwell Martin), whom he has known since they were kids, who therefore also knows she has to send a cab hundreds of miles to pick him up and bring him to the university town of Cambridge where she lives, because otherwise he will not leave the house (she vows to match the exact meal she knows he’s having to make it up to him). 
She enlists John to pose as his brother, James, in order to infiltrate his detective agency and solve the mystery of how he went missing, but in the meantime, John keeps getting waylaid. Turns out his puzzle skills make him incredibly adept at solving crimes—of which there are a surprising number in such a small town—through swift deductive reasoning (and a lot of confusing number crunching), if not at entirely convincing his coworkers this new socially inept personality in fact belongs to the twin he is claiming to be. At one point in the second episode, James’s son has to be reassured by his mother that John is up to the job. “Your uncle is the most brilliant person I’ve ever known, there’s nothing he can’t do,” she says. A beat. “Actually that’s a lie, there’s a lot of things he can’t do, but he CAN do this.”</span>

Dave and Donald were walking around a lower-level concourse in the Veterans Stadium outfield. Bullpens at the Vet were behind the outfield wall in left and right. Fans were pretty high up, but they could lean over from the walkway above and get an overhead view of warmup tosses. Or do other things.
Dave and Donald were at a game in the early 2000s when they began doing one of the most popular of those other things, which was bugging Phillies pitchers. Donald wanted a ball or two for his kids, D.J. and Jack. I have attended dozens of baseball games with my uncle; I am sure the pair was annoying the heck out of Phillies relievers after a while.

                              <span>Touchstone Climbing is a behemoth of a gym network, spanning 16 gyms across California. Two of those opened within the past year with another currently under construction, as Touchstone seeks to consolidate its position as the premier place to climb indoors in the most populous state in the country, and surf various cultural and economic waves: the post-Free Solo climbing boom, the trend of younger people buying gym memberships at higher rates, and the increasing number of remote workers in search of some sort of third space.
It&#x27;s a smart bet, though quite a capital-intensive one, and all that levering-up is not without its pressure points. As Touchstone grows, so does the cost of a membership, which people have been happy to pay so far because the experience is worth it. But if multiple simultaneous construction projects and an expanded suite of offerings can be scaled up quickly, that speed only exacerbates the tension around the attribute that truly distinguishes Touchstone: the high-quality route-setting.</span>

                              <span>Aryna Sabalenka did something unusual in her Miami Open semifinal with Jasmine Paolini: She visibly acknowledged an error while a point was still live. Between points, anything goes in tennis. Players eviscerate their rackets, scream at umpires, spew abuse at their support team, or send tennis balls caroming around stadiums. But live rallies themselves are treated like a sacred space, free of even an eye-roll as long as a chance to win the point remains. 
It happened when Sabalenka, the best player in the world, was leading the first set 4-1 and nearing another break point. She had Paolini scampering with a forehand missile but put a little too much air under a drop shot, which Paolini spun into a lob over Sabalenka’s head. On replay, as Sabalenka sprinted to retrieve it and saw the ball land in, she was already grimacing at surrendering control of the point.</span>

                              <span>For three early minutes of Monday night’s Texas-TCU Elite Eight game, Texas led 2-1, and that might as well have been the final score. Certainly it was the game’s realest, most honest scoreline. Bothered by a tight, physical Texas defense, TCU could only reliably score at the free-throw line. The Horned Frogs would finish their 58-47 loss with just 12 made field goals on 45 attempts. A one-point difference felt both tiny and substantial. If Texas was playing twice as well on offense, that still wasn’t saying much. Against one of the better outside shooting teams in the country, the Longhorns were as loath to take threes as they have been all season, taking only three shots (and making two) from behind the arc. Things stayed close and nervy late into the third quarter—a 2-1 game, through and through.
Texas will appear in the Final Four for the first time since 2003. They’re set to play South Carolina, a staple of the Final Four by contrast and a conference rival the Longhorns have come to know well in the SEC regular season. The deep, shapeshifting Gamecocks present a slightly different challenge than TCU did. “If you cut that piece off, the rest of it dies,” Texas head coach Vic Schaefer said, referring to Hailey Van Lith, the glue of the Horned Frogs offense. To cut that piece off, Texas defended in layers: pressing up the floor and hard hedging the TCU pick-and-roll so that getting the ball even remotely close to the basket just seemed like a real chore. “Even if we didn&#x27;t get a turnover, we really made ‘em work hard to get it in. Then when they got it in, they had to try to figure out how to run some offense. I think we had ‘em pushed out on the floor quite well,” Schaefer said. Hailey Van Lith turned the ball over seven times and finished with just two assists. TCU’s 6-foot-7, seventh-year center Sedona Prince fouled out with six minutes to play in the fourth quarter, leaving the game with more fouls than points—and, a mark of how few paint touches Texas allowed her, more fouls than field goal attempts, too.</span>

                              <span>Asked if she ever imagined she’d reach her fourth Final Four in four years, Sania Feagin didn’t bother with pretense. “Yes, I did,” the South Carolina senior forward said. “I did because all they do is win here.” In Feagin&#x27;s four years as a Gamecock, the team has taken many shapes, winning with different players at the helm. Through it all, they’ve played with the easy, understated confidence of a favorite. More often than not, a favorite is what they’ve been. 
The Gamecocks head to Tampa later this week to play the winner of Monday night’s No. 1 Texas-No. 2 TCU meeting, for a trip to the national championship game. To get to this familiar place, they’ve had to spend some time in unfamiliar places. They’ve trailed with a couple minutes to play; they’ve traded big fourth-quarter buckets; they’ve made game-saving stops and clutched up late at the free-throw line. Last season&#x27;s title-winning South Carolina team came in waves, slowly but surely overwhelming opponents until the game was out of reach. Suspense expired at halftime. But with close wins over Duke in the Elite Eight on Sunday and Maryland in the Sweet 16 before that, the Gamecocks have shown they can also thrive on the ropes.</span>

                              <span>When Willson Contreras showed up for his first spring training as a full-time first baseman, he knew the learning curve would be steep. A year after he&#x27;d made over his catching mechanics entirely, a massive effort that earned some vinegary grousing from his co-workers and led to him getting his forearm broken on a catcher&#x27;s interference, Contreras arrived at camp ready to start all over again. He was notably bulked up, and spent hours throughout the first weeks of camp having Cardinals infield coach Stubby Clapp fire grounders at him out of a machine called The Red Rocket; Contreras&#x27;s brother William, a star catcher on the Brewers, &quot;told me when I told him I was switching positions...that I couldn’t be mean anymore and that I had to start saying ‘Hi’ to people.&quot;
Most of what Contreras was looking forward to about the move, though, came down to the fact that his new job would be less all-consuming than his previous one, which required him to go over scouting reports and work with his team&#x27;s pitchers. “I have plenty of time to do everything now,” Contreras told MLB.com&#x27;s John Denton in February. &quot;One of the biggest keys to being a good hitter is having time to reflect on an at-bat or watch video to make adjustments. Now I can talk about hitting, and it feels relaxing to have time to talk to other hitters and ask them questions.&quot;</span>

                              <span>In the bottom of the fifth of Sunday&#x27;s Braves-Padres contest, Atlanta pitcher José Suarez and his catcher Chadwick Tromp combined for a sneaky strikeout of San Diego shortstop Xander Bogaerts. After falling to a 3-1 count on a very low changeup, Suarez earned a called strike with a fastball that just barely caught the bottom of the zone. As his follow-up, he threw nearly the exact same pitch, just a tad lower. Bogaerts, again, didn&#x27;t swing, and fans crediting the virtual strike zone on TV would&#x27;ve seen that he made the correct choice to take the walk. But Tromp&#x27;s frame job, and Suarez&#x27;s ability to hit his spot, fooled the umpire into calling for a strikeout that ESPN&#x27;s machines informed us should never have happened.</span>

                              <span>If the Yankees hadn&#x27;t hit a record-matching 15 home runs in three games to start their season, the discourse around their torpedo-shaped bats would look very different. As it stands, the bats have spurred accusations of cheating and stories that contain the dreaded figure of a former MIT physicist, who is nicknamed Lenny and is &quot;the man.&quot; (Aaron &quot;Lenny&quot; Leanhardt, credited as one of the original evangelists of the bat, left the Yankees in the offseason and is now a coach with the Miami Marlins.)
To get it out of the way, the bats are entirely legal. If MLB&#x27;s confirmation of such wasn&#x27;t enough, official rule 3.02 states that a bat &quot;shall be a smooth, round stick not more than 2.61 inches in diameter at the thickest part and not more than 42 inches in length&quot; and &quot;shall be one piece of solid wood.&quot; What is different about the torpedo bat is not necessarily its barrel diameter, but how the wood on the barrel is distributed: Rather than the even taper that most bats have on the barrel, the torpedo bat moves weight from the top of the bat, where hitters do not want to make contact, to the sweet spot of the bat, which players gesture to as the best place to hit a baseball.</span>

                              <span>Rafael Devers is having a time. In Sunday&#x27;s loss to the Texas Rangers, Devers struck out twice and walked once in five plate appearances. First, the good news: The free pass raised his on-base percentage on the season. The bad news: His on-base percentage on the season is .111. The worse news: Through four games, Devers has not yet collected a hit. The heart-breakingly awful news: Devers has struck out in two-thirds of his 18 plate appearances on the season, making him the first major-league hitter in history to strike out 12 times in his team&#x27;s first four games.
It&#x27;s as bad as it sounds. Prior to this putrid, horrendous start, only five players since 1901 had even struck out 11 times through their teams&#x27; first four games, per the Boston Globe. Rob Bradford of WEEI culled some genuinely appalling metrics from Baseball Savant Monday morning, highlighting the depth of Devers&#x27;s struggles. The veteran has whiffed on a gut-churning 67.4 percent of his swings so far. No, he is not being particularly selective: Already, through four games, Devers has swung and missed at 31 pitches, 13 more than the next closest player in all of baseball, and that player (Teoscar Hernandez) has played an entire additional series. An unbearable 75 percent of the times that Devers has swung at a fastball, he has failed to make contact. I&#x27;m looking at Devers&#x27;s Statcast page right now and openly weeping: Pitchers have thrown him 48 pitches in the strike zone, and he has swung at 36 of these pitches, and those swings have resulted in three (3) batted balls. Someone needs to drape an arm over this man&#x27;s shoulder and just let him sob for a while. Be a friend!</span>

                              <span>Michigan State was going to lose, but 6-foot-5 Coen Carr was still hustling. He rushed through the lane, passing three Auburn players to fight for a rebound. Auburn’s Miles Kelly slapped the ball out of his hands, and the two ended up on the ground fighting for it. Eventually, Kelly and MSU’s Jase Richardson had dual possession. The referees signaled for a jump ball.
Because this was college basketball, that did not lead to an actual jump ball. Auburn got the ball because the possession arrow was in their favor, something the Tigers had because they won the opening tip. The possession arrow wasn’t needed in the first half, and so Michigan State inbounded the ball to begin the second. Auburn then had the possession arrow in its favor for the entire second half. Nearly 20 minutes later, that meant they got the ball after that late tie-up.</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s not much to be excited about when it comes to the 2025 Miami Marlins. I wrote about this in the Defector season preview, but these Fish stink. Sure, they have Sandy Alcantara back, and there are some prospects worth keeping an eye on, but a dour season appears to be on the books, along with yet another last-place finish in the brutal NL East. And yet, at the end of the first weekend of baseball&#x27;s new season, it is the Marlins, mighty and effervescent, sitting at the top of the division standings. They&#x27;re 3-1, an extremely temporary juggernaut of clutch hitting and historic walk-off wins.

How can a multi-million dollar renovation inspire you to make changes in your space? How can you make your apartment beautiful while still having money left over to pay the rent?

                              <span>Cooper Flagg got the ball at his own free-throw line with 4.6 seconds left. He looked up at the clock and sped down the court. Arizona was out of sorts in transition defense, and Flagg stopped behind the three-point line with a ton of space around him. He beat the buzzer easily. He’d hit a three on the previous possession, too. “We talk about inflection points,” said Kon Knueppel, who had 20 points in Duke’s 100-93 win over Arizona in the Sweet 16 last Thursday, “and the end of the half is a really big inflection point. So it was tie ballgame, and hit two threes gives us a bunch of momentum coming into the second half.” Flagg finished with 30 points, 6 rebounds, and 7 assists.
Flagg didn’t do as much in the Elite 8 win over Alabama on Saturday, but he also didn’t have to. Alabama-Duke had the look of a classic beforehand, and then the Blue Devils jumped out to a 15-5 lead five minutes in and were never really challenged in a 85-65 win. They put it away with a 13-0 stretch over five minutes late in the game. Flagg opened that run with an impressive one-hander after backing down AP All-American Mark Sears. He beat Sears again a few minutes later with a layup he basically shot sideways.</span>

Hence, the Detroit Pistons in this, the beginning of their latest renaissance, having to relearn everything here at the hinder end of the regular season. Since their last trip to the Eastern Conference Final in 2008, they have had the worst record in the NBA, their worst record in team history, the longest losing streak in league history, lost their last 12 playoff games, and in general been easy to dismiss—hence their persistent dismissal.</span>

                              <span>UCLA chose an odd way to muscle itself into its first women&#x27;s Final Four—by seeing its muscle get into early foul trouble and having her sit out the entire second quarter. This would surely be LSU&#x27;s moment as the very live and historically imposing three-seed in a tournament full of chalk.
Instead, the Bruins somehow managed to be better without center Lauren Betts than they were with her, as counterintuitive as that seems, building themselves a workable lead that they could then safely defend through the second half, when Betts returned to re-establish her place in the game&#x27;s highlight reel. In all, it was a structurally odd way for the Bruins to finally break through the bracket ceiling, but the final score of 72-65 was an accurate portrayal of the difference between the two teams.</span>

                              <span>Perhaps it was not a coincidence that on Friday night Alysa Liu wore gold. That&#x27;s when the 19-year-old took to the ice in Boston for this year&#x27;s figure skating world championships and made it all look so easy, like she never left figure skating (which she did), as if her victory had been assured all season (it was not). Skating to Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;MacArthur Park,&quot; Liu didn&#x27;t just land her jumps, she seemed to float. Her entire performance exuded ease and joy, without a stumble or slip to be found. When Liu neared the end of her routine with a gorgeous layback slide across the ice, the crowd roared. You know it&#x27;s a powerful performance when former Olympians Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir stop talking and just let the skating speak for itself. At one point, broadcaster Terry Gannon asked Lipinski if she believed what she was seeing. The Olympic gold medalist replied, &quot;I am not!&quot;
Even Liu herself was surprised, telling her coaches as she walked off the ice into a giant group hug, &quot;What the hell?!?&quot;</span>

                              <span>The AFC South has always been kind of a meh-stival—four under-noticed teams (just one media market inside the top 25) all doing relatively dull things (having the worst cumulative record since the division became an actual thing) and only very occasionally getting our attention for anything other than draft position. Thus it is with admiration as well as curiosity that we gaze upon the escalating uniform war between the Houston Texans and Tennessee Titans over the use of what the rest of us would just call light blue.
Or as the Titans call it, Titans blue. Or as the Texans call it, H-Town blue. Or as the rest of us call it, &quot;The Nothing Else To Do Battle Royal.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Jake Bauers looked history right in the eye and spat dead on its cornea. But that&#x27;s what great non-pitcher pitchers do. And when they do it on a late-model recreation of the biggest stage of all, it is all the more, well, more.
Bauers, the Milwaukee Brewers&#x27; backup first baseman, was looking Saturday morning at a relatively relaxing afternoon in Yankee Stadium. He wasn&#x27;t in the starting lineup and, if things went well, he wouldn&#x27;t be needed. Instead, it went galactically not. The Yankees started the game with three consecutive first-pitch homers off Nestor Cortes, a major league record for instantaneous pitcher abuse, and even then it seemed fair to assume that Bauers wouldn&#x27;t be needed for defensive or pinch-hitting reasons in a close game. But by the third inning, when 3-0 became 13-3, Bauers&#x27; availability became inevitability. As the Brewers&#x27; designated lost-cause pitcher, he has the responsibility of saving relievers&#x27; arms when a game is declared beyond redemption, and the Yankees had delivered the necessary conditions in near-record time.</span>

                              <span>The summer after I got married, one of my bosses bit me on the arm. I had a lot of jobs that summer, and a lot of bosses; at the time, I was recreating the sort of interchangeable, poorly paid jobs I&#x27;d had throughout my twenties in exhausting freelanced aggregate. The boss that bit me was the co-owner of a real estate agency that paid me more or less minimum wage to jam search keywords into apartment rental listings, write bios for their agents and copy for their website, and oversee whatever other writing or editorial work needed doing. There was a lot of that; unpaid college interns and international employees churned through the office nonstop, and their combined labor and movement kept the agency&#x27;s burgeoning online presence stocked with fresh spam. Agents came and went as agents do, as did various ostensible eminences—I remember one, after being told by my boss that I had written for The Wall Street Journal, excitedly launching into a speech about &quot;a disease called PC-itis&quot; like a child actor at an audition—and prayer group buddies and transient subletters and an intense Georgian named George, whom I liked and sometimes brought me strange Georgian desserts. It sucked.
When my boss bit me, I had just questioned his wish to include an easily disprovable lie in his bio, which I was writing on his computer, at his desk. I was shocked by the bite, but less surprised by the look on his face afterwards—he was flushed and eager, like a child that has just discovered how to be naughty, his eyes shining and a little wet. As with the cohort that generally does that sort of thing, which is weird little kids acting out in daycare settings, there was a question implied in that look—what would be the consequence for doing a thing that you are absolutely not supposed to do? In retrospect, I wonder if he was waiting to see if I&#x27;d hit him.</span>

                              <span>I was overly aware of my response the night I saw Moby-Dick at the Met. I don’t know the first thing about opera and, more worryingly, I’ve become known to friends as a person who won’t stop talking about the novel. Some of those people came with me that Saturday night, but no one really knew what to expect. 
Moby-Dick, originally adapted for opera in 2010 by composer Jake Heggie, is an American creation that was neither deemed consequential or groundbreaking upon its publication. Demonstrating the lives of many artists before and since, Herman Melville died in relative obscurity and with limited financial resources. The Moby-Dick opera premiered at the Dallas Opera nearly 200 years after the novel’s publication and has since toured around the country, from L.A. to D.C. The libretto is in English and its references, like the novel, pertain to the seafaring culture of northeastern America.</span>

                              <span>Less than a month before the NBA playoffs begin, the Memphis Grizzlies announced today that they have fired head coach Taylor Jenkins. This is fairly shocking news, for the timing and also because Jenkins was seen as rather entrenched in Memphis. He&#x27;d been there since the 2019–20 season, making him the fifth-longest tenured coach in the NBA. Jenkins was weeks away from coaching his fourth playoffs with the Grizzlies.
&quot;I&#x27;m genuinely appreciative of Taylor&#x27;s contributions to this team and this city over the past six seasons,&quot; general manager Zach Kleiman said in a statement. &quot;This was a difficult decision given the consistent and tangible development of our players and overall success under Taylor&#x27;s leadership. I wish Taylor the very best going forward.&quot; Kleiman and Jenkins were hired during the same offseason, so this is not a case of a GM dumping a coach inherited from a previous regime, but there were signs of unrest last summer. Kleiman oversaw a dramatic revamping of Jenkins&#x27;s staff, cleaning out the entire bench save for Patrick St. Andrews and Anthony Carter, each of whom had been hired just the previous offseason. In came six new coaches, including, most importantly, Finnish coach Tuomas Iisalo.</span>

                              <span>On a Friday morning in December, I found myself sitting on a bench outside a federal courtroom in Brooklyn. I was attending the sentencing of Carlos Watson, my former employer at Ozy Media from 2018 to 2020, because a curiosity had gnawed at me: Would he express remorse? What would he have to say for himself? 
Watson had been found guilty of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and aggravated identity theft by a federal jury in July. Now was time for his sentencing. I had experienced how disorienting it was to work for someone who routinely bent reality to match his will and beliefs. I was curious how it might feel watching Watson finally be forced to adhere to a judge’s reality and a jury’s findings—and potentially confront the consequences.</span>

In the first two installments of The Backlog, I looked at games that released in January of 2020. Part of this is because February was a bit of a dead month, and part of it is because I wanted to set the stage. The world was mostly normal that month, though there were already warning signs about the coronavirus. A botched remake of a classic game and a sequel to a long-running franchise ... those were the games that could make waves in a slow period for games. Now, though, we come to March of 2020, where things went off the rails very quickly.</span>

                              <span>The Chicago Bulls—I know! Listen, I know. It is March 28. Baseball has returned. Redbuds and daffodils are blossoming. Goldfinches are going yellow. There are better things to talk about, and even if there weren&#x27;t, there would be more serious things to talk about than this goofy-ass basketball team, which has been mired in miserable grinding sub-mediocrity for, Christ, a decade! Nevertheless, here we are. As I was saying: The Chicago Bulls—and really we are never going to get to the end of this if you can&#x27;t dispense with the whole groaning eye-roll thing, so please—are on one. It cannot be denied. These chaotic rebuilding bozos are currently shredding just about everything in their path. They&#x27;ve now won four in a row, and nine of their last 11. These are not horseshit wins: Over this run they have beaten seven teams that are currently in playoff position. Thursday night they beat the Lakers for the second time in five days; in between they exhausted and befuddled and totally worked over the Denver Nuggets.
That first win over the Lakers was an eye-popping beatdown, a 31-point destruction in Los Angeles against a would-be title contender very much motivated to reverse a recent swoon. The Bulls were out of their minds: Josh Giddey had 17 assists and eight steals; rookie Matas Buzelis put up a career-best 31 points; Coby White scored 36 on just 17 shot attempts. The Lakers were made to look dumpy and slow, and came to Chicago Thursday hoping for a better showing. Instead they spent most of the early stages of the game once again being made to look like old tired uncles, falling behind early and trailing the floppy-haired Bulls by as many as 13 points, and only scrapping back to within a possession in the final minutes before halftime. The game turned in the second half, and the Lakers built up a 19-point lead early in the fourth quarter. This was a win in-hand for a fairly desperate veteran team.</span>

                              <span>Whatever you want to call the current age of television, it is far from golden and far from the prestige era of the late aughts. Instead we have entered into some sort of silver age, where television has all the qualitative earmarks of the prestige era—fancy, though digitally glossy, cinematography, showy directing, big stars, elaborate stage production—but with the kind of story churn and writing that more resembles the kind of television I grew up on.
I&#x27;d compare present-day TV to the cable dramas of the late 2000s. Shows like the 911 series, Defector favorite Reacher, The Pitt, or the Taylor Sheridan and Tyler Perry television universes hearken back to familiar TV tropes of the 2000s, but with bigger names and often more elaborate filmmaking. I find this mostly refreshing. At the peak of the prestige era, it felt like television had forgotten something fundamental about its medium that separates it from movies—you spend more time with these characters and therefore they become members of your family, and you want to care about their stories and not just try and solve some overarching mystery the entire time. For every True Detective or Twin Peaks: The Return, there were a lot more Westworlds and Black Mirrors, shows that tend to fall apart when you&#x27;re no longer invested in solving their puzzles. TV should still be a little boilerplate, and should be more about characters than the story.</span>

                              <span>In a game from the gods, Texas Tech played its way into a not-so-sweet 16-point second-half deficit against Arkansas, then played its way out. And then some. The gutsy and fun Red Raiders used a late bank shot from Darrion Williams and some great last-second defense to beat John Calipari’s Razorbacks, 85-83, in the first overtime game of this year’s NCAA Tournament. Tech now advances to Saturday’s West Region final. 
Tech, the No. 3 seed in the region, fell behind early by way of an offense built around missed layups and missed three-pointers. Lots of Red Raiders had off nights. Star guard Chance McMillian, who hasn’t played since suffering what he said was an oblique strain in the early rounds of the Big 12 tournament, didn’t even dress for the Arkansas game. Senior guard Elijah Hawkins played all 45 minutes for Tech, but went 0-9 from the field in regulation, including 0-6 from three. Kerwin Walton, who had eight threes while putting up a team- and career-high 27 points a week ago in Tech’s tournament-opening win over North Carolina-Wilmington, was benched early against Arkansas and finished with zero points.</span>

                              <span>You can never be all that surprised when a team reverts to type. Yes, Real Madrid was fresh on the heels of the best week in its short history, having sealed two huge, potentially fate-altering wins. Nevertheless, this is still Real Madrid—talented but bumbling, ineptly managed, devoid of ambition, and disappointing as a rule. If the shock Clásico victory over the weekend, and the preceding 2-0 home win in the first leg of the Champions League quarterfinal tie against Arsenal, made for Real&#x27;s Cinderella moment, then the opening whistle of Wednesday&#x27;s followup match in London marked the arrival of midnight. Alessia Russo and her teammates were ready with the sledgehammers.

                              <span>If you know only one thing about Drew Magary, it is that he went on the Food Network show Chopped and won. If you know just two things, that additional knowledge probably involves one of his many acclaimed books or his long and successful writing career. But if you know a third thing about Drew it is that Bob Mould is his favorite musician. It&#x27;s a good choice, and in my opinion one that tells you something about a person. Mould is a one-of-one, a trailblazer and a punk rock legend who has continued to make ambitious, socially conscious, and extremely loud music over the course of five decades in a business with a short memory and narrow margins. I like his music a lot, too, but the person I just described is someone that I would, just given my own deep-seated sense of suburban uncoolness, be inclined to admire from afar. Drew, who is different, has not just set out to Meet His Hero but to have him on the podcast. And so, for a second time, we welcomed back one of the coolest and most admirable Americans of his era onto the podcast where we otherwise say &quot;pee pee&quot; and &quot;poo poo&quot; back and forth to each other.</span>

                              <span>LeBron James went on ESPN Sunburn Lord Pat McAfee&#x27;s show on Wednesday; while there, he said some mostly anodyne stuff about Michael Jordan and talked a little about his sons Bronny and Bryce. The parts of the interview that achieved escape velocity, though, were comments James made about two other ESPN personalities: Stephen A. Smith and Brian Windhorst.
Smith and James have been feuding for a couple months now, with Smith identifying that the concerned uncle angle is the most likely to provoke a reaction and being proven broadly correct, as James confronted him on the court after beating the Knicks on Mar. 6. &quot;If it’s one person that couldn’t wait until the video had dropped so you could address it, it&#x27;s your ass. Like, seriously,&quot; James said, to McAfee, of his courtside confrontation. He allowed that criticism was fine up to a point, &quot;But when you take it and you get personal with it, it’s my job to not only protect my damn household but protect the players.&quot;</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s not always easy to determine if and when a team has quit on their coach. Observers of the Philadelphia Flyers have no such uncertainty. After allowing six unanswered goals in Toronto on Tuesday, Philly&#x27;s 7-2 defeat was their 11th in the past 12, and only a couple of those losses featured anything positive to build on. This is rock bottom.

                              <span>When Veronica Correa started college at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, she knew she wanted to pursue some kind of science, but traditional paths—such as medicine or research—didn&#x27;t feel right to her. She sampled different classes, at one point signing up for a class about water management and human rights to fulfill a philosophy requirement. This class helped Correa realize she wanted to enter the environmental field, which combined many disciplines.
Correa&#x27;s interest in science was both personal and familial. Her parents are originally from Venezuela, where her grandmother worked as a biologist studying tropical disease and teaching at a university. &quot;I always thought it was really admirable what she was doing, especially starting her career in the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s in a time in culture when there weren&#x27;t a lot of women pursuing her particular field,&quot; Correa said.</span>

Ozturk, a Turkish citizen, is attending Tufts on a student visa.
Ozturk, who according to records from Immigration and Customs Enforcement is now being held in a detention facility in Louisiana, is now threatened with deportation despite not having been charged with any crime.

Where was the harm in the Houthi PC small group scandal?

We mention it only because we had our annual draft Tuesday, and because our reckless mention of the fact that this is the league’s 54th season led to us being hectored into writing about it by several members of Defector&#x27;s Baseball Bastardy Brigade (and they know who they are). And that is probably all the detail you need, because Rule The First of fantasy drafts remains in force, and that rule stipulates that you must keep your fantasy team to yourself. Your designated typist has been assured (and when we say &quot;assured,&quot; we mean &quot;threatened&quot;) that there is an exemption for fantasy leagues that predate the first appearance of a high-five on television.</span>

                              <span>Starting a new team in an organized sports league is hard, and that&#x27;s after you round up the money to bribe all the other rich people that you’ll need to join the group. There is also the vital matter of the team nickname, which is how and why we have arrived at the Boston Lega . . . Leg . . . Llllll . . . nope. Can&#x27;t do it. Don&#x27;t even want to try. It&#x27;s not worth taking seriously on any level, with all due respect to the people who delivered it. Those people did their best, twice, which is the troubling part. You only get one chance to get a nickname right, and you can&#x27;t get it back no matter how many do-overs you ask the audience to allow in search of that one chance.
The new NWSL franchise in Boston has unveiled their official do-over after the hilarious yet horrific BOS Nation debacle, and credit where it’s due: they started well enough with their choice of Sharpie Highlighter Green as a team color. Green is an underused and therefore fine idea; the color has been an out-of-fashion athletic choice since organized sport began, on both sides of the gender, geographical, and even oceanic barriers, and even now green is used in barely 10 percent of the college and pro teams in the major sports. The praise sadly must end there.</span>

                              <span>I’m gonna tell you a dirty little secret about the Pittsburgh Steelers: they don’t care about winning another Super Bowl. They have a coach who can win nine games a year with just weeds and garbage, a name brand pass rusher whose jersey will keep selling long after he’s retired, and a full stadium every home game. That’s Steelers-y enough for the Rooney family. They don’t need anything more than that to be content. And that’s good, because they just lost their other starting quarterback from 2024.
While the New York Giants are putting the finishing touches on their three-headed Herb-erus of a QB room, the Steelers have opted to go in the opposite direction by doing nothing at all. The only QBs they currently have rostered are a pair of nobodies in Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson, and their highest pick in the upcoming draft is 21st. If this were any other organization—even the Titans!—there would be a giant red siren flashing over team headquarters, and the franchise’s scouting department would be urgently canvassing the nation to measure the hand side of every would-be quarterback out there. This is the NFL. You need a quarterback to live. I believe Itchy explicitly told Scratchy this once.</span>

                              <span>In 2018, I went to Pompeii. I did not particularly want to go to Pompeii, but we were on vacation in Italy, and my partner wanted to go, and so I obliged. We could eat in Naples, I reasoned. Then even if I did not have fun in the hot sun amongst the rocks and ruins of an ancient town, I would still be happy. But I was wrong; I enjoyed it. How do you not fawn over a perfectly preserved mosaic floor laid carefully in the entryway to a opulent home almost two thousand years ago? How can you not need to catch your breath at a still-standing arch that has been excavated from thousands of tons of debris that buried it after a volcano exploded?
The only thing I did not like about Pompeii—besides the heat—was that I was denied full access. There was a whole-ass vineyard behind some very high walls that I was not allowed to touch, and worse, whole sections of the city were still roped off because archeologists were still painstakingly uncovering them. I respect science, and understand that they need excavations to abide by certain rules to make sure that everything stays as unbroken as possible. But also I went to the wrong entrance of Pompeii and wandered around without a map, and saw the sections I was not allowed to enter and it pained me. I wanted to go back there! I felt the pull of curiosity. And now I know why: There was a glass brain.</span>

                              <span>Soccer in Spain is defined by the rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona. It&#x27;s what stirs Spanish hearts (one study found that some 57 percent of Spaniards support either Real or Barça), captivates the world&#x27;s imagination (El Clásico is hands down the biggest rivalry match on the planet), and therefore drives the attention, passion, and economics that are the lifeblood of the sport. What Spanish soccer is, it is in large part directly due to Real and Barça.
As should be evident by now, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sides of the sport are two inextricably linked aspects of the same entity. Much of the history of women&#x27;s soccer can be told by measuring the gap between the two at any given point in time, success always found in the places where the chasm wasn&#x27;t quite as wide as elsewhere. The future of the sport is in shrinking that margin further still.</span>

                              <span>William Kim’s TikTok videos should not be popular. They are long, sparsely edited, and lack music or text that might hold viewers’ attention. Most of his videos start with a defiant and absurd statement: “This is my food. My food is me.” His first video, posted on January 30, 2025, has almost six million views. 
I first saw one in early February, not long after the TikTok ban was temporarily reversed in the U.S. My feed tends to be full of fashion theory and celebrity gossip, so the minimal editing of Kim’s video felt distinct and interesting.</span>

                              <span>The race reports following each of the past 29 editions of the men&#x27;s Milan–San Remo, the first monument classic of the cycling season, are more or less identical, save for the proper nouns. The peloton races down from Milan onto the coast of the Ligurian Sea for like six hours and, after being softened up by all that racing through foreboding spring conditions and one ascent of the Cipressa around 20 kilometers from the line, the race is decided by the ascent and descent of the Poggio, a sinuous and otherwise unremarkable climb made totally decisive by all that softening up. Oddly, the race&#x27;s structural predictability (matched only by La Fleche Wallone) lends itself to an unpredictability of outcome. You never knew who will win, but you know how they will win.
That is, until this past weekend&#x27;s men&#x27;s race, which not only ended with Mathieu van der Poel repeating his 2023 triumph, but saw a wholly different kind of finish. It was the best Milan–San Remo I&#x27;ve seen in my time watching pro cycling, a testament to the greatness of both van der Poel and Tadej Pogacar, and the possibility of their rivalry.</span>

                              <span>Look, we are nearly finished with this 12-week-long odyssey into unlocking our inner artist and we&#x27;re all just ready to be done. Surely next week we&#x27;ll have more eloquent things to say about this three-month journey into the heart of our creative souls. Or, perhaps, we will be so broken and filled with dread that even the promise of being among the proud few to actually complete the The Artist&#x27;s Way will not fill us with joy. For now we&#x27;re trying to get through the last few days of morning pages. 
Will this next week mark the beginning of our new lives as enlightened artists? Will one (or many) of us burn the book when we&#x27;re done? Will the next time you see us be on a Broadway stage? Only time will tell.</span>

                              <span>The funny thing about getting invested in the race for the wild card is that, by definition, none of the teams involved are very good. Montreal is improbably clinging to the last playoff spot in the East right now mostly because they&#x27;re not losing in regulation. The Islanders, with their minus-16 goal differential (better than Montreal&#x27;s!), are right behind them for similar reasons. The Rangers have lost seven of their last 10. The Blue Jackets just ended a six-game skid by squeaking one out against the Isles. And finally, before we reach the completely unsalvageable wreckage, we have the Detroit Red Wings, currently experiencing the comedown after the coaching-change hot streak that rocketed them back into relevancy around New Year&#x27;s.
The Wings, last among the not-good teams, are really not good. They tricked people into thinking they might be when they ripped off a couple of seven-game win streaks in close proximity, but this is a squad that still hasn&#x27;t found a goalie solution, has struggled to make smart veteran acquisitions, and is stuck waiting on talent development to usher in a turnaround. Since the end of the international break, they&#x27;ve plummeted down the standings, and entering Monday&#x27;s first-ever franchise trip to Utah they&#x27;d won just four of their last 14. Facing the Hockey Clubs—another group that badly needs to scrounge up some points to sneak into the playoffs—the Wings, honestly, turned in another poor performance. But despite barely getting the puck on net, a couple of silly/frustrating goals delivered them the worst-looking 5-1 victory I&#x27;ve ever seen.</span>

                              <span>Over the course of nearly a decade, Gisele Pelicot of Mazan, France, was drugged and raped by her husband and as many as 83 other men he invited to do so. Presented with the option to prosecute the case privately, Gisele instead insisted on a public trial. Sophie Smith writes in an essay for The London Review of Books: “Her hope – and in this she is not alone – is that by publicising the behaviour such a society produces, the trial will be a step towards changing it.” The accomplices of Gisele’s husband, Dominique, variously admitted their guilt or rejected the use of “rape” outright. Several men repeated the line, “I am not a rapist,” with added justifications that Gisele must have known what was happening, that it was all a game, that she actually wanted the encounter to happen. “Liar, slut, loudmouth, killjoy: as is often true of rape trials, the best defense is one able to transform the victim into a contemptible Medusa, to make of the accuser the accused,” writes Jamie Hood, author of the new memoir Trauma Plot, in a recent Bookforum review of Virginie Despentes’s novel Dear Dickhead that begins with Pelicot’s trial. 
In Trauma Plot, Hood delineates her experience surviving three rapes through a prismatic formal lens. Each chapter of the memoir switches from a first, second, or third-person perspective, charting Hood’s time in grad school in Boston and her subsequent relocation to Brooklyn, while also weaving in threads from her childhood. But time, in Hood’s hands, is anything but linear. Hood destabilizes what might be deemed the tidy story of rape and gendered violence, the narrative that claims narrative is even a suitable form with which to contain trauma. “Everywhere I went, rape followed. Rape was the little phrase repeated through the score of my life.”</span>

                              <span>Thanks to some serendipitous scheduling, Manchester City and Chelsea are three-quarters of the way through a four-game series that started on March 15 with the League Cup final. It will end this Thursday, with the second leg of a Champions League quarterfinal tie. So far, this is a series that&#x27;s shown us the best of what the WSL has to offer.
It takes high-quality players and high stakes to turn a quirk of the schedule into a season-defining series, and this one has loads of both. For Chelsea, the WSL&#x27;s undisputed hegemon, these games presented an opportunity not only to continue their pursuit of a multi-trophy season, but to put Manchester City back in its place. Chelsea has failed to win the WSL title just once in the last eight seasons, but were pushed to the brink by City last season, which ended with Chelsea claiming their fifth consecutive title, but only on goal difference. For City, these four games brought with them the opportunity to salvage what is a season gone awry. City currently sits fourth in the WSL table, having regressed so far from last season&#x27;s heights that they are 15 points behind Chelsea at the top of the table and seven points out of the Champions League places. And yet, 12 straight days spent as Chelsea&#x27;s biggest obstacle to completing the treble left plenty to play for.</span>

                              <span>The Los Angeles Lakers dropped a game to the Magic Monday night, 118–106, in Orlando. There are worse things. The Magic are experiencing a rare patch of reasonable health, and in an otherwise nearly lost regular season they&#x27;ve managed to hold their heads above water at their home arena. Losing stinks—Nuke LaLoosh would say it&#x27;s, like, worse than winning—but for the Lakers this is just a loss. Rub some dirt on it, I say.
Far more troubling was the home loss Saturday night to the Chicago Bulls. This was supposed to be a get-well game, with LeBron James returning to action following a seven-game absence to tend to a groin injury. The Bulls aren&#x27;t exactly food, having now won 10 of 15 to pull into the East&#x27;s ninth seed, but that&#x27;s a second- or third-rate basketball operation over there, on the precipice of another gruesome rebuild, and the Lakers think of themselves as contenders. With James returning, and in the final game of the last significant homestand of the season, and with designs on righting a recently wayward ship, you would expect the Lakers to make a statement against so measly a foe. Instead, the visitors summarily karate-chopped the Lakers&#x27; buttcheeks to hamburger, in a drubbing so severe that Bronny James was given almost seven minutes of supervised sandbox time (naturally he missed all four of his shot attempts). The guys who shredded the Lakers are just guys: Coby White put up 36 points on 17 shots; Josh Giddey came two steals shy of a goddamn quadruple-double, and posted 17 assists to just two turnovers. Matas Buzelis (in fairness, he might someday become more than a guy) went for a career-high 31 points.</span>

                              <span>George Foreman could take a punch. 
Foreman, who died Friday at his home in Houston, was better known for other things. Like, most obviously, throwing a punch. He’s remembered as one of the hellaciousest hitters the sweet science ever saw, and his ring record (76-5 with 68 knockouts) and lots of YouTube highlights bolster that. The uninitiated can and should watch him seemingly lift Joe Frazier off the ground with a shot in 1973, or send former great white hope Gerry Cooney into retirement for good some 17 years later, or transport Michael Moorer to LaLa Land in late 1994. And outside the squared circle, Foreman famously shilled no-frills grills, and named all five of his sons George.</span>

                              <span>JuJu Watkins will miss the rest of the NCAA tournament with an injury she sustained in USC’s second-round game against Mississippi State, the team announced late Monday night. ESPN’s Shams Charania reported that the sophomore guard tore her ACL in her right knee. 
Watkins was carried off the floor by trainers just five minutes into Monday night’s game. To fans of Watkins, the sequence before the injury might have looked familiar. Her transition burst, and her rarer ability to change pace—to decelerate—make her one of the best players in college basketball. On a fast break in the first quarter, she seemed ready to bring both skills to bear against two defenders. But as the Bulldogs players caught up to her on the other end of the court, and as she tried to stop and swerve around them, Watkins fell and screamed in pain.</span>

                              <span>Chinook salmon start their lives high upstream in the rivers of western North America. The young fish linger in the safety of freshwater until they are big enough to head out into the open ocean, where they can live for up to five years. At sea, the salmon shine blue-green and glint silver. When the fish head back upriver, however, they flush into warmer hues: olive browns, reds, and purples. The jaws of the males lengthen and hook. The salmon almost always return to the exact stream in which they were born, following the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field like a compass. There, the salmon meet, mate, and prepare to die.
At this stage of the salmon&#x27;s life, they become &quot;gruesome zombie fish,&quot; said Sara Hugentobler, a fish biologist who worked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the hatchery evaluation program in Red Bluff, Calif. &quot;They&#x27;re losing scales. They&#x27;re losing tissue. You can see exposed bone.&quot; But this orgy of death leaves behind a bounty of carcasses—a buffet for bears and other scavengers. And whatever flesh, bone, and scales remain sink to the riverbed and become fertilizer for more life. &quot;They&#x27;re a really important ecological part of the environment,&quot; Hugentobler said.</span>
