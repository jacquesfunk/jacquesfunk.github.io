                              <span>So let&#x27;s get this straight. It&#x27;s taken roughly eight months to find out that the Arizona Coyotes blundered their way to Salt Lake City, screwed around with no team nickname at all (&quot;&#x27;Utah Hockey Club&#x27; my self-righteous arse&quot; seems a helpful phrase in this context), and after all that, we find out that they can&#x27;t use the obvious choice &quot;Yeti&quot; because those corporate swine with the camping equipment and highfalutin&#x27; drinking vessels are claiming copyright infringement? We&#x27;ve sat through 50 games of them playing mediocre hockey (24th of 32 teams, barely better than the Detroit Red Wings) in a glorified closet and a collective alias and now we might not get Utah Yeti?
Hardly worth the bother of caring any more now, is it? Might as well dress them in mauve and pewter uniforms without names or numbers and call them the Utah Undifferentiated Latter-Day None Of Your Business Blandburgers, if that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to get.</span>

If the average Defector reader isn&#x27;t interested in a blog about a midseason blowout featuring two teams outside of the playoff picture, well, too bad. Go write a Becky Blog, or whatever your name is. Because I need to record this for posterity. Tuesday night, I had the best seats I&#x27;ve ever had to a hockey game in my life, and I saw a Matt Rempe goal. May as well tell me not to blog a total solar eclipse!
Thanks to benefactors who shall go unnamed, because I don&#x27;t know Lauren&#x27;s parents&#x27; names, a Defector contingent of two attended a 5-0 Rangers win over the Senators that felt even more lopsided than that thanks to two disallowed New York goals. We were directly behind the Ottawa net, four rows back. (I spammed our work chat with semi-blurry photos of local sentimental favorite Artem Zub. &quot;Whoa,&quot; responded Samer with rude and uncharacteristic sarcasm. &quot;Big game,&quot; responded Ray with fully characteristic sarcasm.) Lauren, with typical Red Wings fan bravado, taunted me about the sub-Cup banners in the MSG rafters—the &quot;mere&quot; division titles, the Billy Joel sellouts, the fucking Phish banner.</span>

                              <span>On Dec. 4, president-elect Donald Trump announced that Bush-era Securities and Exchange Commissioner and former FTX advisor Paul Atkins would reprise his old role in the new administration. The next day, the price of a bitcoin exceeded $100,000 for the first time, a clear sign that the fourth cryptocurrency boom was on and that the incoming Trump administration would make good on his campaign promises to loosen the industry&#x27;s regulatory reigns. The days of federal skepticism and persecution were over. The industry rejoiced. Its planet-killing money laundering apparatus would finally be legitimated.
Amid the broader horrors unveiled over inauguration weekend, Trump also launched a pair of memecoins; by the time the former crypto skeptic was inaugurated a few days later, the fully diluted value of $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens had stabilized near a combined $44 billion. Instead of getting what they wanted on the first day of the Trump presidency, the crypto traditionalist wing got surprised. Many of its members were furious, with Mark Cuban worrying that &quot;people will think memecoins are the foundation of the crypto industry,&quot; and Lead Lag Report&#x27;s Michael Gayed decrying &quot;a general level of disgust&quot; with the launch. &quot;I do believe this puts into question some of Trump&#x27;s credibility when we have a president-elect enrich himself just before inauguration and make a mockery of an entire ecosystem,&quot; Gayed told the Wall Street Journal.</span>

                              <span>The lower third of Washington D.C., as you&#x27;d expect, was thick with MAGA folks over the weekend. Food trucks parked along the north curb of Independence Avenue Saturday afternoon pumped great-smelling fried stuff to euphoric blonde types in the usual assortment of tacky Trump gear. Big corn-fed-looking college-aged bros clustered at crosswalks, even smirkier and chestier than usual.
The generally delightful cafe in the lobby of the Hirshhorn Museum was clogged with shiny-faced weirdos in American flag sweaters and white and gold caps proclaiming &quot;Donald Trump Was Right About Everything,&quot; milling around near a window and waiting for their various lattes. The exhibit one floor down from the lobby was titled Basquiat x Banksy, and featured Jean-Michel Basquiat&#x27;s gorgeous Boy and Dog in a Johnnypump, over which Banksy had contributed Banksquiat: Boy and Dog in Stop and Search, with his usual thudding anti-subtlety. The exhibit is funded in part by conservative billionaire investor Kenneth C. Griffin, who purchased Boy and Dog in a Johnnypump in 2020 for more than $100 million, the same year that he threatened to move the offices of his hedge fund out of Illinois in protest of a graduated income tax.</span>

                              <span>I am so embarrassed of myself, constantly. 
My memories of the person I’ve been fuse into a rat king caricature version of myself—someone way too loud, way too presumptuous, with no idea how little she knew. The further back in time I go, the more certain I am that I was a jerk, and hopelessly mired in the miasma of my mental illnesses and ambition, stumbling through delicate interpersonal dynamics with the grace of an elephant. For that reason, I don’t often open my past journals.</span>

                              <span>The name Kluivert carries a lot of weight in Dutch soccer. Patrick Kluivert is one of the top scorers in the national team&#x27;s history, and he spearheaded the Oranje attack at the 1994 and 1998 World Cups, where the Netherlands reached the quarterfinals and semifinals, respectively. This is all to say that when Kluivert&#x27;s son Justin came up through the famed Ajax youth system last decade, people paid attention.
The younger Kluivert might have had the name and the developmental pedigree, debuting at the age of 17 for Ajax&#x27;s senior side, but he didn&#x27;t quite have &quot;it&quot; in the same way his father did. The early promise of his Ajax years earned him a €19 million move to Roma in 2018, but his progression soon stalled. A couple unexceptional Serie A seasons were followed by loans to Leipzig, Nice, and Valencia, but the former wunderkind&#x27;s star looked to have already faded. When he moved to Bournemouth in the summer of 2023, there was surprisingly little noise made about a player once surrounded by so much buzz.</span>

                              <span>We expect coaches and managers to be megalomaniacs; it is something like a function of the job. We also expect them to be full-on pathological liars, emotional manipulators, self-absorbed bullies, and dictators, and in general people only appreciate them for that once they&#x27;ve been fired. Often because they are fired. It’s complicated. See Nick Sirianni for further elucidation.
So when we say that Manchester United&#x27;s still new-ish manager Ruben Amorim is seeking out weird new territory, we&#x27;re saying something. Amorim not only says this is currently coaching the worst Manchester United team ever (which is historically inaccurate), he also says that he is actively hurting the team (which might be part of the design). He is just eleven games into his tenure and is already blowing up the job, himself included.</span>

                              <span>When I was a kid, like a lot of kids in the ‘80s, I had a View-Master. I had a few View-Masters, actually. You may have seen them before—they were these little red camera-looking things, with what looked like a visor in the middle and a little orange lever on the side. They were a kind of mini-photo projector. When you bought them, you also got a bunch of little round cards dotted along the edges with slides. The card fit into a slot, and every time you pushed the lever, a new slide would pop up with a new image. It made a satisfying click sound. I remember having an E.T. one, but they also had cards for television shows and toys. Mine were all movies. It wasn’t like watching the film, but it was kind of 3D and it was better than reading a short interview in some teen magazine, which is all you could really get in those days if you were a kid looking for more engagement with your favorite movies (VHS tapes rarely had special features). The images passed by one after the other, as you flipped through, retelling the story in distinct parts. It was full of holes, but it hit important notes, like Gertie kissing E.T. over that flower. Your memory of the movie itself filled in the blanks.
View-Masters first came out in 1939, on the back of high-quality color photos. But they weren’t that different from Eadweard Muybridge’s projected discs of The Horse in Motion from 1878. Considered to be the first bit of proto-cinema, the photographer’s glass discs, dotted with images of a horse in various stages of gallop, were cycled through an early version of the movie projector that he called, for obvious reasons, a zoopraxiscope. The whole thing came less out of artistic aspiration than scientific inquiry—a man just wanted to know what position a horse’s feet actually went through when it moved really fast, which was hard to see with the naked eye. Muybridge captured the motion, but also the parts that made it up; movement through time was important, but the individual images were too.</span>

                              <span>Connor McDavid is having a quiet season by his standards, which means he&#x27;s got 65 points in 43 games—ho hum. He&#x27;s still the scariest person on the ice with the puck on his stick, and if an opponent can take him out of a play at the cost of one of their own, there&#x27;s not a player alive they wouldn&#x27;t make that trade for. Unfortunately for McDavid, &quot;superstar calls&quot; in the NHL work the opposite way—less skilled defenders are more or less allowed to harass, pester, and otherwise torment the league&#x27;s most talented skaters, right up to and slightly past the line of a foul, because officials simply won&#x27;t call the rulebook to the letter if it&#x27;d mean whistling a penalty every seven seconds. It&#x27;s enough to frustrate anyone into cross-checking Conor Garland in the face.
In the wild closing seconds of Vancouver&#x27;s 3-2 win over Edmonton on Saturday, Garland took it upon himself to remove McDavid as a threat. Keep an eye on them during the last-minute barrage in the Canucks&#x27; end: Garland pulls McDavid to the ice and holds his arm so he can&#x27;t get up. McDavid throws a punch, gets to his skates—and is promptly wrapped up and dragged down a second time. That was enough for him. After getting to his feet again, he delivered a cross-check to Garland&#x27;s grill. Can&#x27;t do that.</span>

                              <span>The Ohio State Buckeyes are the national champions of the 2024 college football season, and victors of the inaugural 12-team playoff. The Buckeyes dismantled Notre Dame, 34-23, and despite a valiant effort by the Irish in the second half, the result was never really in much doubt. It was a fitting end to the scorched-earth campaign undertaken by the Buckeyes and head coach Ryan Day who, following an embarrassing 13-10 loss to rival Michigan, went on to blow out Tennessee, then No. 1 seed Oregon, then Texas, and finally Notre Dame. After all that, Ryan Day has finally proven he can win the big one, and the projected $20 million that was spent in NIL money to put together this championship roster ended up being a worthwhile investment.
Ohio State quarterback Will Howard threw for 231 yards on 17-of-21 passing, ran for another 57 yards, and finished with two touchdowns and no interceptions. After executing an 18-play drive to score first, which included nine QB runs by Riley Leonard, the Irish spent the rest of the first half completely shut out. Leonard threw for 255 yards overall and ran for 40. Although Leonard led a decent comeback to get back within eight points in the second half, Ohio State had too much firepower to feel truly threatened.</span>

                              <span>Today’s mix opens with a KMRU track and then a couple of scores: Theodore Shapiro’s Severance and Angelo Badalamenti’s Twin Peaks. There are piano-led instrumentals by Greta Morgan (more on her tomorrow) and molly leach. We play two new guitar instrumentals from Blue Lake and SUSS – the latter is an ambient country cover of “This Land Is Your Land.” We get into deeper guitar cuts by Durutti Column, Barry Archive Johnson, and The Deku Trio. We selected three beats from Madlib’s Yesterday’s New Quintet project, and then the mix winds down with dub techno from Porter Ricks and Museum. We hope you enjoy.</span>

                              <span>Nothing lingers in the aftermath of failure quite like the decision not taken that could have become success. Thus, the Baltimore Ravens will spend the next eight months asking why, with their last chance to advance to the AFC championship game against Kansas City, they chose not to make the safe and logically defensible play to save themselves with their most reliable weapon. With two yards and two points to gain that would have put the Ravens in a 27-27 tie with the Buffalo Bills, they decided not to use running back Derrick Henry to get them, and the result will operate as a trigger for years of recriminations, because that&#x27;s how sports works—the losses always linger longer.
And the most maddening thing for the Ravens and their fans is that the play they called that would have tied the game worked brilliantly, all the way until the moment that ultra-reliable tight end Mark Andrews dropped the sure-thing conversion pass from Lamar Jackson that brought the Ravens down. It was a simple physical mistake, not a miscalculation or a mental blunder, that sent the Bills to their annual date with Kansas City this coming Sunday, and for Andrews, who had also fumbled earlier in the fourth quarter to help the Bills take an eight-point lead, the agony will be a tattoo on his chest that can be summoned on demand by NFL Films.</span>

                              <span>Deniz Selman’s family moved to Philadelphia from Turkey when he was four. His parents were basketball fans and quickly became attached to the Sixers, who won the NBA title that season, but the Eagles were an afterthought. The sport was unfamiliar.
Selman first attended an Eagles game when they hosted the Miami Dolphins in December 1987. His family had seats in the first row of Veterans Stadium from which it was basically impossible to see the game, so they ended up getting glimpses of the game while wandering the stadium. The Eagles lost, 28-10, as Dan Marino threw for 376 yards and three touchdowns. Despite that, Selman quickly got hooked on the Birds.</span>

                              <span>On paper, the Houston Texans outperformed expectations. They ran more plays  than the Kansas City Chiefs, possessed the ball for longer, were better on third down, and had more total yards. The defense harried quarterback Patrick Mahomes, and after halftime the offense put together a 10-minute drive to score a touchdown to put the score within one. Ultimately, none of this mattered. Houston would have lost by double digits on Saturday if not for an intentional safety by the Chiefs at the end of their 23-14 divisional-round victory, sending them to a seventh straight AFC title game.
Neither team lost a fumble or threw an interception, but the Texans still made a few costly mistakes. Kansas City&#x27;s Nikko Remigio returned the opening kick 63 yards, and afterward Houston&#x27;s Kris Boyd was flagged for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, giving the Chiefs a red-zone appearance within 13 seconds of the game. The normally reliable Texans kicker Ka&#x27;imi Fairbairn missed an extra point and a 55-yard field goal try, and had another FG attempt blocked. Houston seemed to be facing a second opponent in the play clock, and on one occasion, a rushed fourth-and-10 call was doomed before it could really develop, resulting in a 16-yard sack of Texans QB C.J. Stroud. Early in the first quarter, he came up limping after a run, and he became easier to hit. Stroud threw for 245 yards as he absorbed eight total sacks.</span>
