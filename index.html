                              <span>LAS VEGAS — For as long as I can remember, I have felt drawn to creatures often described as uncharismatic: deep-sea fish; an ugly bunch of bugs; maggots with faces on their butts; any creature with &quot;blob&quot; in its name. As I&#x27;ve grown older, this interest has felt increasingly moral, as these creatures are less likely to bask in the glow of a spotlight in conservation with the power to lift a species out of the trenches of endangerment, or even extinction. But sometimes I&#x27;ll see a, let&#x27;s say, conventionally adorable animal that makes me forget all these weirdos, at least for a moment, and think: Whoa. Now there&#x27;s a cutie patootie. 
Last week, I experienced one of these rare moments of awe while appreciating in the biodiversity of Las Vegas, a city that, for all its illuminated turrets and spheres, borders some of the most beautiful nature I&#x27;ve seen. I was walking with a few friends in their neighborhood park, which snaked through a miniature valley of desert scrub. At first, it seemed like we were the only ones here. But the longer we walked, the more creatures emerged. We were mooned by sandy-colored desert cottontails foraging right before dusk. We were menaced by a small, striped rodent I would later identify as a male white-tailed antelope squirrel who sported two impressively pendulous balls below his wee little tail. We watched Gambel&#x27;s quails scuttling from the shadows of one bush to another, their black plumes bobbing with every step. I recently got a pair of binoculars, and I watched each of these creatures go about their afternoon with much delight.</span>

                              <span>We talk about a wide range of topics on The Distraction, and one of our goals is to eventually broaden it to include areas of interest beyond sports, aging, and lunch sometime in the next few years. Of the many possible options that we&#x27;ve discussed, a pivot to &quot;true crime&quot; had ranked pretty low. It&#x27;s not the energy we seek to cultivate, and hearing Drew honking through the details of a high-profile unsolved kidnapping would be pretty upsetting regardless of what those details were. So it&#x27;s likely that this week&#x27;s episode, which begins with Jasper Wang&#x27;s perplexing Montana real estate mystery, is as close to true crime as we&#x27;re likely to get.</span>

                              <span>Bill Belichick has a lot of work to do to turn the University of North Carolina football program into a perennial success. That&#x27;s why the 72-year-old has assembled a team of top football minds around him. All the heavy hitters are here: Michael Lombardi, Freddie Kitchens, Steve Belichick, Matt Lombardi, Mike Priefer, and Jordon Hudson. 
Hudson is Belichick&#x27;s 24-year-old girlfriend. Their relationship was a queasy one from the moment it launched, and it has become only more grimace-inducing as time goes on. Last month, for example, Pablo Torre reported that Hudson has essentially been acting as Belichick&#x27;s agent. That reporting is now seemingly backed up by an email uncovered by The Assembly reporter Matt Hartman while he was reporting on UNC&#x27;s rapidly increasing athletics budget.</span>

1. $2. So rare! So delightfully wrong; receiving one feels like briefly being transported to a parallel dimension where everything is just slightly off, like you&#x27;d break your $2 to purchase a Poca-Cola. Did you know, the front (&quot;obverse&quot;) of the two-dollar bill is the oldest of any current U.S. banknote, going unchanged since 1929?

Don’t believe me? Dianna Russini of The Athletic is saying that Rodgers is “intrigued” by the idea of playing in Minnesota. And Peter Schrager of NFL Network told his audience that Rodgers might sign with the Steelers, but needs “up to four weeks” to make his decision, and that the Steelers are “giving him some space” to think it through. An uncharacteristically terse Adam Schefter says that the Giants “want” him. That’s a lot of suitors! But which of them will go all in to secure the services of this four-time MVP? Or will a surprise contender—Kansas City?—emerge from out of nowhere? WE NEED AN ANSWER, DAMMIT!</span>

                              <span>Lamine Yamal&#x27;s first stardust play of the game began with an apology. Carrying the ball up the field 10 minutes into Tuesday&#x27;s deciding leg of the Barcelona-Benfica Champions League tie, Lamine picked up his head, saw Raphinha opening up his stride, and lifted his hand in contrition.
The gesture communicated that he appreciated the Brazilian forward&#x27;s run, which presented the duo a great chance for another one of the thunderbolts they&#x27;ve spent all season tossing back and forth to each other, but as he hadn&#x27;t read the play quickly enough and wasn&#x27;t prepared to hit the pass before its window of opportunity closed, the Spaniard couldn&#x27;t reward his teammate&#x27;s effort with the pass the moment called for. Coming from the talent it came from, implicit in this apology was another sentiment: &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ll make up for it.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Cooper Flagg has been conceived of as the surefire top overall pick in this June&#x27;s NBA Draft since he reclassified two years ago, and despite taking on the enormous pressure of getting into the draft sooner, Flagg has only strengthened his case this year. Around him in the lottery, Rutgers&#x27; Dylan Harper has been doing a convincing Ethical James Harden bit; Baylor&#x27;s VJ Edgecombe has been making all the Draft hardcores I read flush in awe; and Harper&#x27;s teammate Ace Bailey has finally learned to pass the basketball, showing both an awareness of other people lacking through the first three months of the season and the capacity to grow and change. Nothing that cohort, nor anyone else in college or international basketball, has done has been as impressive as what Flagg&#x27;s been doing at Duke. Not only has he produced at a staggering level, he&#x27;s playing tomorrow&#x27;s basketball, today.
With hopefully just a few more games left in his college career, and with the stinky end of the NBA content to befoul the court now that the trade deadline has passed and its members can lose in peace, it is time to consider where Flagg could end up. Also, more to the point, where he should end up. Not every team in the lottery is as worthy, by my arbitrary standards, of capturing the Flagg. The NBA Draft&#x27;s structure not only limits how much money Flagg can make for many years, the draft lottery means he has zero control over where he will work for the majority of the next decade. Such is life in the NBA, under the current Collective Bargaining Agreement. Some players walk the blessed path and end up in a great city and on a great roster, and others are drafted by the Sacramento Kings.</span>

                              <span>The last time the San Francisco 49ers had the kind of crisis of faith they’re currently enduring, they wrote it off as a weird emanation from COVID. Back then, they went from ending a season with a Super Bowl loss to Patrick Mahomes to enduring one of double-digit losses, mostly because the bulk of their offensive playmakers were gone for some portion of the season and  their defense slipped from elite to meh, bordering on feh. That relative patience was rewarded with a bounce-back season in 2021 and a trip to the conference final, a double-down season in 2022 and another trip to the conference final, and finally another run of excellence in 2023 that ended with...losing another Super Bowl to Patrick Mahomes.
History has a way of repeating itself, especially where losing to Patrick Mahomes is concerned, but the 49ers do not seem to believe that this cycle is going to make another revolution. Last year was another injury-plagued season that saw the Niners go from double-digit wins to double-digit losses. This time, Kyle Shanahan, who runs the building with full acquiescence from the fully satisfied York family, has seemingly decided that the windows are not only closed but need full replacement and double-paning. At least we think that&#x27;s what he decided. For the first time in his eight-plus years in charge, he might not actually be in charge.</span>

                              <span>Yesterday, the President of the United States filmed an advertisement for Tesla on the driveway of the White House. They might as well have erected a ginormous flag and one of those balloon men that flop around, because the South Lawn is a car dealership now. Maybe they could have unfurled a sign that read &quot;Deals Deals Deals!&quot;
Except there were no deals. Instead, there was a line of five Teslas looking like shiny garbage. The reason behind this is simple: Elon Musk is now the president&#x27;s big boy best friend, and Elon Musk has four jobs (Twitter, SpaceX, destroying the government illegally, and Tesla). His fourth job, Tesla, is the one he seems the most sensitive about, probably because it&#x27;s the only one that had even a slight chance of success. Instead, Tesla stock has been dropping since mid-December, because many Americans have realized that Elon Musk is a goon.</span>

                              <span>Who likes The Free Press? This is a question I have found myself asking, more often than is good for me, about Bari Weiss&#x27;s suddenly large and well-monied media company, which according to the New York Times Magazine has more than three dozen full-time employees and at least 100,000 paying subscribers. I recently went to the homepage, scanned the day&#x27;s meager offering of bone-dry headlines—highlights: &quot;How I Became A Wife&quot; and &quot;Things Worth Remembering: Money Can Ruin Your Life&quot;—and there was the question again: Who is getting fired up to read this crap?
It&#x27;s a question that has become easier to answer in recent days and weeks. Over the weekend, pro-Palestine activist and Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil was detained by the Department of Homeland Security and disappeared to a detention facility in Louisiana without being charged with a crime. As a set of facts—a campus activist was arrested by the federal government over speech acts—this is a story that should have been red meat for Weiss and The Free Press. Weiss essentially built her career by positioning herself as one of the few people brave enough to ring the alarm bell about the rise of anti-speech illiberalism on college campuses and in broader society. It&#x27;s something she and her cohort never really shut up about, in fact. And yet, so far, The Free Press has published one article about Khalil&#x27;s arrest, which reads as a wholly dispassionate rundown of the facts of the case and cedes its point of view to the Some people say this is good, while others say it is bad framing that was long ago perfected by The New York Times:</span>

                              <span>The play that won the game for the Indiana Pacers Tuesday night deserved a bucket. The ethical fan of the Milwaukee Bucks, otherwise mired in frustration and disillusionment this fine spring morning, cannot deny this much: Rick Carlisle sketched up a beaut. 
Down three points with just under four seconds to play, the Pacers used a timeout to move the ball into the front court, but then positioned the inbounder&#x27;s four teammates in the backcourt, in a spread formation not unlike what you&#x27;d see before a Hail Mary pass in football. The possibility flashed through my mind; it must&#x27;ve occurred to the Bucks, who were gesturing and repositioning and glancing around in uncertainty until the moment the play was triggered.</span>

                              <span>For centuries, Jupiter reigned as king of the moons. Initially, the Big Four, discovered by Galileo, and then as optics and astronomy advanced, more and more, smaller and smaller bodies, until Big J could proudly boast of 95 moons in its orbital thrall. But Jupiter got cocky. Jupiter rested on its laurels. Jupiter, it turns out, was playing against plumbers and mailmen when it put up its record numbers. 
Saturn, meanwhile, was hungry. Saturn ate the tape and put in the hours in the gym. In 2020, astronomers discovered 20 new Saturnian moons. In 2023, they racked up 62 more. This week, the International Astronomical Union formally recognized a whopping 128 further new satellites, giving Saturn a total of 274 moons, a record that will surely never be broken (in this solar system, which as we all know is the galaxy&#x27;s top-tier league). Saturn has more moons than it knows what to do with! It has more moons than the rest of the planets combined! Jupiter can attempt to dry its tears with its pathetic 95 Jovian moons, which compared to mighty Saturn might as well be no moons at all. Jupiter? More like Venus!!

                              <span>On April 29, 1970, Dave DeBusschere of the New York Knicks hit a jump shot from the circle with three seconds left to give his team a 102-100 lead over the Los Angeles Lakers in the third game of the NBA Finals. LA’s Wilt Chamberlain inbounded the ball immediately to guard Jerry West. His first dribble was a feint to the left. West then cut back toward the middle of the court and let fly from 60 feet, over, I think, Dick Barnett . (The video looks like it was shot underwater on Mars.) On the video of the shot, the sound in the arena almost cuts out entirely until the ball goes through the net to force overtime—at the end of which, I would point out, the Lakers lost anyway.
It is probably as iconic a basket as was ever scored in the NBA, not only because it was scored by a certifiable NBA legend, but also because the shot was … a shot. It was not a heave. It was not a “desperation toss,” as Gene Hackman warned his Hickory Huskers against in the Sectional Finals against Linton. It was not some kind of baseball pass aimed roughly at the area code in which the basket is located. There was nothing freaky about it.</span>

                              <span>You can, of course, be an artist in total solitude. But it&#x27;s more realistic, practical, and, some would argue, fulfilling to practice creativity in community. Human beings bring with them their own backstories and neuroses, sensitivities and idiosyncrasies, which are what make them special, and also what often make them annoying. This week, we reflected on the price we pay for community, which is having to tolerate people you may not entirely know, or like, but feel free to judge all the same.
This week we officially enter week 10, which begins the fourth quarter of The Artist&#x27;s Way. Shout out to those of you who have endured so far. We&#x27;re almost finished!</span>

Is a campus actually safer after police are permitted to toss around protestors and arrest students? Of course not. But by finding the right face and name to agitate enough racists, it can be presented as a severe issue. Any breach of rights can be justified in service of that goal.

The Leafs blueliner took five or six consecutive unblocked shots to the dome, and was pulled down to the ice, and dislocated his thumb and had to pop it back in while sitting in the penalty box. On the other hand, Benoit was captured in some impossibly cool photos going airborne with an attempted Superman punch. Some might argue that looking cool is the most important part of hockey, and life. Not me, though.

                              <span>With just about three-quarters of the Premier League season done and dusted, there&#x27;s little drama on either extreme of the table. At the bottom, barring a collapse from one of the not-quite-relegation-fodder teams, the recently promoted trio of Ipswich Town, Leicester City, and Southampton will be yo-yoing back down to the Championship. Meanwhile, at the top, Arsenal&#x27;s 1-1 draw against Manchester United on Sunday means Liverpool now sits on a surely insurmountable 15-point lead in what can&#x27;t even really be called a title &quot;race&quot; anymore.
This doesn&#x27;t mean the Premier League is devoid of drama, though, and in fact there is one fight in the standings that looks certain to go to the very last round. I&#x27;m referring here to the race for the third, fourth, and fifth spots on the table, all of which should give Champions League qualification for next season. A quick explanation for why there will likely be five rather than the usual four continental places for the Prem: the Champions League&#x27;s new format grants an additional entry spot to the league with the highest coefficient on an annual basis, and this year the top dogs are practically a lock to be the English.</span>

                              <span>Ottawa fans have had it rough, but if they&#x27;ve been waiting for the Senators to really make them feel something, Monday&#x27;s win over the Detroit Red Wings was a night to savor. Just check out these clips from midway through the game, right after the Sens broke the 0-0 tie. Linus Ullmark, a goalie who&#x27;s been shaky but ultimately an asset in his first year with the club, whipped the house into a frenzy with a showcase of quick reflexes and lucky breaks. I especially love the flying fist in the crowd that breaks the camera&#x27;s sight line after the second clearance. You can imagine the person it&#x27;s attached to shouting &quot;Yes! Hahaha! Yes!&quot;</span>

                              <span>There are the obvious reasons to cheer against a Duke basketball team, but for a long time, I’ve had my own special justification: Before she took a job as head coach of a program at the bottom of the ACC, Kara Lawson was a first-rate color commentator, and I selfishly wanted her back on my TV talking hoops. A mutual parting of ways, a sudden change of heart—anything would do! The private-school elites couldn’t get away with blocking access to a public resource for their own gain. 
It turns out private-school elites can and do get away with that, a lot. The Kara Lawson For All movement suffered a blow at this past weekend’s ACC Tournament. On Sunday, as she celebrated the Duke women’s first conference championship since 2013, Lawson reflected on a long journey. The pandemic cut short her first year at Duke—the team decided to suspend the 2020-21 season after four games—and in subsequent seasons, the Blue Devils struggled in a tough conference. “Five years later,” Lawson said in her postgame interview. “We’re at the top.”</span>

                              <span>Sam Darnold has a reassuring habit of overperforming when expectations are nonexistent. That was a trait that came in handy for him in the role of bridge quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings in 2024, and he’ll have to bank on it again now that the Seattle Seahawks have inked him to a three-year deal in the Baker Mayfield range of pay. If you’re a fan of the Seahawks, you’re probably not all that excited by this move. In fact, you might very well be stumped, if not apoplectic. You might be like WELL FUCK A DUCK WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT?
This is somewhat understandable. Darnold crapped out as a No. 3 overall pick by the Jets before heading to Minnesota last season and waging one of the more unlikely Pro Bowl campaigns in league history, throwing for 35 TDs and more than 4,000 yards as the Vikings went a gaudy 14-3. Darnold even beat these same Seahawks, in Seattle, with a big-boy TD pass to Justin Jefferson in the waning minutes. In the rain. On a busted leg. It was enough to make you wonder if Darnold, and not rookie J.J. McCarthy, was the answer at QB that Minnesota fans had been waiting for. And if you weren’t a Vikings fan, you could at least drool over the prospect of your team landing this man in free agency. If you told a Seahawks fan after that Minnesota loss that they were getting THAT Darnold, they’d be psyched.</span>

                              <span>The Yosuke Watanuki tennis experience is a heady mix: non-stop smiles, mid-match soda, dizzyingly good winners. There won&#x27;t be a better storyline out of the men&#x27;s draw at Indian Wells. He&#x27;s the lowest-ranked man to reach the tournament&#x27;s round of 16 since 2004.
Ahead of Sunday night&#x27;s third-round match, I thought that the world No. 379 Watanuki, a qualifier, would beat No. 17 Frances Tiafoe. It wasn&#x27;t quite as spicy a prediction as it might appear. Watanuki had been playing well since he qualified for the tournament, and I was unconvinced by Tiafoe&#x27;s shaky round-of-64 win over qualifier Damir Dzumhur. There was also one small but relevant fact: Watanuki was currently working on a trial basis with Tiafoe&#x27;s former coach, Wayne Ferreira, who must have alerted his new player to his old player&#x27;s soft spots. Watanuki had played mind-melting tennis in the only prior meeting between these two, at the 2023 Miami Open, which Tiafoe narrowly won. History said it was a pretty good matchup for the underdog.</span>

                              <span>One month ago, Demi Vollering held her first press conference as a rider for FDJ-Suez and insisted that her season was not about revenge. Vollering, arguably the peloton&#x27;s best rider, had spent four increasingly antagonistic seasons with SD Worx, inarguably the peloton&#x27;s best team, so no matter what she says, everyone involved in last year&#x27;s Tour de France Femmes debacle is necessarily going to be in conflict with each other. This presents a fascinating dynamic; this past weekend, it made for some fantastic racing.
Vollering claimed her second Strade Bianche on Saturday, destroying Anna van der Breggen on the run into Siena&#x27;s Piazza del Campo and winning by 18 seconds. The men&#x27;s race was fun, though all it taught us is that Tadej Pogacar is truly blessed by God; the women&#x27;s race showed that Vollering versus her old team is going to be fun as hell to watch all year, and that Vollering might have the upper hand. FDJ was incredible, setting the pace alongside Jumbo with such authority that not even an obviously doomed breakaway was allowed to form (maybe they learned their lesson after the disaster at Omloop). Vollering&#x27;s fellow FDJ newcomer Juliette Labous was tremendous in keeping her team leader at the front of the race and eventually helping her take part in what would turn out to be the winning move. When van der Breggen attacked just ahead of a foreboding 18-percent gradient, Vollering was fresh enough to follow her countrywoman, then destroy her on the famed run-up into town.</span>

                              <span>On Saturday, Mikko Rantanen scored his first goal in his first game for his third team of the season. At the start of a final period that saw Dallas nab a trio of goals to force Edmonton to white-knuckle a 5-4 win, the Stars&#x27; latest pickup comfortably one-timed a cross-ice feed from Matt Duchene. That play showed the kind of offensive skill that any Cup hopeful would love to add, even for a hefty bundle of picks.

                              <span>It is not easy to wade through this sentence without whiplash: &quot;As he considers walking away from a stadium deal in St. Petersburg, Fla., Tampa Bay Rays owner Stu Sternberg is being pressured to sell his team by MLB commissioner Rob Manfred and some other owners.&quot;
Not that it&#x27;s badly written—as constructed by Evan Drellich of The Athletic, it&#x27;s perfectly understandable. What gives it that special feeling of traumatic brain injury is the idea that Rob Manfred, or any commissioner, would pressure any owner to do anything, ever. That&#x27;s just not what commissioners do, because the first law of capitalist relationships is in force here: &quot;Those who pay the salary give orders to those who receive it.&quot; And since the argument into which Manfred has allegedly insinuated himself involves hundreds of millions of dollars, the idea of &quot;pressure&quot; is essentially unfathomable. In other words, &quot;What?&quot;</span>

                              <span>Europe really is in a shambolic state! As if being abandoned by the U.S. in favor of an Eastern bloc bully wasn’t enough, now comes word that Ireland likely won’t threepeat as Six Nations champions after all! 
Ireland took it on the chin and every other body part from France in a 42-27 loss on Saturday in Dublin. The final score doesn’t really reflect just how brutally the Irish were pounded in the second half of the match. The French players appeared to get bigger, stronger, and faster during a stretch in which they scored 34 unanswered points, crushing the hopes and dreams of the Aviva Stadium crowd and all fans of the tournament’s two-time defending champs. Ireland had a slight lead in the table heading into this much anticipated match, and was the betting favorite to beat France, which would have all but cemented another title in the world’s greatest annual international rugby competition. And what a big title that would be: The Six Nations tournament has been held among Europe’s finest squads since 1883, yet no country has ever won three consecutive outright championships in the event.</span>

The Floridian and Arizonan existence of warmth and sunshine augurs their return to my own northern clime, and the ambient noises of baseball are comfort sounds in their own right. But I have gradually realized that spring training is not actually a time of hope, as I have long believed, but rather a time of despair. A time of pain.
A time to learn that your team&#x27;s hotshot young starting pitcher, looking to follow up a star-making rookie season, couldn&#x27;t complete a throwing session because of some back tightness. All subsequent updates—PRP injections! Shut down from throwing for a couple months!—are only ever more ominous.*</span>

                              <span>Tom Brady isn’t officially the general manager of the Las Vegas Raiders, but let’s pretend that he is so that we can make fun of him. Ever since buying a minority stake in the team last year, Brady was reportedly going to be very hands-on with the team’s affairs. Hiring former Bucs executive John Spytek as official GM was an obvious indicator of that, as was Brady’s meet-cute with Matthew Stafford up at a Montana ski resort before Stafford re-upped with the Rams. Shit, Brady even convinced new head coach Pete Carroll that working for this clownshow would be more fulfilling than doing nothing at all!
But now that we’re about to enter the legal tampering period of free agency, also known as “the start of free agency,” Fancy Tom is gonna have to put together an actual roster. He got a head start on that process Friday night by acquiring Geno Smith for a third-round pick.</span>

                              <span>Kyle Kuzma knocked down a three-pointer from the wing in the fourth quarter Sunday night, to pull the Milwaukee Bucks to within five points of the East-leading Cleveland Cavaliers. The score at that moment was 89-84. The Bucks had done this a few times already, scrambled and shoved and shoulder-charged their way to within a couple buckets of the visitors, who despite their all-timer of a win percentage are just a game up on the Oklahoma City Thunder for the NBA&#x27;s top overall record. Kuzma&#x27;s three, nailed with 8:55 left in regulation, seemed to keep momentum on Milwaukee&#x27;s side, after they&#x27;d closed a 15-point first-half deficit to four points late in the third quarter.
The sequence to follow, ah, went poorly for the home side. A little over four minutes later, Darius Garland slipped a pass in traffic to a rolling Jarrett Allen, Allen thundered home a right-handed dunk over Brook Lopez, the crowd went absolutely silent, and the scoreboard showed the Bucks still standing flat-footed on 84 points but somehow now 18 points behind the visitors. Doc Rivers called a timeout. The game was over, but Rivers—always a few beats slower about this kind of thing—needed another 92 seconds to fully internalize it, whereupon he emptied his bench for the game&#x27;s final three minutes.</span>

                              <span>Because of Cooper Flagg, the Duke Blue Devils faced their first tough test in a while against UNC on Saturday. Thanks to Flagg, they wound up with a 13-point win anyway.
Flagg committed an obvious offensive foul with 3:18 left in the first half of last night&#x27;s game, sending him to the bench with three fouls and as many points. The Tar Heels instantly ripped off a 10-2 run, then hit a bunch of difficult shots to give themselves a quick seven-point lead early in the second half. Rather than wilt, Flagg spent the game&#x27;s final 15 minutes showing why NBA GMs are so high on him. Duke started to run everything through Flagg, and he notched five assists, four blocks, and zero fouls through the rest of the game as the Blue Devils won, 82-69. With little margin for error, Flagg made the right play every time, on both ends of the court. The 18-year-old is so huge and skilled that &quot;the right play&quot; was often something bombastic, like rotating over and erasing a layup despite his own teammate crashing into him, or driving left around intense ball pressure and dunking it, per Flagg&#x27;s mother, on everyone&#x27;s &quot;fucking head.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Expectations this season for the Los Angeles Lakers have skyrocketed, which tends to happen after acquiring a franchise player from a team that appears to be practicing self-sabotage. Since the trade for Luka Doncic, the Lakers have looked more formidable than they have since their conference finals run in 2023, compiling an eight-game win streak that included a convincing 23-point victory over the Denver Nuggets, who swept them out of those conference finals. But Saturday night in Boston delivered a bit of a heat check.
It&#x27;d be excessive to say that the Celtics embarrassed the Lakers. Boston only led by four at halftime. The third quarter was where it all turned: The visiting team got cold, and the C&#x27;s built a 22-point lead during that frame by outshooting their opponents 29-13. The Celtics didn&#x27;t trail at any point in the second half as they won, 111-101.</span>

                              <span>Eephus, which opens theatrically in limited release beginning March 7, is “designed to break your heart.” Directed and co-written by Carson Lund in his feature debut, the film unfolds across the length of a single Sunday afternoon adult recreational baseball league between Adler’s Paint and the Riverdogs, beginning as the players get dressed in the parking lot and warm up with soft toss, continuing through nine innings of hamstring-testing hustle doubles and crushed cans of Narragansett, and ending as the October dusk fades to night. It’s the last game, and not just of the season: The field will soon be bulldozed to make way for a new elementary school.
Shot over the course of a month on a local field in Douglas, Mass., Eephus is something like the concentrated essence of baseball, packing in a season’s worth of sense memory—the saltiness of a sunflower seed shell, the weight of a batting donut, the greasiness of a streak of eye black—at the languid tempo of a second baseman holding up his index and pinkie finger for the right fielder after the second out of an inning. The banter ebbs and flows between baserunners and fielders, between teammates on either side of the dugout, alternately hotheaded and banal.</span>

                              <span>Growing up, Sabrina Valenti felt like she was genetically predetermined to work for the government. Her dad&#x27;s father was in the Navy. Her dad was in the Air Force. Two of her uncles served in the armed forces, one eventually moving to a job at NASA and the other leaving for the postal service. Her mom&#x27;s father was a state senator in Maine. One of Valenti&#x27;s sisters is a teacher, and the other works for a transit agency in a major American city. &quot;I was going to work in the public sector, one way or another,&quot; Valenti said.
Valenti grew up in the Florida panhandle, where she witnessed Hurricane Katrina whip through the gulf. And she was in high school when the oil drilling rig Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico, killing 11 workers and causing the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history. During the spill, Valenti recalls seeing &quot;no wake zone&quot; signs everywhere to prevent boats&#x27; waves knocking tar balls ashore. Every day before school, Valenti would grab the newspaper from the front porch and see a photo of oil billowing out of a wellhead. For months, Valenti wondered if the paper would say that the well was finally capped. The spill was eventually contained after 87 days. &quot;You&#x27;re sitting there powerless, knowing that this oil is going to kill shorebirds and seabirds, that it&#x27;s going to kill fish, that it&#x27;s going to cause birth defects in dolphins,&quot; Valenti said.</span>

                              <span>Welcome to Listening Habits, a new column where I share the music I’ve been fixated on recently.
In the first quarter of the year, a number of the notable new rap albums have come from older rappers, many of whom were most relevant to me when I was a teenager in the 2000s. Some of these albums are more successful than others. One of the stronger efforts comes from 2 Chainz, the Alchemist, and (the much younger) Larry June, who released the collaborative album Life Is Beautiful last month. Here, Chainz and Larry make what could be called Yacht Rap over luxurious, though a little monotonous, Alchemist beats. In this same vein, we&#x27;ve gotten a new Busta Rhymes album, an album from Webbie and his son Tre Savage, and a new album from Jim Jones, fresh off beefing with Cam&#x27;ron online over old Dipset drama (again).</span>

                              <span>As a general rule, I do not relisten to episodes of the podcast. I spend all day hearing my own voice, inside my head and out, and the idea of going back for more me is ... well, I was going to write horrifying, which seems harsh. I will just say it&#x27;s not what I want. I would honestly love less me, if that option were available. But of all the episodes of the podcast that I have not relistened to, the one that we put out last November, in which Drew and the excellent sports-and-politics newsletter writer Denny Carter tried to get me pumped up for the election, is the one I have not relistened to the most. Not because it wasn&#x27;t a good episode—I remember it as having a good number of laughs and an ideal 50/50 split between politics and not politics—but for reasons that are very obvious. We are, of course, wrong all the damn time on this podcast; it is something like our brand, give or take Talking About Lunch and sudden monologues about the Minnesota Vikings. But some ways of being wrong sting more than others.</span>

                              <span>Did you watch Kings–Nuggets last night? So did Nikola Jokic. The three-time MVP had one of his worst games of the season against the mediocre and shorthanded Kings, laboring to 22 points and 15 rebounds with seven turnovers and a relatively ghastly minus-seven. Jokic has been struggling a bit by his incredible standards since the all-star break, which is mostly due to opposing coaches borrowing a hilarious stratagem rolled out by Lakers coach JJ Redick in L.A.&#x27;s impressive blowout win over Denver two weeks ago. The scheme is simple: Deny Jokic the ball, at any cost, compromising every single other part of your defense if you have to. The scheme runs counter to almost every modern maxim of defense, yet it&#x27;s working.
In practice, here&#x27;s what it looked like against Sacramento. Jake LaRavia&#x27;s only job in the clip below is to essentially box Jokic out, while Markelle Fultz and DeMar DeRozan give like 10 feet of space to Peyton Watson and Russell Westbrook in order to be able to double Jokic the second he gets the ball. You hear maxims like &quot;Force the rest of the team to beat you!&quot; all the time, but rarely do you see defenses contort themselves like this. The Kings keep all five guys within a foot of the paint for the duration of the play, and Westbrook was kind enough to give them what they wanted by running into a poorly considered midrange jumper.</span>

                              <span>Gene Hackman died last week. He was one of the greatest actors America has ever produced. A performer of near infinite utility, able to carry a film single-handedly (Hoosiers) or loom over it with just a few minutes of screen time (No Way Out). Ask a dozen people what their favorite Hackman performance was, and they’ll give you a dozen different answers, none of them wrong. Mine was Crimson Tide. Let me tell you why.
It was 1995. I’d just finished a disastrous freshman year of college that saw me transfer from one school to another at the turn of second semester. I was lonely, disappointed, and deeply unsettled. More important, my spine was fucking killing me. What I thought was some sort of hip pointer—to this day, I don’t actually know what a hip pointer is—turned out to be a blown disc in my back. I needed surgery to fix it. At the end of the school year, a doctor in Manhattan cut into my back, removed the piece of disc lodged against my spinal cord, and then stitched me back up. From there, my mom drove me all the way back to my folks’ house in Connecticut, where a long, manic summer of convalescence awaited me.</span>

                              <span>Baseball is a beautiful game. Sometimes, you get to watch your team perform incredible feats of athletic prowess while wearing tight pants, and sometimes you watch them give up back-back-to-back home runs. That&#x27;s America&#x27;s pastime, baby!
This chaotic state of life extends to managers, too. They&#x27;re just like us! Take, for example, this spring training game that the Phillies played against the Tigers on Wednesday. In the bottom of the second, Phillies pitcher Jesús Luzardo loaded the bases with two outs. In the dugout, his manager Rob Thomson was on the air, wearing a pop-star microphone while a camera stared directly at him. As a result, we got to watch him watch Luzardo give up not one, not two, but three home runs on three consecutive pitches.</span>

                              <span>Twenty-seven shots to two. Ten shots on target to one. A whopping 71 to 29 possession split. Hell, even on corners it was 14 to 2. Paris Saint-Germain hosted Liverpool in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16 on Wednesday, and thoroughly demolished what has been the best team in Europe this season. The stats were solidly in PSG&#x27;s favor, as was the flow of the game, the kind that the phrase &quot;one-way traffic&quot; was invented for. In every way but one, this would indicate a dominant win for the Ligue 1 leaders. Unfortunately for the Parisiens, the one advantage they didn&#x27;t enjoy is the only one that matters.

                              <span>America got its first unofficial glimpse at Adam Silver&#x27;s definition of institutional despair on Wednesday night. Cleveland and Oklahoma City, back to back on national television—five hours of the future, including ads. We needn&#x27;t tell you that your entertainment mileage may vary. The business considerations for a league whose best teams play in those sub-optimal markets are no one’s problem but Silver&#x27;s and his network overlords, but the commissioner must be shitting a pewter tea set just thinking about it, and Disney the rest of the flatware.
In a league in which LeBron James and Stephen Curry and the Boston Celtics and New York Knicks continue to dominate thanks to some not-very-deeply buried biases, Wednesday’s glimpse into the new reality was illuminating. Lord knows the NBA tried. Example: during a review on an out-of-bounds play, referee Pat Fraher described the ruling by referring to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the league newest badass di tutti badasses, as &quot;SGA&quot;—the hardest of sells for a new big-name player by the weirdest of salesmen.</span>

                              <span>On Feb. 17, an illegal wildcat strike was initiated by corrections officers with the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS). One of their primary demands is to repeal the Humane Alternatives to Long Term Solitary Confinement (HALT) Act. Though New York State has pursued mediation to reverse this work stoppage, including offering to temporarily suspend elements of the HALT Act, the majority of striking officers have yet to return to their posts, leaving the incarcerated population, including myself, locked down and surrounded by chaos. At least seven people have died behind bars since this began. According to eyewitness testimony, at least one of these deaths—that of 22 year old Messiah Nantwi—was caused by a brutal beating at the hands of corrections officers. Other deaths are reportedly due to medical neglect. It is also worth noting that the strike was initiated only three days before the much anticipated announcement of murder charges brought against a group of corrections officers from Marcy Correctional Facility over the death of Robert Brooks. 
As its name suggests, the HALT Act  was designed to ensure incarcerated individuals were treated in more humane ways. Choosing to focus on rehabilitating prisoners rather than continuously and excessively penalizing us, this act prioritizes both the physical and mental health of incarcerated individuals by increasing the amount of time we are permitted social interaction with each other and with our families, while also retaining access to productive programming, such as education and job training.</span>

                              <span>As I see it, there are a few unofficial laws of science journalism when it comes to covering new research. The first and most obvious is that outlets are more likely to cover a press release if it is accompanied by nice-looking, high-resolution photos, because these make readers more likely to click on the story. Outlets are even more likely to pick up the story if those photos are of a charismatic animal: a beloved pachyderm, a striking bird, a sweet little rodent. The second law is that well-funded companies can produce better press releases than most institutions, with galleries of photos, videos, and lists of experts who are just a call away, making these stories easier to write on a tight deadline. The third law is that many journalists are overworked and underpaid, sometimes racing to meet a quota. So when a lavishly produced press release about seemingly feel-good research drops into their lap, featuring an adorable critter as a cherry on top, it is easy to write a simple story, meaning an uncritical one.
All of these laws conspired this week after the biotechnology company Colossal Bioscience released their newly created &quot;woolly mice,&quot; which the company describes as a mouse that has been gene-edited to have traits similar to those of woolly mammoths. I have previously written about the many logistical, ethical, and scientific problems with de-extinction, so I will only briefly say that de-extinction is a morally questionable gambit in a time when tens of thousands of species are threatened by extinction. I am thoroughly unconvinced by Colossal&#x27;s argument that returning extinct species to modern-day habitats, which have considerably warmed since the mammoth went extinct, will make these ecosystems more resilient to climate change. Despite its colossal promises and frequent press releases announcing secondary plans to de-extinct other animals, the company appears more invested in raising capital than restoring an actual mammoth.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s Monday night, and I check my local TV listings to see what women&#x27;s college basketball games are on. I make a note to catch all the big women&#x27;s college gymnastics meets coming up on Friday. I dutifully add all the dates for my local NWSL team&#x27;s games to my calendar. It seems and at some level just is incredibly normal to be watching women&#x27;s sports at big stadiums and on TV, but I&#x27;m also old enough to know that all this progress is due not to moral clarity or some belated public awakening to how good women&#x27;s sports can be, but to a pair of classic American forces: unintended consequences and bureaucracy.
Women&#x27;s sports has always hung on by the thinnest of threads. They are not mentioned even once in the law that created them, and once the powers that be realized what that law had done, they went all the way up to the presidency to try and undo it. The NCAA objected to supporting women&#x27;s sports, and searched for years to find a way out of that obligation. Even President Gerald R. Ford&#x27;s office seemed concerned about those &quot;women&#x27;s organizations.&quot; Our country&#x27;s perch atop global women&#x27;s sports happened not because our leadership desired it, or even cared all that much about it, or held strong feelings about the place of women in society in general. It happened due to a collection of random factors all happening in a specific time and space.</span>

Weird policy initiatives were by then a fact of life for workers in the federal government, who blew a couple of weeks immediately following Donald Trump&#x27;s second inauguration frantically chasing DEI phantoms out of their agencies&#x27; contracts and charters, at the expense of operational priorities. Chaos is the new norm. &quot;You always get these statements ahead of a transition, from agency leadership, where they say, &#x27;Hey, it&#x27;s a change in governance, a change of policy, it&#x27;s going to be difficult, but we&#x27;ll all get through it together,&#x27;&quot; a veteran of the National Park Service described to Defector. &quot;But then on Day One it was executive order after…</span>

                              <span>New Jaguars general manager James Gladstone looks like every NFL owner’s great grandnephew. He looks like he just ordered employees at the NIH to email him “five things that made you hype today.” He looks like someone an NFL player would beat the shit out of after mistaking him for Ben Solak. He looks like he believes the future of global economics lies in Queefcoin. You get the idea.
But Gladstone arrives in Jacksonville with a decent pedigree, including a nine-year stint—did he start work after graduating from middle school?—in the Rams’ front office. The Rams are a good NFL organization. They have their shit together, so it would stand to reason that Gladstone, despite the remarkable amount of Charlottesville energy he gives off, would prove surprisingly eloquent up on the podium. Sean McVay is a young guy too, you know! Not every young is hopeless! Maybe this paperboy is just what the moribund Jaguars have always needed!</span>

                              <span>I first learned to appreciate warm-ups because of Michigan hoops. The football culture at that school was intense to the point where I had multiple panic attacks in that gigantic stadium, but the basketball arena felt something like home. If you got there early enough, on the one or two times a week that the men&#x27;s team would play, you could sit right behind the bench, practically on the floor. I liked it so much more than football not only because of the decreased BAC and ambient hysteria but also for the way you could see the athletes as real people—your peers, really—and not just maize and blue gladiators. With the pep band playing familiar tunes—&quot;I Want You Back&quot; and &quot;You Can Call Me Al&quot; and so on—I could get lost in their preparations: the careful stretching-out of recent injuries, the slightly forbidden thrill of attempting a showy dunk or an ultra-long-range shot, the choreography of staff members each with their own small role to play, even if it was just fetching rebounds. It was an almost meditative way to settle in before the emotional stress to come.
I still make a point of arriving early enough to catch warm-ups—especially when I&#x27;m watching hockey, where the beauty of the skate-around a half-hour before the advertised start time carries the warmth of a religious ritual. On Tuesday, as the New York Islanders hosted the Winnipeg Jets, I was one of a very few in position to enjoy this routine—the lack of fans symbolic of an uninspiring season. But the empty seats did not portend a desolate night.</span>

My man wanted more time to fish, to hang out in the Florida Keys, and to pretend he enjoys being with his wife and children. So what does a thinking Hall of Famer do when he wants to chill, but also doesn’t mind making a few million per year on the side? You guessed it: He becomes a replacement-level yapper on television, until he doesn’t feel like doing it anymore.
“I’ve been thinking about it for the last four or five years and I’ve decided to retire from Fox. I’m going to miss it. I’m going to miss all the guys,” he said, while announcing his retirement on Colin Cowherd&#x27;s show.</span>

                              <span>One of the perks of observing LeBron James&#x27;s 22 NBA seasons is constantly being presented with new, concise ways to sum up the absurdity of that career. Here&#x27;s one he gave us during last night&#x27;s 136-115 win over the Pelicans: In a game where James went for 34-8-6 and became the first player in league history to score 50,000 combined postseason and regular-season points, his son played four minutes of garbage time and scored two points.
Give a night like that to any other NBA player navigating the downslope of his career, and it might land like a party. One last game in which the old man summons what remains of his guile and athleticism to remind people that he really used to be like that. Michael Jordan spent the last years of his career sweating out turnaround jumpers in Washington for the sake of chasing nights like these. For LeBron James, who is 40 years old, Tuesday night was just another routine game in what might be the most impressive season of this guy&#x27;s career.</span>

                              <span>Steve Kerr has visibly aged in his time as an NBA coach, which makes sense given that (a) he will turn 60 during his next training camp, and (b) Thursday&#x27;s game in Brooklyn will be his 1,000th between regular and postseason, give or take the 55 games he missed but was given credit for while recovering from back surgery. He has also been a general manager for three years in Phoenix under noted loonball Bob Sarver, worked alongside Marv Albert at ESPN, which is to say listened to Marv Albert, nearly took the Knicks job when they were embarking on a seven-year stretch of .315 basketball, voiced himself on an episode of Clone High scouting for something called &quot;Tropical Hospital,&quot; and has worked alongside all the versions of Draymond Green for more than a decade. Hell, with all that he should look like Dick Van Dyke sticking his head out of a speeding car window, spaniel-style.
But Kerr has managed all this while seeming like a much younger fellow in spirit, which in the industry is almost as revivifying as casting your get-out-of-jail-free-card lot with Stephen Curry.</span>

This is a very popular album, but you may be asking yourself the same questions that we were asking ourselves a mere week ago—questions like Who is Tate McRae? and What other song does this Tate McRae song remind me of? and Why are people mad at Tate McRae? These are all good and important and valid questions to be asking. Thank you so much for asking them.
Luckily, the two of us are garbage monsters who eat garbage all day long, so we are qualified to introduce you to Tate McRae and all of her mundane scandals.</span>

                              <span>Watching Space Ghost Coast to Coast always felt like I was getting away with something. I just wasn&#x27;t sure what. Staying up past my bedtime, both my parents asleep, sitting in the dark and watching this bizarre cartoon on a cable channel ostensibly for children, not quite getting many of the jokes, or anti-jokes, but understanding on some level that it was all very funny. I assumed I wasn&#x27;t old enough to understand it, which at that age is one of the most thrilling feelings in the world.
It was a talk show, featuring actual famous guests, and if I had more laughs at the obvious humor of Zorak (evil mantis; bandleader) and Moltar (somewhat less evil lava man; director), none of it would have worked without the straight man—dimwitted host/former superhero Space Ghost—grounding everything with his signature authoritative idiocy. And Space Ghost as a character owed everything to the commanding voice of George Lowe.</span>

                              <span>Ten minutes into the first quarter of the Dallas Mavericks&#x27; Monday night blowout loss to the Sacramento Kings, Kyrie Irving maneuvered around a Kai Jones screen and into the lane, where he split two help defenders, took a bump, and landed oddly on his left foot. His knee crumpled and he immediately went to the floor, calling for the Mavs&#x27; athletic training staff. That unit is as used to this sort of thing as any in the NBA. Irving&#x27;s insistence on staying in the game to shoot his free throws (he made them both) was initial cause for optimism, but ESPN&#x27;s Shams Charania reported on Tuesday morning that Irving had torn his ACL. The Mavericks, who were already screwed, are now totally terminal.
The theory of the Luka Doncic-Anthony Davis trade, or at least the most coherent available rationalization, was that the Mavericks were trying to win a championship right now, this year. In L.A., Davis had begun agitating to play alongside a true center (touching; was the Boogie Cousins experiment really so formative?), and he&#x27;d finally get his wish in Dallas. The Mavs could play their new do-it-all big man alongside either Daniel Gafford or Dereck Lively II and reliably beat the crap out of opponents while Irving shouldered the majority of the shot-creation burden. One could look around at the rest of the Western Conference and credibly think this formula could win three playoff series, provided P.J. Washington and the newly acquired Caleb Martin could hit their threes.</span>
