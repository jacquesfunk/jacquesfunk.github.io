                              <span>This week, some of the most prominent figures in American broadcast news tried to get away with a staggering lie. The story is a particularly instructive case study on the dynamics of the American media&#x27;s failure to accurately cover the ongoing Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza.
On Sept. 12, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced that her office would pursue criminal charges against students and alumni who protested the genocide by setting up an encampment on the University of Michigan&#x27;s main quad. That protest launched on April 22, one day after Palestinian civil defense crews unearthed a mass grave containing 180 bodies at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Yunis. On May 21, university police moved against the protest in the early morning and cleared the encampment, pepper-spraying protestors in the process. Nessel&#x27;s office filed misdemeanor trespassing charges against two of the protesters; the other seven face felony charges for &quot;an additional count of Resisting or Obstructing a Police Officer,&quot; per the DA&#x27;s office, for &quot;making direct contact with the officers&#x27; bodies&quot; while they were being arrested.</span>

                              <span>With two men on and no one out in the bottom of the ninth inning, Dodgers shortstop Miguel Rojas initially put his bat down for a bunt. This was the correct decision, from his team&#x27;s perspective: Shohei Ohtani was on deck, and Rojas would make an acceptable sacrifice to enable a possible Ohtani walk-off against the Padres. But swing the bat Rojas did, and for that, there were consequences.</span>

                              <span>The Pittsburgh Pirates completed a painful bit of business Tuesday afternoon, designating journeyman first baseman and refrigerator-shaped fan favorite Rowdy Tellez for assignment, effectively ending his 2024 season. Tellez was in Pittsburgh on a one-year contract; in all probability, Tuesday&#x27;s release brings to a close his days with the Pirates. The timing of this otherwise minor transaction is pretty icky: As first noted by Pirates fans on Twitter and then confirmed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Tellez was cut loose at the threshold of a performance bonus written into his incentive-laden contract. Tellez would&#x27;ve earned a $200,000 payout for hitting 425 plate appearances on the season; instead, after this last-minute maneuver, Tellez ends his campaign stuck on 421.
Ben Cherington, Pittsburgh&#x27;s general manager, insists this is an unfortunate but otherwise pure coincidence. &quot;Zero factor in the decision,&quot; Cherington said Tuesday, ahead of a game against the Brewers. &quot;Aware of it, certainly. I’m aware of the contracts that all players have. No factor at all, zero.&quot; According to Cherington and Pirates manager Derek Shelton, the team wants to prioritize giving roster spots to the players who are most likely to factor beyond the end of this shitty, disheartening, last-place season. In related moves, the Pirates released veteran outfielder Michael A. Taylor, also wrapping up a one-year contract, and promoted a pair of minor leaguers into the big club&#x27;s two fresh vacancies. One of these call-ups, 23-year-old Liover Peguero, is a gifted infielder with a somewhat faded prospect profile, the type of youngster that non-contenders traditionally do like to promote in September. The other, 29-year-old outfielder Joshua Palacios, is just a guy. Maybe one or both of them make the Pirates next season; for what it&#x27;s worth, both of them have already seen time with the big club and played their way back to the minors.</span>

                              <span>Rumaan Alam&#x27;s new novel Entitlement begins, as so many New York stories do, on the subway. It’s summer—&quot;strange, sultry&quot;—and the city is being terrorized by a &quot;lunatic at large who was jabbing unsuspecting commuters with a hypodermic needle.&quot; Creatively dubbed the &quot;Subway Pricker,&quot; the anonymous piquerist has already claimed three victims and the imaginations of the city’s denizens. None of this concerns Brooke Orr, who considers &quot;the pricker like Santa Claus or the tooth fairy, real only if you believed him to be.&quot; In fact, other than her new job as a program coordinator at a Manhattan foundation established by a white octogenarian billionaire named Asher Jaffee, very little seems to concern Brooke.
The headlines she reads on the train to work are &quot;anodyne ... the good luck of a boring moment in the world&#x27;s long history, Obama’s placid America.&quot; Entitlement is set in 2014, a year that that might register as anodyne in the nostalgic gaze of its post-pandemic audience, but probably wouldn&#x27;t to a 33-year-old black woman like Brooke. The summer of 2014 was the summer of Ta-Nehisi Coates&#x27;s landmark essay &quot;A Case for Reparations.&quot; It was the summer of the Flint water crisis, the summer of Elliot Rodger, the summer of the Ebola outbreak, the summer of #BringBackOurGirls. It was the same summer where Michael Brown&#x27;s body was left to bake on the hot Missouri pavement for four hours.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard to pin down Lamine Yamal&#x27;s place amongst the top players in the world today. I guess it should be no surprise that a teenager resists fixity, being in that stage of life defined by constant growth and flux.
The difficulty is twofold. On the one hand, you don&#x27;t want the allure of the new to rob you of perspective. How can you call Lamine the best player in the world for what he has done over the past six months, when, for instance, Kylian Mbappé has been doing what he does for the past six years? On the other, you can&#x27;t let your attachment to the past prevent you from accurately assessing the present state of things. Yes, he&#x27;s only 17, and he&#x27;s only been playing like this for the better part of this calendar year. But in that brief time Lamine has already achieved feats within the reach only of the game&#x27;s generational talents. How could you deny that what you routinely see from him, both in Barcelona&#x27;s colors and in Spain&#x27;s, earns him a place in the highest tier of the player hierarchy?</span>

Trotter&#x27;s charmingly deranged old Gawker blog, &quot;How to Find a Beeping Smoke Detector If You Don&#x27;t Know Where It Is.&quot; His revelatory technique: Once you have not found the smoke detector where you expected to find it, continue looking in other places until you find it. I thought of this as my wife and I hunted a mysterious high-pitched ringing sound around the main floor of our house. Trotter had eventually found the smoke detector beneath the bathroom sink (!), in the back of a cabinet (!!), covered by a bag of sand (???), nowhere near the sound&#x27;s seeming point of origin, a phenomenon he discovered was due to the auditory qualities of the alarm&#x27;s sound and the acoustic properties of his bathroom. (It&#x27;s a good blog!)
It was a sustained, maddening, high-pitched ringing sound, not all that unlike that made by a smoke or carbon monoxide detector when it&#x27;s actually set off. We couldn&#x27;t figure out what was making it; though it sounded vaguely alarm-like, it also clearly was not the sound any of our various alarms make. It seemed to be originating from the bathroom, but like Trotter&#x27;s sound, not from any discernible point in the bathroom.</span>

                              <span>This is baseball&#x27;s version of Holy Week, and because it is a much less regular occurrence than the tawdry religious hoopdeblah of the same name, its emergence should be celebrated by more than just those directly involved.
It is that rarest of rare white elks, a true multiple-team playoff race, and no it does not matter that the race involved is for the much less climactic extra wild card spots, nor that there are four right answers and roughly twice as many quizzers. It is the beauteous chaos of simultaneous events all emanating import into other corners of the world. Or in English, it&#x27;s the Royals, Tigers, Twins, and Mariners all fighting for the two American League wild card spots not already claimed by the Orioles, and the Diamondbacks, Mets, and Braves for the final two National League vacancies. All those teams have their evident flaws and alluring charms and fan bases that simultaneously warm the hearts and irritate the spleens; the winners will all both be considerable underdogs against their first-round opponents and teams with not entirely specious hopes for an improbable run deeper into the fall.</span>

                              <span>Thanks to those of you who joined us for our discussion of In the Freud Archives back in August. Not long after we finished DRAB-ing, I found myself with a free afternoon in Berkeley, and took myself out to the upstairs cafe at Chez Panisse. I left the meal with a 60 percent water, 40 percent roasted fig body composition. I can see why Jeff Masson wanted to dine there. If any of my future interview subjects would like to make plans there, you have my permission. Let’s expense some figs to the company.
This fall, we&#x27;re doing something we never do at Defector Reads A Book. You know us by now: We&#x27;re the sort of book club that skews Beowulf and Moby Dick. In a twist, we&#x27;re reading a book that is not hundreds of years old—one that, in fact, just came out today. A group of Sally Rooney newbies and completists on staff is gathering to chat Intermezzo, the buzzy Irish novelist&#x27;s fourth novel. Could this be the great Marxist chess novel of our time? We&#x27;ll have to ask Patrick.</span>

Kennedy Jr., many of the most powerful people in journalism are asking, rhetorically, Why are people making such a big deal about this? That&#x27;s not a question to be dismissed out of hand simply because other people also happen to be mad at Nuzzi for stupid reasons.
Dead-eyed hacks like Caitlin Flanagan and Chris Cillizza have made their predictable cases, as has former Buzzfeed editor-in-chief and New York Times media columnist Ben Smith. Smith, of Smith &amp; Smith Media, addressed the scandal in a confused edition of his newsletter over the weekend. Against the &quot;full fury of American media prurience and self-righteousness,&quot; Smith&#x27;s defense of Nuzzi is that to draw the ethical line at engaging in a sexual relationship with a reporting subject is arbitrary, and that the work of reporting is inherently compromising:</span>

                              <span>This Formula 1 season has gotten so topsy-turvy that it fell on Max Verstappen of all drivers to make a boring Singapore Grand Prix suddenly exciting. Thanks to Red Bull&#x27;s shabby performance, mysteriously cratered over the past few months, the excitement came not from the Dutchman&#x27;s driving, but from his mouth. At a press conference on Thursday, Verstappen was asked about qualifying at the previous week&#x27;s grand prix circuit in Baku. His reply was characteristically blunt: &quot;As soon as I headed into qualifying, I knew the car was fucked.&quot;
For a racing entity that also has Yuki Tsunoda and Yuki Tsunoda&#x27;s famously inappropriate mouth on its roster, this comment should not have rated beyond mild amusement. However, the Federation Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (or FIA, the F1 governing body) issued a warning for drivers to watch their language following the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. That warning was received poorly going into the Singapore GP weekend, with Lando Norris noting that it&#x27;s hard to control the language in the heat of the moment. Norris told The Athletic, &quot;They can just not play the radios, so it’s quite simple from their side.&quot;</span>

                              <span>On June 6, a baby-faced TikTok user named Louis, who adorns his username with two Reichskreuze—the Imperial Cross that’s often used as a neo-Nazi symbol—commented “Saxony Anhalt votes blue,” followed by a blue heart emoji, under politician Alice Weidel’s video urging people to vote AfD, the far-right Alternative for Germany party, for the 2024 EU parliamentary elections. A quick scroll down Louis’s page immediately shows two racist memes, one about Muslims and another about Black people. AfD in Saxony-Anhalt has been officially classified as an extremist group. 
Weidel’s video features an anime-style cartoon of a young man excitedly voting for the AfD. A German flag flashes before the boy’s eyes, making him quiver with joy. The entire comments section is filled with blue hearts, the color of the AfD. The video ends with the hashtag “blue instead of colorful,” referring to a rejection of the “woke madness” that embraces diversity. The youthfulness and playful animation of the video may stand in stark contrast with its deeply hateful message, but its makers know exactly who they’re targeting.</span>

                              <span>The Washington Nationals made a sudden and alarming roster move on Friday, optioning 23-year-old all-star shortstop C.J. Abrams to their Triple-A team in Rochester. If the Nationals were good—if they were overstocked with primo young hitting talent, like, say, the Baltimore Orioles—it would be possible to slide this move by as an unfortunate consequence of roster crunch. And, indeed, the Orioles also optioned a talented youngster on the same day, sending hulking 22-year-old infielder and reigning organizational Minor League Player of the Year Coby Mayo back to Norfolk, effectively ending his season. Good teams can have reasons for making painful late-season roster moves that are, if not entirely wholesome, at least coherent within the context of a competitive enterprise. This is not that.
The Nationals are not good, and there&#x27;s no one anywhere in the organization to slide all that comfortably into Abrams&#x27;s spot in the field or in the lineup. Abrams&#x27;s demotion is a disciplinary measure: As first reported by Cody Delmendo of CHGO Sports and later confirmed by Jesse Rogers of ESPN, Abrams was seen living it up at a Chicago casino until 8:00 a.m. Friday morning, and then had to suit up for a 2:00 p.m. game against the Cubs that same afternoon. After the game—Abrams went 0-for-3 with a walk in the leadoff spot, in a 3–1 loss—Nationals coach Davey Martinez pulled Abrams into a long and emotional meeting and informed him that his season was over. The Nationals haven&#x27;t exactly ratted Abrams out, but everything in their tone and demeanor confirms the scoop.</span>

                              <span>To take the old saying and mangle it in the back shop a bit, you cannot hope to beat the Las Vegas Raiders because they are so easy to contain. The latest person to learn this lesson is their 12-game-old head coach.
Antonio Pierce was advertised as the franchise’s latest savior, the coach that this historically listless roster would respond to after enduring The Josh McDaniels Experience; with Pierce setting the example, the team would vibrate with joyful devotion to the greater cause. So trusting. So naive. But these are the Raiders, who have talked it while steadfastly refusing to walk it for two full decades and change now. This is an organization that goes from &quot;Hey, who&#x27;s the new guy?&quot; to &quot;Hey, when are we getting a new guy?&quot; with uncommon swiftness. It&#x27;s why, since they lost Super Bowl The 37th back in &#x27;Ought Two, Raiders coaches have averaged 26 games between hiring and firing. That&#x27;s barely a season and a half.</span>

                              <span>One of the things that has always been captivating to me about the TV show Alone is how it illustrates our endless capacity for invention in the absolute worst of times. It&#x27;s a reality show about survival, but really what that means is adaptability. When you lose a supply of arrows, can you fashion more from branches and scavenged parts? Do you know how to use sphagnum moss to treat a wound after an unfortunate ax misadventure? If a crafty vole has raided your stores of fish, will you be able to find more food or resort to gnarly bark-based teas and intermittent fasting as the frost sets in?
It&#x27;s a manufactured danger. But part of the appeal is that there&#x27;s no one coming to the rescue. Ultimately you survive and win, or wind up another sucker ferried back to civilization after an intense flirtation with giardia. Either way, these people have to figure out a new way to live every day.</span>

                              <span>In the Premier League&#x27;s marquee showdown of the weekend, last year&#x27;s number one and number two faced off in an early clash of titans that already had title implications. Arsenal retooled this summer in order to better pursue Manchester City for a third straight season, bringing in defender Riccardo Calafiori, midfielder Mikel Merino, and forward Raheem Sterling. Sunday was Arsenal&#x27;s first crack at City this season, and though the visiting side gave up a goal to—who else—Erling Haaland in the ninth minute, the Gunners took control of the match with goals from two defenders: Calafiori tied it up in the 22nd with an incredible rocket from outside the box, and then Gabriel gave Arsenal the lead in the first minute of first half stoppage time with a rising header off a corner.

                              <span>There were some recognizable elements of the Singapore Grand Prix this year: a night race with hot weather, heavy humidity, a dew point no doubt off the charts. Correspondingly, there was tired, occasionally frustrated driving on a street circuit not built for overtakes, though this year they tried to rectify this issue by increasing the total number of DRS zones to four. Four! The saving grace for Singapore has also been its most defining characteristic: its propensity for safety cars. But this year, with some luck and a lot of engine reliability, there was nothing. 
This year&#x27;s race was won or lost in discrete moments. Ferrari lost it after a horrific qualifying; you can&#x27;t recover from P9 and P10 on the grid on a track like Singapore. Lewis Hamilton lost it after a call to put him on old soft tires to start the race; he failed to grab the all-important track position on the opening lap, and didn&#x27;t have the tires to last him to the end. And Lando Norris won it by finally converting pole position to a lap-one lead for the first time so far this season, putting to bed—or, at least, a nap—one of the most persistent criticisms levied at his driving this year.</span>

Nearly as prevalent in my feeds are the de-influencing videos. While influencers work to persuade their audience to buy products they may or may not need in the hopes of getting a few cents of commission, de-influencers remind people why they don’t need to spend their money. De-influencing material ranges from explaining why individual viral products aren&#x27;t worth buying to entire accounts built to remind audiences that hauls aren&#x27;t normal and call out undisclosed ads or partnerships with brands. De-influencing is part of a larger populist turn I&#x27;ve noticed in response to the omnipresent commercialization of the social internet, but it also exemplifies one of the internet&#x27;s signal conundrums: Is it possible to create anticapitalist work on social media?</span>

                              <span>&quot;No loss is good,&quot; said Chicago White Sox interim manager Grady Sizemore, a statement which, rather than defusing the potency of Sunday&#x27;s milestone loss, merely diffuses it across a season: If no loss is good, then each loss is bad, which means 120 losses are a death march unseen in the days of widespread color TV. That&#x27;s 120 days of feeling bad at the ballpark; 120 unsatisfied nights, wishing for a better tomorrow that rarely comes. Thirty-six chances for the South Side to stand up, weighed against 120 blunt remonstrances to remain seated.
The 43-119 Detroit Tigers of 2003 are now in the rearview mirror, still notable for possessing the last 20-game loser in Mike Maroth but no longer for owning the AL&#x27;s worst record of the modern era. The 40-120-1 New York Mets of 1962 are next up. One of the first expansion teams, before MLB had balanced its expansion rules to avoid putting out true stinkers, those Mets were wretched but charmingly pitiable, like an Instagram chihuahua. They made their own manager ask, &quot;Can&#x27;t anybody here play this game?&quot; They were and are baseball&#x27;s touchstone for terrible.

                              <span>At the end of the first quarter of their opening playoff game against the Las Vegas Aces, the Seattle Storm couldn&#x27;t have found themselves in a much better position. They were leading 18-9, having held the Aces to just 11 percent shooting from the field. Unanimous MVP A&#x27;ja Wilson, who had just received her trophy in a pregame ceremony, was 1-of-8. The Storm were cooking.
If a blueprint exists for Seattle getting past Vegas in this best-of-three first-round matchup, it looks a lot like what happened in that first quarter. The Storm, always a defense-first unit, were playing with an intensity and speed that totally discombobulated the Aces&#x27; offense. Even without defensive anchor Ezi Magbegor, Seattle&#x27;s collection of defensive hawks were switching and sliding and blitzing fast enough to make Wilson and the Aces look slow and ponderous. Every shot at the rim was contested, and Seattle&#x27;s traps and rotations fired so quickly that they looked less like a basketball team scrambling to cover the court than a well-drilled soccer team executing a perfect counter-press.</span>

                              <span>Through the better part of three quarters of football on Sunday afternoon, the Philadelphia Eagles and New Orleans Saints were locked in a world&#x27;s ugliest dog contest. Just one week earlier the Saints were rolling over the haunted remains of the Cowboys and everyone got a piece of the action; Alvin Kamara got four touchdowns, quarterback Derek Carr threw for 243 yards and two touchdowns and even got in on a QB sneak on the way to a 44-19 win. 
On Sunday they led 3-0 thanks to an early field goal and Eagles coach Nick Sirianni&#x27;s commitment to salvaging genius from ineptitude. The birds had three blown fourth downs early in the game: a blocked punt, a Jalen Hurts sack after a too many men on the field penalty, and a busted run play at the end of the first half in place of an easy field goal.</span>

                              <span>Fifty-three points. That&#x27;s how much Sun Belt juggernaut James Madison University had at halftime against the University of North Carolina on the way to a 70-50 blowout. But that final score does no justice to the absolute ass beating that the Dukes conveyed in Saturday&#x27;s matchup.
That 53 points scored in a half is the most points James Madison has ever scored in one half and the most points North Carolina has ever allowed in a half. It&#x27;s also the most points a power conference team has given up to a Group of 5 team since 2012. James Madison forced four turnovers, including a pick-six and a blocked punt return for a touchdown in just the first half. The Dukes notched five turnovers in total and for added measure—or humiliation—recovered their own surprise onside kick. James Madison quarterback Alonza Barnett III finished the game with seven total touchdowns, breaking the record for most touchdowns by a Dukes quarterback in a single game, going 22-for-34 and 388 total yards, adding two touchdowns off 64 yards on the ground.</span>

                              <span>Last night, going into the midnight hour, I found myself gripped by a Big 12 conference game between two unranked, mediocre teams. This isn&#x27;t atypical for me, particularly this season, but what is unusual is how many others seemed to be watching alongside me based on social media. That&#x27;s the thing about the Colorado Buffaloes, despite how average they are, people can&#x27;t stop watching. We&#x27;re all waiting for something: an implosion, an explosion on the field, a rapper on the sideline, two of the best players in college football, or the Deion reaction cam and postgame presser bait. Most importantly, we&#x27;re watching to see if they win or if they lose.

                              <span>It wasn’t long ago that the Liberty were down bad. In 2017, owner James Dolan kicked the Liberty out of Madison Square Garden and sent them to the Knicks’ G-League arena in White Plains, New York, where they played in front of crowds that you would expect at a rural high school basketball game. The roster fell apart and between 2018 and 2022 they won 47 of 158 games.  
What a difference a change in ownership makes. In 2019, Dolan sold the team to Joseph and Clara Wu Tsai, who moved the Liberty to Brooklyn in 2021. They immediately got to work turning New York into a WNBA super team, plucking MVP winners Breanna Stewart and Jonquel Jones out of free agency, teaming them up with 2020 No. 1 overall pick Sabrina Ionescu and champion point guard Courtney Vandersloot. The results in 2023 were everything they could have expected in the regular season. The Liberty’s quad-star lineup went 32-8 and they outscored opponents by an average of 8.6 points per game.</span>
