                              <span>On Saturday, Colorado won its sixth game of the season against Cincinnati, 34-23. This is notable because it officially makes the team bowl eligible for the first time since 2020 and only the third time since 2007. It is also notable because Sanders&#x27;s method—despite the turnover both by Deion and because of Deion—is working.

                              <span>&quot;That&#x27;s crazy, I can&#x27;t believe that—who is that guy?&quot; Dwyane Wade asked the crowd Sunday at the unveiling of his bronze statue in front of the Miami Heat&#x27;s arena. Who is that guy, indeed. Was Wade a Frasier superfan brought in to celebrate the lifetime achievements of Kelsey Grammer? Was it perhaps a monument to Matrix-era Laurence Fishburne? In time, scholars were able to discern the artists&#x27; intent: to commemorate Wade&#x27;s classic &quot;This is my house&quot; celebration atop a courtside table after a double-overtime game-winner over the Bulls in March 2009.
The statue&#x27;s posture and garments are mostly true to that iconic Wade moment—he was wearing the El Heat jersey the night of the game-winner, though that&#x27;s within the bounds of artistic license. The face, less so. That bold massif of a jawline is disorienting when viewed straight on, but it&#x27;s somewhat more Wade-like when seen from other vantage points. In any case, it was red meat for the Inside the NBA crew on Tuesday&#x27;s broadcast. Kenny Smith insisted that it looked like Wade, just &quot;making an animated face.&quot;</span>

                              <span>In early October, ugly and mysterious posters began popping up around New York City, declaring that a Timothée Chalamet lookalike competition would be taking place on Oct. 27 at 1 p.m. by the Washington Square Arch. A QR code on the posters linked to an event hosted by Partiful, a digital invitation platform which the New York Times has described as “vibey and very Gen-Z coded.” On the morning of the competition, there were well over 2,500 RSVPs on the invitation.
When we decided last week that we were going to the competition, we had a feeling it would bring out all the usual suspects. There would be the online wing of traditional legacy media, of course, but we also knew that this event was going to draw out the TikTokers and niche Substack bloggers like writhing, quivering rats to a trash pile.</span>

Jeffrey Maier grew up, spiritually, to become every single person in this GIF. And all those guys combined, Voltron-style, to become the dude who tried to rip Mookie Betts&#x27;s glove off Tuesday night.

In seeking a unifying theme for what was touted as a cataclysmic collision of styles, coasts, reputations, and economics, the Series has taken … well, not a turn really as much as a slight veer. Even after Tuesday&#x27;s 11-4 victory by the New York Yankees, the series still seems beyond dramaturgy&#x27;s reach. A 3-1 series lead is more full of waiting than proper suspense, and so there’s only so much to anticipate.

                              <span>I interviewed Jerrod Mustaf in 2003. At the time, he was launching a basketball minor league called the Street Basketball Association. I asked Mustaf, a former first-round pick of the New York Knicks whose own playing career ended years earlier after he was tied to an Arizona homicide, if he thought his past would hamper his chances at getting back into the game in any meaningful way.
“The jury’s still out,” he told me.</span>

                              <span>John L. Young called it the Million Dollar Pier, because he said it cost a million dollars to build. That was a lot of money at the time, and so very much something that John L. Young would say. The former lifeguard had been a showman on the Atlantic City boardwalk at various locations, and in 1906 opened his showpiece amusement pier in what was then an up-and-coming New Jersey resort city.
“His twice-daily, deep-sea net hauls were famous, attracting thousands of wide-eyed tourists,” Nelson Johnson writes in Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times And Corruption of Atlantic City. “Wearing knickers, an old sweater and cap, he was a wiry and weathered, red-faced man with sparkling blue eyes, reminiscent of a leprechaun. As he lowered the net to the floor of the pier, Young went into his routine of identifying the sea animals he had caught. It was an animated performance that mesmerized his customers.”</span>

                              <span>In the long and storied history of Barcelona, this past week hardly rates as one of its best. This is a club that has won 27 La Liga trophies, five Champions Leagues, a sextuple, you name it. Two wins in four days is great, and doubly so when considering the opposition, but it&#x27;s still only October, and there are no ticker-tape parades under the Arc de Triomf in October. Nevertheless, Barcelona really needed this exact week, with these exact results, in its efforts to shake off the doldrums that have haunted it in its post–Lionel Messi haze, and at last inaugurate a new era worthy of the best of the old ones.
The week from heaven started in the Champions League on Oct. 23. Barcelona had started this newly formatted tournament with a wet fart, losing 2-1 to Monaco in the opener after Eric García got himself sent off in the 10th minute. Though a 5-0 drubbing of Swiss side Young Boys followed, the level of the opposition meant the match was more or less useless in determining what the ceiling of first-year manager Hansi Flick&#x27;s new-look, refreshed, but still unproven side was going to be. The first serious test came last Wednesday at the hands of Bayern Munich, and it&#x27;s safe to say Barcelona aced it.</span>

                              <span>Before last week, I had a grand total of two gambling/casino experiences to my name, and they were both embarrassing and terrible. There was the time when I completely screwed up a free-money loophole on a betting app and had to sweat out a bunch of stupid college basketball games, and there was the time I went to a wedding in Aurora, Ill. and smashed a beer bottle during a too-enthusiastic swing on a Golden Tee machine.
So when I first heard that Defector was going to Atlantic City for its fall meetings, I was nervous and determined to spend my leisure money only on candy and pinball. I had confidence that I wouldn&#x27;t be tempted to gamble, but I knew casinos and their ilk were dens of trickery, structured to trap you into semi-consciously giving them whole wads of cash. I didn&#x27;t love our odds as a company of surviving the week.</span>

                              <span>Last Friday, Washington Post publisher and CEO Will Lewis announced in an editorial published on the paper&#x27;s website that the Post&#x27;s editorial board would not be endorsing a candidate in the 2024 presidential election, as it has traditionally done. 
The backlash to this decision arrived swiftly and from all directions, thanks largely to reporting from NPR&#x27;s David Folkenflik, who revealed that the editorial board had in fact drafted an endorsement of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris earlier this month. According to Folkenflik&#x27;s reporting, the paper&#x27;s billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, reviewed a draft of the endorsement before Lewis announced that the Post would not be endorsing a candidate this year. Some Post staffers, faced with their publication&#x27;s owner meddling in editorial decisions, revolted. A few published articles criticizing management&#x27;s decision to nix the endorsement, while others submitted letters of resignation. A much bigger and more damaging reaction came from outside the paper: According to Folkenflik, at least 200,000 people have cancelled their digital subscriptions to the Post since the publication of Lewis&#x27;s editorial, a number that represents roughly eight percent of the paper&#x27;s paid circulation.</span>

You might see some things, up to and including the richest man alive showing up and capering about behind Trump like a weird child, but fundamentally people go to these events for the same reason that people stand around in Times Square on New Year&#x27;s Eve, which is to wait for and then witness the one big thing that they know will happen. Taken on its own, there&#x27;s nothing much to the jerky descent of a bedazzled ball at midnight, and probably even less to a peevish former president pivoting disconcertingly from side to side before horking up some undigested chunk of reactionary cable-news gristle at mid-size convention center, but also there doesn&#x27;t really have to be.

                              <span>A RAINFOREST, New Jersey — Last week in Atlantic City, amid discussions of business, enterprise, and strategy, nearly half of the Defector staff convened for fine dining at the exclusive, Michelin-snubbed establishment that is the Rainforest Cafe. Sean, Justin, and I had the unique privilege of shepherding Ray into his first-ever Rainforest Cafe experience, which quickly catapulted him into an abyssal state of misery that persisted despite a glass of the Rainforest Cafe house red. But that is not what I am here to discuss. I am here to discuss the creatures.
As soon as I glimpsed the dark tunnel of vines that connects the Rainforest Cafe gift shop to the Rainforest Cafe restaurant, a threshold I had not crossed since my halcyon days, a question began buzzing in my mind: Which rainforest is the Rainforest Cafe supposed to be? Of course, the most obvious candidate would be the Amazon, the world&#x27;s only A-List rainforest. But I also suspected that Rainforest Cafe may be a product of its time and represent not one particular biome, but rather a melange of all rainforests—the high-concept restaurant equivalent of a Coexist decal.</span>

                              <span>No team karmically deserves a championship, though that sentiment is especially true this year. Neither the Dodgers nor the Yankees chalk up kindly on the moral scale of historic suffering, but, on paper, they can make up for it by promising entertainment for the masses: a powerhouse vs. powerhouse match-up laden with stars. What, then, to make of the fact that one of the purported powerhouses not only currently resembles an ant, but one of those types of ant whose primary defense mechanism is literally exploding?
After falling to a 2-0 series deficit to the Dodgers to open the World Series, the Yankees spent their first game at home making their eventual 4-2 loss feel like a blowout. Now, as per the laws of arithmetic, the Yankees are down 3-0. The sweep alarms are going off! The spaceship is steering itself directly into the sun! The Dodgers have continued getting their postseason success from relatively unexpected corners. The &quot;Three Batters Away&quot;-style FOX chyrons for Shohei Ohtani (though also used for other stars, such as Juan Soto and Bryce Harper) weren&#x27;t paying off even before people started making slow-motion videos of Ohtani&#x27;s backpack-wearing range of motion. Then again, the Dodgers haven&#x27;t needed them to. After all: Freddie Freeman.</span>

                              <span>There has rarely been a shortage of drama in this topsy-turvy Formula 1 season, with no truly boring weekends to speak of since the weather turned warm, but Sunday&#x27;s Mexico City Grand Prix stood out, thanks to chaos up and down the grid. It seemed that every lap had a different combination of drivers trying to ram each other off the road, all while sending aggrieved radio messages like they were going out of style. By the end of the 71 laps, almost every driver had a bone to pick with someone, whether that was an opponent, a teammate, or a pit wall.
The 20th race of the season started with Yuki Tsunoda and Alex Albon making contact before the first turn, landing both drivers with a Did Not Finish, and only got sillier from there. Sergio Pérez continued to be down real bad in what surely has to be his last home race on a top team—it has to be, right? Right?—drawing more notice for calling Liam Lawson an idiot after a scuffle on the track. (Lawson also flipped off Pérez on track; the Australian has been really good at pissing off the old guard, following last week&#x27;s entanglement with Fernando Alonso.) Teammates Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc had a frosty post-race moment, as Ferrari had Leclerc hang back during the race in order to not slow Sainz down, only for Lando Norris to take advantage of the reduced pace and pass the Monegasque driver. Ferrari&#x27;s plan worked, but only for Sainz, who won the day, followed by Norris in second. Leclerc couldn&#x27;t fight back against the McLaren and finished third, although with the fastest lap.</span>

                              <span>Manchester United lost at West Ham 2-1 on Sunday. After equalizing in the 81st minute, the visitors conceded a penalty in the second minute of stoppage time, which Jarrod Bowen converted for the winner. The loss dropped the miserable Red Devils to 14th in the Premier League table, with 11 points in nine matches. Only two clubs in the league have scored fewer goals than United&#x27;s measly eight. On Monday the club announced the dismissal of manager Erik ten Hag, which, well, that makes sense.
In 2022-23, his first full season with the club, Ten Hag led the Red Devils to a League Cup title and a return to Champions League qualification; perhaps just as impressively, he ran off Cristiano Ronaldo and seemed to rejuvenate a moribund Marcus Rashford, who scored 30 goals in all competitions. It&#x27;s been a steep and largely uninterrupted fall since then. Last season United plunged to an eighth-place finish, its lowest since the advent of the Premier League, and squandered that UCL berth, finishing dead last in Group A with four points from six matches and even missing out on the Europa League fallback spot. Rashford regressed; Ten Hag picked a stupid fight with winger Jadon Sancho and banished him from the squad; the Brazilian winger Antony, one of Ten Hag&#x27;s flagship additions, performed abysmally on the field while also facing horrifying domestic violence accusations from an ex-girlfriend and two others.</span>

                              <span>The Cleveland Browns snapped their five-game losing streak on Sunday, upsetting the Baltimore Ravens 29-24 in their first game since quarterback Deshaun Watson tore his Achilles tendon. Beating the best team in the division immediately after losing the quarterback they&#x27;re paying $46 million per season—a mega-contract with two more years on it to which the Browns signed Watson after 22 massage therapists had already filed sexual assault lawsuits against him—is a funny result for a rotten organization, although, as befits the Browns, even the triumph was weird and off-putting. They got the full-strength Jameis Winston experience, as the vet threw his team into and nearly out of a big win.
One week ago, Winston seemed unlikely to see the field this season. The Browns demoted him to emergency QB and listed him as inactive before their Week 7 game against the Cincinnati Bengals, only for emergency to strike. Not only did Watson tear his Achilles in that game, but backup Dorian Thompson-Robinson hurt a finger on his throwing hand after playing two godawful quarters in Watson&#x27;s stead. So the Browns activated Winston and became the first team in 16 years to have three different players attempt double-digit passes in the same game. Winston earned the start this week and instantly cut a weird promo before the game, looking directly into the broadcast camera as he touted his &quot;unwavering faith, ultimate belief, depending on the lord.&quot; He echoed similar sentiments in a signature lacrimal pregame hype speech to his team.</span>

                              <span>Now that Manchester United&#x27;s latest ex-coach Erik ten Hag has been finally been deposed as the world&#x27;s meest verslagen piñata (that&#x27;s &quot;most beaten piñata&quot; for our non-Dutch readership), the new leader in the field of hanging from the rafters and swinging tortuously from side to side is Dallas Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy. There is nobody else even close.
It wasn’t so long ago that we had Robert Saleh, Sheldon Keefe, Christie Sides, and Pedro Grifol. All had high-profile jobs and higher-profile stars—Saleh had the New York Jets and Aaron Rodgers, Keefe had the Toronto Maple Leafs and Auston Matthews, Sides had the Indiana Fever and Caitlin Clark, and Grifol had the Chicago White Sox and, uh, Corey Julks, but also this year’s White Sox were an outlier’s outlier, and so deserve mention all the same.</span>

                              <span>We’re celebrating our first full year of Defector crosswords with a slightly different kind of puzzle than you’re used to, a cryptic by Hoang-Kim Vu. Kim works in global public health in Washington, D.C., and is a member of the crossword editing team at Defector and AVCX. His puzzles have appeared in numerous outlets, including the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and USA Today. We’ll be back to our regularly scheduled programming next week, but thanks for solving along. It’s been a fun year of puzzles.
Defector crosswords, launched in partnership with our friends at AVCX, run every Monday. Launched 16 years ago as the house crossword of The Onion, the AVCX not only offers weekly standard crosswords, but also midi puzzles, a cryptic, a themeless offering, and a trivia contest. Like Defector, AVCX is an independent venture with a fresher sensibility than mainstream outlets, and is committed to diversity in its masthead, fair pay to our contributors, and a fiercely progressive streak. And like Defector, the AVCX relies on subscriptions from solvers like you. If you like Defector&#x27;s puzzles, please consider a subscription with the AVCX.</span>

                              <span>A good Hail Mary looks like chaos, and isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not just a matter of having every receiver sprint to the end zone, chucking the ball up, and hoping for the best. A good Hail Mary is a designed play. Everyone has their spot to be in, their role to play. If it still requires a mini-miracle to complete, well, a good Hail Mary is about shaving off the odds by controlling what you can control. And Washington&#x27;s 52-yard touchdown to beat Chicago 18-15 at the buzzer on Sunday was not merely a good Hail Mary; it was flawless. This [football man voice] is how you draw it up.</span>

                              <span>The Los Angeles Dodgers hold a 2-0 lead in the World Series after Saturday night&#x27;s 4-2 win over the New York Yankees, but the biggest concern right now is the state of Shohei Ohtani&#x27;s labrum. The Dodgers superstar exited the game in the seventh inning after a stolen-base attempt partially dislocated his shoulder.
With two outs in the bottom of the seventh, Ohtani took off for second base and caught his arm awkwardly in the slide. After he was tagged out to end the inning, he stayed on the ground in pain while Dodgers staff attended to him. He then left the field holding his arm and didn&#x27;t return. After Los Angeles escaped a dicey ninth inning to seal the win, manager Dave Roberts shared an update: Ohtani had suffered a left shoulder subluxation, and he would undergo further tests including an MRI on Sunday.</span>
