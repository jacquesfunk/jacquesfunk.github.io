                              <span>Country singer Patrick Haggerty was a stranger to me—yet attending his memorial meant everything. Patrick Haggerty is my favorite kind of icon. He was legendary to some, and unknown to most. His fame came by releasing the first openly gay country record in 1973 titled Lavender Country. The record was released, not through a major or even an independent label, but rather through Seattle&#x27;s Gay Community Social Services at a pressing of just 1,000 copies. According to Haggerty, &quot;we sold them however we could. It was a community effort. We did some public stuff but it was really mostly a matter of word of mouth. People discovered it and turned the next person on to it.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Here we go again. Wondery, which is owned by Amazon, just dropped $100 million for an exclusive distribution and ad sales deal for Jason and Travis Kelce’s podcast New Heights, and I am looking at this news and wondering how the hell this company lost the plot in such a grand fashion. 
Neither the scale nor the cynicism of the deal comes as a surprise. That an industry that has been hemorrhaging ad rates and laying off entire teams of trained professionals has somehow simultaneously managed to scrounge up more than $300 million to shuffle distribution rights for just three shows—New Heights, Dax Shepard’s Armchair Expert, and Alex Cooper’s Call Her Daddy—in the last few months tells you everything you need to know about the values behind these companies’ decisions. More than that, though, the outlandish size of these big swings is an indication of how vague and abstracted a game the biggest players in the podcast business are playing.</span>

                              <span>The National Football Players Association filed a lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court against DraftKings, accusing the sportsbook and daily fantasy operator of breach of contract. At issue is an apparent attempt by DraftKings to wriggle out of millions of dollars in licensing fees it allegedly owes the NFLPA as part of the gambling company&#x27;s failed NFT venture, Reignmakers.
The complaint (embedded below) says that DraftKings &quot;placed a large bet on the future of non-fungible tokens (NFTs)&quot; with its Reignmakers program, one which involved committing &quot;substantial guaranteed payments&quot; to the NFLPA in order to license the names, images, and likenesses (NIL) of current NFL players. DraftKings abruptly shut down the Reignmakers program at the end of July, after three years of relatively stable operation, stranding its base of players with vast holdings of worthless digital tokens, and attempted to terminate its NIL contract with the NFLPA. The NFLPA, in its lawsuit, says DraftKings &quot;assumed the risks inherent in its product&quot; when it leapt into the horseshit NFT business, and should not be allowed to back out of guaranteed payments now that the scam has failed.</span>

                              <span>We have cheerfully enmeshed ourselves in the saga of the Chicago White Sox all summer largely for reasons of handy mockability—last night&#x27;s suspended game against Texas, for instance, lasted only four pitches and one minute before the umpires invoked Rule 13:08, which reads, &quot;What are we even doing here?&quot;
We do this because it is the right thing to do, and also because it is our job, but we now have a more developed sense of empathy for the Sox and their exhausted elastic. There is, it turns out, a worse team out there.</span>

                              <span>The moment the U.S. Open draw was revealed, I sought out Naomi Osaka&#x27;s name, eager to see who the two-time champion and loser of my second-favorite match of the year would face in the tournament&#x27;s first round. Her comeback season has been stippled with seemingly equal amounts of tremendous near-misses, encouraging results, and frustrating setbacks, with her highest level only occasionally poking up above the surface, as great as ever. I could not have dreamed up as tantalizing a matchup as she actually had.
Opposite her on Tuesday was Jelena Ostapenko, the Latvian trigger-puller whose defiance of fashion, match, and social norms makes her appointment viewing, even when she&#x27;s not taking on a four-time Grand Slam champion. Both players hit the tennis ball as if trying to vaporize it, both have had uneven years, and both have higher risk tolerances than most. It promised to be a tennis match for the firearms enthusiasts, more or less. First to 100 unforced errors loses, that sort of thing. Instead, Osaka swept Ostapenko off the court with a dominant 6-3, 6-2 win in just 64 minutes. She made just five unforced errors, all in the second set, as she picked up her first top-10 win since January 2020.</span>

                              <span>Diana Nyad is one of the greatest swimmers America ever produced. Just ask her, or see Nyad, the mythmaking, Oscar-nominated biopic built around her 2013 Cuba-to-Florida swim. 
But lots of folks in the open-water swimming realm prefer to see her as one of this sportsworld&#x27;s biggest frauds, and, as a 1979 Sports Ilustrated story described Nyad, &quot;a very mediocre swimmer with a very good publicist.&quot; A new lawsuit favors the negative characterizations. The suit accuses Steven Munatones, a swimming influencer and a significant architect of the flattering side of Nyad&#x27;s public image—he served as a consultant on the feature film glorifying her greatest/most fraudulent swim—with going to great and unethical lengths to enhance her athletic legacy. Among the allegations against him: Munatones faked the existence of a sanctioning organization to lend credibility to Nyad&#x27;s controversial Cuba-to-Florida swim, and digitally defiled a marathon swimming database in a brazen attempt to rewrite the sport’s history in Nyad&#x27;s favor.</span>

Sectors that will not be impacted are: agriculture, healthcare, construction, and food security.

Speaking for myself, the workers do not deserve the racist invective hurled at them. The blame lays at the employers deliberately exploiting the program. The FWP system is a current favourite racist bugbear for many white Canadians.</span>

Abstract: 

Painters are masters of depiction and have learned to evoke a clear perception of materials and material attributes in a natural, three-dimensional setting, with complex lighting conditions. Furthermore, painters are not constrained by reality, meaning that they could paint materials without exactly following the laws of nature, while still evoking the perception of materials. Paintings have to our knowledge not been studied on a big scale from a material perception perspective. In this article, we studied the perception of painted materials and their attributes by using human annotations to find instances of 15 materials, such as wood, stone, fabric, etc. Participants made perceptual judgments about 30 unique segments of these materials for 10 material attributes, such as glossiness, roughness, hardness, etc. We found that participants were able to perform this task well while being highly consistent. Participants, however, did not consistently agree with each other, and the measure of consistency depended on the material attribute being perceived. Additionally, we found that material perception appears to function independently of the medium of depiction—the results of our principal component analysis agreed well with findings in former studies for photographs and computer renderings.

                              <span>The days leading up to and immediately following the 20 rounds of the Major League Baseball draft are some of the most intense and stressful in the baseball calendar. The games that big-league teams are playing around then have a familiar bleary early-summer insignificance, but their front offices are sifting through data and scouting reports before drafting a combined 600 players to try and set the course for the future of the franchise. The 2024 draft introduced a new element of stress into this equation, with new organizational rules limiting how many players a team can have in their system. Per these rules, for every player drafted and signed, another must be cut. “You have to ask yourself a question as you’re going through a 20-round draft,” one team employee told me. “Who is this guy that I’m drafting replacing in our organization? You have to have around 20 guys that you’re willing to let go of.”
When Major League Baseball and the Minor League Baseball Players Association ratified their bargaining agreement prior to the 2023 season, the league agreed to improve living conditions for minor leaguers, offering a higher quality of food, giving them the rights to their name, image, and likeness, promising not to cut any more minor league teams for the duration of the agreement, and paying out dramatic increases in annual salary. The league agreed to all that under one condition: the ability to cap a team&#x27;s domestic rosters, first at 180 players in 2023 and then at 165 for 2024 and beyond.</span>

                              <span>Hello! Let me start with a confession: When I was asked to guest-host the Funbag I figured it would be pretty easy, given the fact that I’ve written an advice column of my own on and off for the past six or seven years. How different could it be? Well, it turns out that having a facility for firmly but gently telling depressed socialists to get over themselves and ask someone out doesn’t help much when it comes to answering questions about front-office management techniques or, bizarrely, deciding who in recent history had the most skin. (I’m sorry, Michael, but I do not know. Surely someone large, or with a rare medical condition.)
Anyway, I tried my best. Please forgive me for not weighing in on the Mariners’ decision to fire Scott Servais. I did manage to have a very good time with this.</span>

                              <span>Don&#x27;t judge &quot;Don&#x27;t judge a book by its cover&quot; by its cover. I mean that in the specific and general senses, as a book cover can answer many questions about what&#x27;s going on in there: What feeling does this book hope to evoke? And what other works does this book want to, visually, place itself alongside? Consider the phenomenon of the blob.
If you perused a bookstore&#x27;s new fiction section anytime between 2019 and 2023, you probably saw a bunch of books festooned by indistinct, pastely swatches of color. A bunch of smart, incisive things have been written about the color blob trend over the course of its moment as the book cover trend du too many jours, and the template was so ubiquitously adhered to that you didn&#x27;t even have to have read You Exist Too Much or The Vanishing Half to have understood its deal. Book cover design, like any other field of design, moves in waves. While the color blob was preceded by the two-dimensional color block meta and the headless woman fad, there are some particularities to note. Blobwave&#x27;s rise was contemporaneous with that of algorithmic book-buying, both on Amazon and on social media, and as Print noted three years ago, color blob design represented a &quot;&#x27;safe&#x27; route disproportionately taken in service of women of color and debut authors.&quot;</span>

                              <span>With only three episodes under its belt, Industry Season 3 has been going at warp speed with drama, shakeups, and plot, plot, plot. Practically an entire season&#x27;s worth of story has happened with nearly every character already. Just thinking about where things could possibly go from here overwhelms me. With that in mind, let&#x27;s check back in on our beloved characters&#x27; delightfully volatile trajectories.
Harper Stern: Going Up! Up! Up! Harperhive, we are so back! And we are eating good in this neighborhood. Last week, she was scratching that girlboss itch with Petra Koenig that had been dormant for so long, already showing that she has not learned a thing after being fired from Pierpoint, and salivating for her moment of revenge. She helped Petra undermine their boss Anna by balancing out Lumi&#x27;s nosediving stock and got her an advantageous price by doing a little cheating. But last week was merely an appetizer for Harper&#x27;s full supervillain pivot on Sunday. Her and Petra test the waters of striking out on their own and right when it looked like it was going to blow up on the launchpad, she decides to put all the chips on the table and make her move in public, bridge-burning fashion. And not only is she rewarded for this, with a billionaire benefactor who seems to favor her even more than Petra, but she gets the added benefit of forcing Pierpoint&#x27;s (and specifically Eric&#x27;s) hand by becoming a client. Harper played the hits in this episode and it was absolute magic, showing a wolfish delight in forcing Eric to bend the knee, puppet-mastering her supposed friend Yasmin and business partner Petra, and winning the respect of Otto Mostyn. Her downfall is inevitable and will be one for the ages certainly, but for the moment, Harper and the Harper fanbase are shining bright like a diamond.</span>

                              <span>Last week I traveled to Tuscany, the birthplace of the Renaissance, the home of Chianti, land of cobblestones and no air conditioning and extremely rare T-bone steaks. What better place to expand your palate and acquaint yourself with new ways of tasting, living, being? What better place to mix one of the most cursed beverages known to mankind: Gatorwine?
I met up with my best friend and some of her friends, who have a tradition of trying horrifying drink combinations; some of their greatest hits include BORG night and Flamin&#x27; Hot Mountain Dew night. When we met, they were reviewing the Monster Energy gelato they had just tried (disgusting, allegedly). So it was a natural segue to talk about their next culinary conquest for the trip.</span>

                              <span>It is unwise to expect too much from August baseball. The new car smell of a season built on hope is gone, the daily grind of playing in 102-degree heat and 98 percent humidity has become oppressive, and the significant stuff doesn’t start until next month. The most you can really expect from the fauna who bring us baseball is strictly improv. Not pure athleticism, which we can see every day in every other sport, or jaw-slackening power, which we see every day from Aaron Judge, or even child-searing heartbreak, which is implicit if we are for whatever macabre reason watching Little League baseball on television. And this doesn’t even include the White Sox, who are plenty weird but also exist in context and in any event are still 19 losses away from their own version of nirvana. What you want, and the best you might get, is something inconsequential that you will most likely never see again.
So we should start with Danny Jansen, who became the first player in MLB history to play for both teams in the same game on Monday. You likely already know this, because we&#x27;ve had days to prepare for it—and, given that it’s August and all, because there has been plenty of coverage from a baseball media reduced to waiting for its local team&#x27;s next soon-to-be-failed phenom to be promoted from Double-A. Jansen had just fouled off the first pitch he saw while batting for Toronto against the Red Sox in Fenway Park on June 26 when a storm blew up the game; when it was resumed 61 days later, Jansen found himself catching the conclusion of his at-bat for those very Sox, who acquired him at the trade deadline exactly a month earlier. He struck himself out, with Daulton Varsho playing the role Jansen originated; Jansen convinced Nick Pivetta to beat Faux Jansen with a four-seam fastball and a slider in the dirt.</span>

                              <span>In a thread on BlueSky, political science professor Dave Karpf dissects Nate Silver&#x27;s new doorstop of a book on gambling and risk, and finds several interesting - and disturbing - things within.
Probably the biggest (and where the thread title comes from) is the revelation that Silver was betting 7 figures on the NBA at the same time that 538 under his leadership was undergoing mass layoffs. Karpf also notes that the venture capital chapter focuses around Palantir founder (and his new boss) Peter Thiel, as well as Silver&#x27;s lack of consideration of systemic risk.</span>

&quot;This is a historic moment for the California Condor Recovery Program and the Los Angeles Zoo&#x27;s animal care team,&quot; Rose Legato, curator of birds at the LA Zoo, says in the statement. &quot;Our condor team has raised the bar once again in the collaborative effort to save America&#x27;s largest flying bird from extinction. What we are seeing now are the benefits of new breeding and rearing techniques developed and implemented by our team.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Finding a therapist who takes your insurance can be nearly impossible. NPR reports on a ProPublica investigation into why therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists are leaving insurance networks and only accepting cash for treatment.
You may not be surprised to learn that the primary cause is that insurance companies are actively trying to avoid paying for mental health treatment. As insurance networks add more ghost therapists and refuse to raise reimbursement rates, many independent mental health providers have stopped taking insurance entirely. I definitely noticed this in my recent search for a mental health provider, none of the psychiatrists I looked into would accept insurance for initial payment (but some were in network and would help file for reimbursement).</span>

                              <span>Kelsey Plum spent much of this past Wednesday&#x27;s Lynx-Aces game complaining to and about the refs. She brought up uneven officiating in a halftime sideline interview: The Lynx “move on all their screens.” But by the time the postgame press conference started, the Vegas guard had somewhat changed her tune. “She cooked me,” Plum said, trying to explain Minnesota guard Courtney Williams&#x27;s 22-point performance that night. “She had it tonight, and when you get your ass kicked, you gotta give the other people credit.”
That&#x27;s one reason not to read too much into that game, and why I felt uncomfortable using it to construct some broader point about the Las Vegas Aces&#x27; defense, which dominated last season but has so far disappointed in 2024. Sometimes other team will just shoot well. The Lynx finished 11-for-19 from behind the arc in their 98-87 win on Wednesday. Williams indeed cooked Plum, but as head coach Becky Hammon pointed out afterward, Williams almost exclusively takes the “long, off-the-dribble twos” teams can live with giving up. Minnesota punished every botched defensive rotation—the same thing they&#x27;ve done to 10 other teams. That probably says more about the Lynx than it does about the Aces.</span>

                              <span>Welcome to Margin of Error, a politics column from Tom Scocca, editor of the Indignity newsletter, examining the apocalyptic politics and coverage of Campaign 2024.
The Robert F. Kennedy Jr. presidential campaign, in its final incarnation, pretty clearly seemed to be illegal and unconstitutional. It feels petty and niggling to talk about details like that, next to the delusions of grandeur that got Kennedy so much attention and publicity. Here was an avatar of how antivax conspiracies and other antisocial quackery operate as a political force. Here was billionaire money in a state of such unhinged entitlement that it could prop up a naked spoiler campaign and profess to be performing a public service. Here was, God willing, the last cooling and crumbling briquette of the Kennedy family&#x27;s long-burning equity as an electoral brand name.</span>

                              <span>This past Friday, Fanatics refiled its May lawsuit against Arizona Cardinals rookie Marvin Harrison Jr., adding two new counts and naming his father as a new defendant. As Fanatics wrote in the amended complaint, the involvement of multiple Marvins Harrison helped facilitate and further their alleged defrauding of one of the most loathed companies in sports.
At issue in the initial suit was a contract dispute between Harrison Jr. and Fanatics over a name, image, and likeness (NIL) term sheet the two parties agreed to in 2023, before Harrison Jr. got to the NFL. Fanatics claims that this document is legally binding—in the suit, the company repeatedly refers to it in headline case as a Binding Term Sheet, though traditionally what differentiates a term sheet from a contract is that the former is not legally binding—and that Harrison Jr. has not fulfilled his obligations under it. Harrisons Jr. and Sr. posit, in return, that as they only signed a term sheet and not a contract, they do not in fact have a binding deal with Fanatics.</span>

                              <span>No pro wrestler thrives more off making you believe that he&#x27;s about to be maimed than Bryan Danielson. Selling the damage of a match is a non-negotiable part of the job for anyone in the business, but for Danielson, acting out his character&#x27;s pain feels almost like an act of sadism. He&#x27;s 43 years old, near the end of a full-time run that began 25 years ago, and still carrying the weight of a multi-year hiatus due to a little thing called &quot;career-ending&quot; concussion problems. Particularly after making the move from the PG WWE to PG-13 AEW in 2021, his matches became bloodier, grittier, and more of a high-wire act for his visibly deteriorating body.
While Danielson&#x27;s time with the company has cemented his legacy, his road with AEW has also been continually blocked by legitimate injuries, like the broken arm he suffered during a PPV main event last summer (he finished the match) or the broken orbital bone he picked up in the fall shortly after returning. Mixed in with those real-life scares, however, have been creative choices that prey on the emotions they&#x27;ve stirred—mid-match doctor checks, mimed fencing responses, and this drama, following a PPV match in April.</span>

                              <span>Paul Skenes of the Pittsburgh Pirates may win the National League Rookie of the Year. In one of the most fucked-up baseball developments I can remember, Skenes has only allowed more than three runs in a start once all season, and has not failed to pitch at least five complete innings since his first appearance with the Pirates, way back on May 11. He has more starts where he has allowed zero runs (four) than starts where he has allowed more than two runs (three). He doesn&#x27;t qualify for any of the Baseball Reference leaderboards, but his 11.3 strikeouts per nine innings would rank second in the National League behind only Chris Sale of the Braves, and his .942 WHIP would be good for second in the majors, behind only Seattle&#x27;s Logan Gilbert. He&#x27;s just over a year from his first-ever professional appearance, and he&#x27;s already one of the handful of best pitchers in baseball.
Given all of that, it&#x27;s possibly freakier to suggest that Skenes might not win Rookie of the Year. He might not! Jackson Merrill, the extremely cool rookie center fielder for the Padres, is mounting a charge. He&#x27;s more than held his own as a 21-year-old natural shortstop playing the most important outfield position, and his consistent and solid offensive production has been clutch for an otherwise top-heavy Padres lineup thinned out by key injuries. Baseball Reference says there are 23 fellows in the majors who&#x27;ve played at least 80 games in center field this season, and among that group Merrill ranks fourth in OPS+, and is tops in the National League. The only center fielder in baseball who has driven in more runs this season than Merrill is Aaron damn Judge.</span>

                              <span>My colleague Lauren Theisen mused to me earlier this season that there should be a phrase for when Aaron Judge and Juan Soto homer in the same game, a thing that has now happened 12 times this year. I appreciate the impulse; baseball doesn&#x27;t become mythos without a cool nickname. What would the Bash Brothers or Murderers&#x27; Row be without their names? Just some guys hitting home runs. But the Judge-Soto pairing&#x27;s demand for a moniker lacks staying power—to the looming distress of Yankees fans—given Soto&#x27;s willingness to enter a true free agency.
This does not mean our duties to dinger nomenclature are discharged. The heart of the Yankees&#x27; order threw down the gauntlet on Sunday, with Soto, Judge, and Giancarlo Stanton hitting three straight home runs in the seventh inning of a one-run game to help put away the Rockies, 10-3.</span>

                              <span>With scant guidance for how to handle copyright requests for AI-generated works, the law is playing catch-up. As copyright offices around the world have consistently denied protections to AI art, you run across phrases like “the copyrightability of the monkey’s work,” as judges ruling on lawsuits are forced to rely on case law related to crested macaque photographers. And that’s not even close to the weirdest precedent cited. 
The 2023 case Thaler v. Perlmutter dealt with a copyright battle over an AI-generated picture. In ruling for the U.S. Copyright Office and its refusal to grant copyright protection, District Court Judge Beryl A. Howell wrote that a copyright has never been granted to “a work originating with a non-human.” To support this, Judge Howell called back to an 83-year-old case, Oliver v. Saint Germain Foundation, which involved a legal battle over a book purportedly dictated by an ancient Atlantean spirit. The story behind that book, and that case, is worth telling on its own merits.</span>
