                              <span>The NWSL Championship could not have worked out better for the league. The best team in the league, the Orlando Pride, beat the Washington Spirit, 1-0, in front of a sell-out crowd. Marta, the best women’s player in history, won her first NWSL title while her mother was in attendance for the first time. Rookie sensation and MVP candidate Barbra Banda scored the game’s decisive goal. It was a good day for the NWSL, and women’s soccer, but it did not remove the season’s blemishes. None are bigger than the pending lawsuit against the San Diego Wave and the league itself, which alleges multiple forms of discrimination and negligence.
On July 3, a former Wave employee named Brittany Alvarado went public with a statement on Twitter. She accused team president Jill Ellis and the Wave of fostering an abusive environment, and the NWSL of improperly addressing the abusive leadership under Ellis. The Wave went on the attack, denying wrongdoing and threatening legal action. A week later, Ellis made good on the threat, and sued Alvarado for defamation.</span>

                              <span>For everything astonishing about the average Saquon Barkley touchdown run, the most uncanny is how natural it all looks. It is not, of course; on the merits, and even by the absurd standards for this kind of thing that apply in the NFL and basically nowhere else on earth, it just does not really compute to see someone Barkley&#x27;s size moving through space with the speed and precision with which he does those things. But if the particulars don&#x27;t really make sense on their own, the little narrative of Barkley&#x27;s long runs is entirely coherent, just in the sense that they just sort of seem like what would happen when you hand a football to someone who can do all that stuff. They are dazzling to the point of being implausible, but they make sense.
There is a lot of meaningful context on both sides of the ball on all of these runs, and some broader and less meaningful historical context trailing Barkley into the huddle on every play. The Los Angeles Rams talked about bad gap discipline on the 70- and 72-yard rushing touchdowns that Barkley had against them in the second half of Philadelphia&#x27;s 37-20 win on Sunday night, and Coach Sean McVay was forced out into the more literary extremes of coaching syntax—crediting Barkley with &quot;erasing angles&quot; and the like—in giving credit where it was due. But even bearing in mind that none of it is as simple as it looks, it is astonishing how simple this looks:</span>

                              <span>The squirting cucumber Ecballium—not to be confused with the exploding cucumber Cyclanthera—is not a showy plant. It meanders on a vine on the ground, sprouting craggly green leaves and demure yellow flowers. Neither are Ecballium&#x27;s fruits memorable to look at; the pale, bristly green pods are around the size of erasers and dangle glumly off their stems. But once ripe, the fruits will burst at a single touch, jettisoning a gloppy stream of seeds that can reach speeds of nearly 45 miles per hour and land 30 feet away from the plant. Today, a new paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences explains the mechanisms behind the squirting cucumber&#x27;s fine-tuned ballistics.
The seeds of the paper were sown in the summer of 2022, when Chris Thorogood, the head of science at the Oxford Botanic Garden and an author on the paper, brought three mathematicians and one physicist to an unassuming patch of cucumbers. &quot;Cucumbers aren’t normally very interesting,&quot; Derek Moulton, an applied mathematician at the University of Oxford and an author on the paper, wrote in an email. When Thorogood bent down to squeeze a fruit, &quot;you could hear a tiny little squirt,&quot; Moulton said. But no one actually saw anything, leading Moulton to assume the squeezed cucumber was a dud.</span>

                              <span>Due to a feat of collective willpower this website is not a 24/7 Nikola Jokic propaganda outlet. The Denver Nuggets center is averaging 30 points, 14 rebounds, and 11 assists on 67 percent true shooting; he&#x27;s on track for his fourth MVP in five seasons; he performs so many spectacular feats on a nightly basis that he&#x27;s raised the standard for his own newsworthiness. It may then seem strange that we&#x27;ve opted to show you, of all things, a Jokic missed field goal attempt from Saturday night&#x27;s 127-102 win over the Lakers. However!
With just 0.3 seconds on the clock in the third quarter, Jokic asked his teammate Peyton Watson to &quot;put it up,&quot; pointing his finger. Watson obliged, inbounded the ball at head height, and Jokic nearly volleyball-served it the length of the court and into the hoop.</span>

                              <span>A few weeks ago, after a grindhouse 94-90 win against the Pacers, second-year Orlando guard Anthony Black was asked about his team&#x27;s defensive performance, and he provided a succinct thesis statement on what makes the team special. &quot;It feels good, feeling their frustration with each other,&quot; Black said. &quot;Just seeing the looks on their faces is definitely something we talk about. Pressure, relentless pressure. I think that&#x27;s what we brought tonight, and I think throughout the game that breaks teams down, and when they get to that breaking point, they break.&quot; In other words, to play the Magic is to feel pain, to squirm against a force that is trying to constrict you until you turn purple and croak.
And thus far through the young season, opponents have croaked. Orlando is 11-7, third in both the Eastern Conference standings and defensive rating in the NBA. In a conference otherwise populated by mounds of butt, the Magic are the one cool young team breaking out. While would-be contenders in Milwaukee and New York are slowly righting the ship, the young wingspan freaks in Orlando are playing the conference&#x27;s best defense by a whopping five points per possession and consolidating last season&#x27;s breakout campaign, developing into an ambitious team with a clear identity.</span>

                              <span>Welcome to Perfectly Fine Dinner Party Club, a cooking and hosting column from Libby Watson, who likes to throw dinner parties but is normal about it.
A quick thank-you to people who emailed me about bo ssam! I would especially like to shout out Jerry, who said the post inspired him to invite new neighbors over for dinner, which is just the most lovely thing I&#x27;ve ever heard. He also shared a really great recipe for a cucumber kimchi, which his Korean mom calls &quot;quick kimchi,&quot; that I will be making myself. I&#x27;ll share it at the bottom of this post. I also received a great email from Samuel, telling me to do as the Times recipe suggested and serve the pork with raw oysters. I am unfortunately a little chicken-nuggies-and-chips baby who doesn&#x27;t like seafood, but I will share his suggestion with you all so that it wasn&#x27;t in vain. He correctly advises that &quot;if you want to impress people, sit them down in front of a big table of all the bo ssam fixins and then start shucking oysters next to them like you run an ice bar on the bayou.&quot; Do the voice too. Say stuff about gators. It&#x27;ll be fun.</span>

                              <span>The New York Football (So To Speak) Giants still have that dawg in them, trust us. They&#x27;ve just moved on from the mundane world of victory and defeat to the loftier pursuit of indiscriminate shame-flinging. Nobody can rip them better or faster than they can do it themselves, and they added the magic ingredient of unbroadcastable profanity to make it stick. Having that dawg doesn’t necessarily mean it is housebroken.
After their weekly pantsing, a 30-7 loss to Tampa Bay that featured Tommy DeVito looking like the winner of a North Jersey Daniel Jones play-alike contest and the defense retreating early and often as is the Giants&#x27; traditional wont, several team employees lined up to gently debate the intensely personal art of observational quitting. That is, they started pointing fingers everywhere and nowhere simultaneously, with the attached benefit of piquant naughty words for added authenticity.</span>

                              <span>The Commanders had what looked like a choice match-up at home against Cooper Rush and the three-win Cowboys on Sunday—a gift of the schedule that could have been a get-right game after two straight tough losses to very good opponents. But rather than reassert themselves as the upstart team that impressed so much in the early part of the season, Washington spent a long time doing nothing much at all. As the Dallas pressure injured running back Brian Robinson and contained QB Jayden Daniels, inhibiting his ability to either look downfield or scramble, the score was a meager 3-3 at halftime, and with 11 minutes to go in the fourth, fans had just witnessed five straight punts while the Cowboys held a 10-9 lead. That&#x27;s when the game suddenly turned into chaos.
With a Dallas field goal off some good field position, a Washington fumble, and a Rush pass to a completely uncovered Luke Schoonmaker in the end zone, the &#x27;boys seemingly took control. Under pressure to score, the &#x27;mmanders found their tempo and took bite after bite out of the field until they were rewarded with eight points. On the ensuing kickoff, KaVontae Turpin muffed the catch, picked the ball up, and used a vicious spin move to open a lane that stretched the remaining length of the field. Washington hurried a field goal to cut it to it 27-20 with under two minutes to play, the Cowboys took the clock down to 40 seconds with a three-and-out, and so the Commanders had about half a minute and 86 yards to go for a miracle.</span>

                              <span>Who is the real Tottenham Hotspur? Is it the team that&#x27;s picked up five early-season losses in the Premier League, most recently and most ignominiously a 2-1 home defeat to Ipswich Town, the newly promoted Tractor Boys&#x27; only win? Maybe, but Tottenham is also, and perhaps first and foremost, a giant thorn in Manchester City&#x27;s side, and Saturday&#x27;s 4-0 drubbing of the reigning champions, at those reigning champions&#x27; home stadium, might be more representative of Tottenham&#x27;s potential and peak, if not their consistent form.

                              <span>Before Saturday’s NWSL championship-deciding match between the Orlando Pride and the Washington Spirit, Brazilian legend Marta reflected on her journey with Orlando, where she’s played since 2017, the club’s second-ever season in existence. As the only remaining player from that squad, she told Sandra Herrera that she’s asked herself, “Why? Why am I still looking to do something special here?”
The journey hasn’t been an easy one. The Pride had only made the playoffs once before this year, back in Marta’s first season in 2017. Despite star-laden squads led by the likes of Alex Morgan, Ali Krieger, Sydney Leroux, Ali Riley, and Marta herself, Orlando never could quite form a team greater than the sum of its most impressive parts. Until this season, that is, when Marta, Orlando, and maybe even the NWSL as a whole all found the success they’d long been working for.</span>

                              <span>Max Verstappen claimed his fourth consecutive championship Saturday night, at the conclusion of the Las Vegas Grand Prix. Verstappen came into the race 62 points clear of Lando Norris with three races to go; some truly improbable stuff would&#x27;ve needed to happen over the season&#x27;s remaining few weeks for Norris to complete the overtake, but at a minimum the McLaren driver needed to finish ahead of Verstappen in Vegas. He could not. Verstappen cruised home in sixth place, half a minute ahead of seventh-place Norris, who surrendered late and took an extra pit stop in order to pursue the point for fastest lap on fresh soft tires, his McLaren team having shifted its attention to holding off Ferrari in the constructor standings.
It was a somewhat anticlimactic conclusion to a championship chase that juiced up the middle third of a Formula 1 season that in its early stages looked like another dreary Red Bull cakewalk. Even as the McLaren plot-line fizzled and it became clear into autumn that Norris&#x27;s title hopes rested upon Verstappen&#x27;s car kerploding at some point and then continuing to kerplode on an almost weekly basis, there was still fun to be had in Red Bull&#x27;s mounting frustration and increasingly visible dysfunction. Then Verstappen had one of the most impressive races of his career in a soaked and chaotic São Paolo Grand Prix, releasing a lot of pressurized angst and giving his inevitable fourth championship its signature moment. São Paolo at least delivered the thrills, even if it all but ended the underdog charge that gave the season its flavor. A Norris win in Las Vegas would&#x27;ve prolonged the chase, but not for very long.</span>

                              <span>Some human bodies are not meant to endure a full 82-game NBA regular season. It&#x27;s not necessarily the marker of doom it may seem. Bill Walton never could, and he won an MVP award, a Finals MVP award, two titles, and made the Hall of Fame. Tracy McGrady, a fellow Hall-of-Famer, never suited up for 82 games in any of his 16 NBA seasons. Joel Embiid, with two scoring titles and an MVP under his belt at age 30, hasn&#x27;t yet managed it, and almost certainly never will. You can be a great player without ever exactly being an every-night player. Zion Williamson can still be great.
That&#x27;s the thing I keep repeating to myself, in the manner of one who recites comforting air-travel safety statistics immediately after having watched both of his plane&#x27;s wings shear off at 39,000 feet, when I read that Williamson&#x27;s latest leg injury has not responded as hoped to &quot;multiple treatments&quot; and that he is &quot;not close to a return to action.&quot; Williamson started the season with a sore left leg, and then on Nov. 6 he tweaked his hamstring. He returned on Nov. 9 and played well in a loss. Williamson says he &quot;felt fine&quot; after this game, but during treatment the next day he felt &quot;more sore here than usual,&quot; and was told after a checkup that he&#x27;d suffered a strain and would be ruled out indefinitely. It&#x27;s been two weeks, and now someone wants Shams to spread the word that fans should not expect Zion to return to the court anytime soon, despite several different attempts having been made at healing that hamstring.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s fun to speculate about bad team chemistry. Sometimes the sideline body language is revealing enough. Sometimes you get an uncharacteristically detailed and cogent Shams Charania report, like the one the Sixers suffered last week. Sometimes you can figure it out in the circuitous sentences of beat reporters, who are too polite or compromised to say it outright. And sometimes it can be deduced from the mere presence of Rudy Gobert, a man so unpopular among his colleagues that ESPN tried to learn why at feature length. Even as the team around him has changed, Gobert is still Gobert, with charisma about as strong as his low-post repertoire.
This offseason&#x27;s trade between the Knicks and Wolves was, in some ways, trading like for like. One offensively gifted, sporadically infuriating big man was swapped for another, Julius Randle to Minnesota and Karl-Anthony Towns to New York. All things considered, the Towns-Gobert pairing was a pretty successful experiment, schematically and interpersonally. But Randle is a bit more dour than the man he was replacing. Gobert-Randle had tremendous grump-on-grump potential, and we&#x27;re starting to see it, eight wins and seven losses into a Wolves campaign against a very soft slate of opponents.</span>

                              <span>Looks like Adam Silver is out there again, tinkering away and trying to fix that rusted out old heap in the driveway that hasn&#x27;t run right in years and has a wasp hive nestled against the drivetrain after years of inactivity. In other words, he&#x27;s messing around with the All-Star Game.
Credit to him for trying, anyway. Silver is nothing if not persistent, and at his pay grade as commissioner of your National Basketball Association, he&#x27;d damned well better be. He is already being given credit for the largely illusory benefits of the in-season tournament, which is mostly just a tribute to schedule manipulation (good games between good teams are always that, Emirates branding be damned), some gym floor murals by 12-year-olds with an unlimited supply of spray paint, and a trophy nobody has any particular attachment to. But Silver does understand that customers will buy anything they can be fooled into thinking is worth the attention span. The challenge, where the All-Star Game is concerned, is that no one is fooled.</span>

                              <span>JERSEY CITY, N.J. — You&#x27;re probably going to have a good time at the independent wrestling show.
Just a few small things need to go your way: It shouldn&#x27;t be longer than three hours; the matches should have a decent pace to them; the venue should have air conditioning; and the largest, sweatiest, most obnoxious men should avoid standing directly in front of you. Nail all these parts, and I can almost guarantee you that something will click. Maybe the entrances will remind you of a drag show. Maybe the flips will take your breath away. Maybe you&#x27;ll love trying to decipher the inner workings of the performance. Maybe you&#x27;ll really like gawking at shirtless men from so close.</span>

Playing 14 head-to-head games in Singapore over two and a half weeks, Ding is looking to correct his post-title form slump, while Gukesh could become the 18th world chess champion at just 18 years of age.
The chess is back! Let’s go!</span>

                              <span>As fans in America, it&#x27;s important to remain grateful for the ease with which we can indulge a truly gluttonous appetite for elite soccer, our consumption unshackled from the regional restrictions, splintered broadcast rights, and timezone issues that make it much more difficult for everyone else to watch as much of the best teams and leagues as we can. That being said, I do regret the fact that it&#x27;s recently become a lot harder to keep up with the international game stateside.
For a couple years now I&#x27;ve spent most midseason international breaks spotting tasty UEFA Nations League matchups and CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifiers on the schedule, only to learn that watching them would require expanding my already bloated streaming service subscriptions to divorce-threatening levels. I&#x27;m about as motivated a soccer fan as there is, and yet even I refuse to stump up for the Fubos and Vixes and Fox Soccer Pluses of the world, especially when you can&#x27;t even rely on those services to air every match in the competitions they have the rights to. It&#x27;s gotten to the point where I&#x27;ve now all but given up even thinking about catching non-tournament national team games.</span>

                              <span>People who we hate—this is as opposed to people, comma, who we hate—like to criticize Al Michaels for not seeming properly effusive about some idiotic false start penalty in a nothing vs. nothing game, played on a Thursday night and aired on Jeff Bezos&#x27;s principal home surveillance tool. This is all fair, although to be frank, Michaels has seen everything a thousand times during his long career; it would be not just weird but worrying if he was hooting and hollering over the ordinary nonsense like some unhinged post-Ritalin Kevin Harlan. It’s just the Jaguars on a weeknight, and also the man just turned 80.
But Thursday night&#x27;s Steelers-Browns game, a blizzard that happened to feature yard lines and penalty flags, turned Michaels absolutely giddy. The ultimate broadcasting lifer became your 7-year-old on Christmas morning, full of wonder and delight and processed sugar, tucking into his gig as if every play was a hunk of prime rib with a double-baked tater the size of your spaniel&#x27;s head and a Balvenie on the side, neat—all fed to him forkful by straining forkful by Jane Fonda circa Barbarella.</span>

I. Murmillones
The kings of the arena. Armed with a short sword, protected by a shield and a bracer on his sword arm, and decked out in an extravagant, often fish-themed helmet, there&#x27;s a reason you think of the murmillo when you think of gladiators: They look fucking awesome. Because of the combined weight of the upper-body gear, murmillones were usually the tallest, strongest gladiators, and they were rock stars—some may even have done product endorsements.</span>

                              <span>Since it was first announced in December 2012, the feature film adaptation of the wildly popular musical Wicked, itself an adaptation of the incredibly strange Gregory Maguire novel, has been beset by delays. First, there were eight years in development hell, easily enough to kill most films. Then there was a pandemic. Nearly a decade had passed since the initial announcement by the time Jon M. Chu took over as director in 2021, fresh off In The Heights and Crazy Rich Asians. By the end of the year, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande were cast as the green and pink protagonists, respectively. In April 2022, Chu posted a note sent from his “OzPhone” on Twitter that read, in part, “As we prepared the production over the last year, it became impossible to wrestle the story of &#x27;Wicked&#x27; into a single film without doing some real damage to it&quot;:
As we tried to cut songs or trim characters, those decisions began to feel like fatal compromises to the source material that has entertained us all for so many years. We decided to give ourselves a bigger canvas and make not just one &#x27;Wicked&#x27; movie but two! With more space, we can tell the story of &#x27;Wicked&#x27; as it was meant to be told while bringing even more depth and surprise to the journeys for these beloved characters.</span>

                              <span>The week before the election, for two nights in a row, I dreamt about the moon. The dreams were in sequence: two parts of a single story that were braided together. A single day of my life became the intermission. Everyone thinks their dreams are interesting. We are self-involved creatures, infatuated with the shiny pictures our subconscious makes for us and presents like a movie in the mere seconds before our brains return to the living. But the week before the election, my subconscious gave me something special. 
In the dream, the moon was shrinking. I was staring up at the sky while it swirled around and around, becoming smaller and smaller, orbiting around nothing, counterclockwise in an oval like it was going around a race track. And just when it became too small to really see, it became larger and larger and larger and larger. It was coming toward us, falling, plummeting into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. And then I woke up. The whole next day, I read about the moon. I researched what would happen if the moon fell (we would all die). I tried to understand how big the moon actually is (very big). Of course, it returned to my dreams the next night. In the sequel, the moon was lost. The moon had plummeted into the Pacific Ocean, and we could not find it. In the dream, I watched videos on my phone, desperate to try and understand what had happened here: videos from the ISS, of the news, or of crews searching the Pacific.</span>

                              <span>There are certain hard and fast facts to deal with. Christmas simply is when and where it is; Christmas season surrounds it in some more subjective but necessarily limited ways. Christmas season may begin for some people after Halloween, and for others after Thanksgiving, but it ends before the new year begins for everyone and cannot just begin whenever a person needs or wants it to. Anyway, this is what I would have told you before we had Defector&#x27;s own Sabrina Imbler on the podcast this week. Now I am not so sure.</span>

There are childhood memories that linger in your soul for no discernible reason, and here is one of mine. I was six years old. I was living in Chicago, and playing on a Mites-level youth hockey team. I have no memory of whether or not I was a good hockey player. This was the level of youth sports where you’re essentially dressing up as an athlete without being one yet. You put on your equipment, you skate onto the ice, you do what the coach tells you until you don’t feel like doing it anymore, and then you dick around like the kid you are. A slightly more organized playdate. I remember my skates being super tight, I remember being taught how to loosely stick handle the puck, and I remember my pads smelling like a cadaver after I’d taken them off. The rest is a haze.</span>
