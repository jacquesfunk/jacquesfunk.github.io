                              <span>Rarely does a labor fight facilitate such rich, obvious imagery, but the Park City strike provided: A disgusted Twitter user&#x27;s camera shows a cluster of skiers massing at the base of a lift, huddled in at a density instantly identifiable even to the non-skier as oversaturated; as the shot pans left, we see the lift is running parallel to the cameraperson, establishing that they are not even in that clogged main line, but in fact waiting to enter its maw; finally, the up-mountain angle shows they&#x27;re lucky to at least be in the front of this auxiliary line, as there are several dozen people behind them, spanning the length of cable between two support poles. Conditions, naturally, are incredible. All that new snow, and no way to get onto it.
It becomes very clear upon watching this clip or any of the others like it that Park City Mountain Resort cannot function without its ski patrol workers, and that the resort&#x27;s owner, Vail Resorts, views both its labor force and clientele with scorn and indifference. The ongoing strike in Park City is, like any labor dispute, a discrete fight between two parties over the permissible parameters of exploitation. But it is also a fracture, a break caused by the overwhelming pressure of extractivism&#x27;s ruthless logic applied past the breaking point of rationality. The long lines and the testimonies of strikebreaking skiers who had to get rescued by cut-rate scab ski patrollers are the clearest and most visually striking representations of what happens when a service-based industry is held hostage by capital until it can no longer operate as such.</span>

                              <span>Another former San Diego Wave employee has sued the NWSL and the Wave, bringing the number of former employees suing the club and the league for creating an abusive and hostile work environment to six. According to the amended complaint, the woman, who filed as Jane Doe 2, was working for the club when her supervisor began sexually harassing her, including sending her photos of his penis. She lost her job after she refused his advances, the suit said, and he stopped scheduling her for work.
Doe 2 joined five other former employees—all women—in suing the NWSL and the Wave in San Diego Superior Court. The lawsuit asserts more than a dozen civil claims, including disability discrimination, racial discrimination, sexual harassment, retaliation, wrongful termination, and retaliating for engaging in protected activity. Doe 2 is joining the others on six claims: sexual harassment, failure to investigate and prevent discrimination and harassment, retaliation, wrongful termination, negligent hiring, and negligence.</span>

On Jan. 1, two separate American-born veterans of the occupation of Afghanistan died while using a rented truck to commit a sensational act of violence in a highly visible place in a major tourist destination. Shamsud-Din Jabbar reportedly pledged his allegiance to ISIS, then drove through a New Year&#x27;s crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, killing 14 and wounding dozens more before the police killed him in a shootout. The FBI said that he had declared he wanted to call attention to the &quot;war between the believers and the disbelievers.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Last night&#x27;s Vikings–Lions game had been long anticipated as the perfect way to end the NFL&#x27;s often turgid regular season, in that it set two longtime rivals at the peak of their historical powers against each other in a game with real stakes. The winner would get the top seed in the upcoming playoffs, a week off and all its games at home, while the loser would be dropped to the fifth seed, a game every week and all with the likelihood that they would be played at the other team&#x27;s stadium, all because both teams were in the same division and only one could receive proper compensation while the other got a thumb in the eye. Reward for the victor, rules-based cruelty to the loser. What could be more deliciously unfair, or for that matter unfairly delicious?
And after all that, they had already played each other in a delightful game with plenty of scoring and tenseness that left everyone limp but satisfied that their lads had done their all. Sport at its most satisfying for all involved—this would surely be that again.</span>

                              <span>The Great East Coast Drone Panic seems to have abated, or at least gone into hibernation. It didn&#x27;t have staying power because, for whatever unexplained lights people believed they were seeing in the skies, every video posted of said lights was immediately and very easily explainable. Sir, that&#x27;s clearly jets lining up to land at an airport. Governor, that&#x27;s obviously Orion&#x27;s Belt. Darren Rovell, that&#x27;s the most airplane-looking airplane I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life. There may have been drones involved at some point, but the hysteria ballooned for the simple reason that, suddenly, people in one of the busiest airspaces in the world were paying attention to the night sky for the first time in their lives.
Rather than take the opportunity to mock, I think this could be a chance to educate. The night sky, even in populated, light-polluted areas, is full of interesting stuff. That stuff can be mysterious and even spooky if you don&#x27;t take the time to learn what it is you&#x27;re looking at. But once you do know—and there are apps that will tell you—the stuff becomes even cooler.</span>

I first became acquainted with Passmore&#x27;s work via the Bluesky account Old Fruit Pictures, which was built by Parker Higgins. The account draws on the thousands of paintings created between 1886 and 1942 for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In real We Used To Be A Country behavior, the USDA hired several artists full-time to document the plants found by USDA plant explorers. According to the USDA, there are almost 7,500 watercolor paintings in the collection.</span>

In 1184, Henry VI, King of Germany, of the royal house of Hohenstaufen, was marching to war in Poland, from his capital in Aachen. His path took him through Erfurt, the capital of Thuringia, which had been unsettled ever since Henry&#x27;s father, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, had deprived the recalcitrant but powerful duke, Henry the Lion, of many of his holdings. Scrambles to obtain those lands occurred in Saxony, Bavaria, and in Thuringia, where Archbishop Conrad and Landgrave Louis III were squabbling over Conrad&#x27;s construction of a new castle in a strategically valuable—to Louis, threatening—position. (You don&#x27;t need to remember any of these names.) With Henry passing through, it made sense for him to try to mediate the conflict.</span>

                              <span>Perhaps like their shooting percentage, the harmony and good vibes of the Vancouver Canucks were due for regression this year. Still clinging to the second Western Conference wild card spot but with a tough remaining schedule and a new batch of injuries, the Canucks are neither good enough to contend (as they were last year) nor bad enough to write off (as they were for several years before that). The on-ice product is such a slog that the only entertainment the team now provides is in the form of a purported rift between their two top centers, Elias Pettersson and J.T. Miller.
The simplest version of this story goes that Pettersson is passive and disengaged while Miller is intense and abrasive to the point of bullying, and because of this, they do not get along. “Petey and my relationship has come a long way. We&#x27;re still working at it. We&#x27;re completely different people, you know what I mean?” Miller told Sportsnet&#x27;s Iain MacIntyre last February. If you’re at all familiar with hockey media’s latent Don Cherry mindset, you can guess that they tend to read the Swedish Pettersson as aloof and effete, while J.T. Miller, who gets caught swearing on the on-ice microphone roughly 15 times a season, plays his foil, the classic American red-ass who cares a lot.</span>

                              <span>Unsatisfied that the Miami Heat didn&#x27;t get the hint the first or second times around, Jimmy Butler finally just said it on Thursday night: He wants a trade. The permanently aggrieved Heat forward has been especially aggrieved this season after the team didn&#x27;t offer him an extension on his big honking contract this past summer, so despite the Heat actually playing some decent basketball, he&#x27;s done with them.
The shape of this superstar trade demand mostly adheres to the standards of the form, but things could get weird in the month remaining between now and the trading deadline. These are the Miami Heat and Jimmy Butler we&#x27;re talking about here, two forces whose stubbornness is only matched by their performance of obstinance.</span>

                              <span>The South Eastern Conference has not had a good go of it in this year&#x27;s bowl season. The conference reached a low point during last night&#x27;s Sugar Bowl, in which Georgia was pantsed by Notre Dame. It was an odd thing, watching this Notre Dame team that lost to NIU cruise to a 23-10 victory while looking bigger and stronger than their SEC powerhouse opponents.
You can argue that Georgia played better than the score indicates, even while starting QB Gunner Stockton. Stockton was fine, throwing for 234 yards and one touchdown while outplaying his counterpart, Riley Leonard, who threw for just 90 yards a touchdown. The game was decided in the margins, with Georgia losing two fumbles at critical points and Notre Dame beginning the second half with a 98-yard kick return for a touchdown. Georgia was out-coached, out-schemed, and much of their season&#x27;s sloppiness finally came back to bite them. Maybe their rookie QB was a deficit, but I would ask anyone making that argument to go watch some Carson Beck tape from this year.</span>

                              <span>Who threw the glass in the street, man? That query has echoed in my head ever since I saw D.A. Pennebaker&#x27;s 1967 documentary Don&#x27;t Look Back, which captured in cinéma vérité the overwhelming attention that followed Bob Dylan to England in &#x27;65, while he was still a solo acoustic act on stage. The documentary crystallizes what is probably the most commonly shared cultural image we have of Dylan: a skinny dude with sunglasses and messy hair and disordered energy, speaking in snide riddles, beset by clueless questions from square reporters.

                              <span>It is a weird but entirely satisfactory anomaly of the first true college football national tournament that the seeding mattered exactly not at all. The lowest seed in the field is going to end up as a touchdown favorite over the highest seed remaining, three of the four semifinalists are big, name-brand schools that can be found less than 500 miles from each other, and every remaining team is a traditional powerhouse. 
In other words, in its first attempt at a proper tournament, this most baronial of sports got the only things it ever wants, which is an emphatic reinforcement of its regional roots (plus those outworlders from Austin) and the return of Notre Dame. The rest of you can piss right off.</span>
