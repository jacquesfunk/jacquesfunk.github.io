Casual viewers and movie buffs alike have favorite movies to watch at certain times of the year. But for film critic Abby Olcese, movies with spiritual themes aren’t just limited to the holiday season. As our Film Editor at The Pitch, we can attest to that firsthand.

                              <span>If you find yourself on FEMA&#x27;s website, odds are you are already in a worst-case scenario. No one thinks of the Federal Emergency Management Agency except when their house has been reduced to a pile of debris and all the roads leading in and out of your city have been washed off the map. Or, for instance, when you see something on TikTok about the government corralling people in Florida and preventing them from evacuating ahead of catastrophic hurricanes. FEMA works almost exclusively in natural disasters, so there is a bleak logic to devoting pages on its website to fact-check a growing list of hurricane-related conspiracy theories.
&quot;FEMA is not blockading people in Florida and preventing evacuations,&quot; one of the entries reads. &quot;FEMA does not control traffic flow or conduct traffic stops, which are handled by local authorities. This is a harmful rumor that can put lives in danger.&quot;</span>

                              <span>BROOKLYN, N.Y. — I chuckled when I saw the words printed on the giveaway T-shirts at Finals Game 2 in New York on Sunday afternoon: “NOT DONE YET.” A kinder reading goes that all contenders think like this, no matter their situation. In the shadow of a Game 1 win, those words might have projected a noble kind of focus. We won’t rest on our regular-season laurels. Job’s not finished. Eyes on the prize. Giveaway shirt production lead times are probably not such that the Liberty ordered thousands of these to cope, anyway. But the shirts took on a slightly grimmer, funnier meaning in light of what actually happened in Game 1: an awful New York collapse. Now, methought the shirt doth protest too much. The “Our Season Is Definitely Not Over” T-shirt had people asking a lot of questions already answered by the shirt.
In a technical sense, it was true, though. The Liberty were not done yet. They still had a split to salvage in New York. And their home crowd, if volume was any sign, loved them no less for their choking. Fans might have felt a sense of déjà vu as the Liberty went up 17 points early, gutted through the second and third quarters, and then let the Lynx make it a one-possession game late in the fourth. But Breanna Stewart, she said afterward, was determined not to let “history repeat itself.” A determined Stewart is an awesome sight, and her arms made possible an alternate ending. Minnesota tried running back the small lineup that had worked for them in Game 1, but Stewart reminded them why it had always been a risky idea. She timed jumps like a defensive back to grab Minnesota lobs out of the air; she hung low to wreck entry passes and dribbles. After Courtney Williams skated past Jonquel Jones to make it a 68-66 game with 3:40 left to play, the Liberty ended the game on a 12-0 run. Stewart would finish with eight rebounds and a Finals-record seven steals, three of them in the fourth quarter.</span>

The wind picks up. My heart quickens. I am in the middle of every rollerblader’s nightmare. All around, skaters skid and slow for fear of falling or colliding.
A few feet ahead of me, a far-too chipper man in a white helmet races up to a woman as she cautiously makes her way down the road, her legs shaking harder with every glide.</span>

The Greatest Show in Teal continued in London on Sunday and the Jaguars were decimated by the Bears to the tune of 35-16. Afterwards head coach Doug Pederson said his 1-5 team was on the verge of something. Greatness? Doom? 
&quot;We&#x27;re on a slippery slope, or right on the cusp of that slope,&quot; Pederson said. &quot;At some point we&#x27;ve got to [say] enough is enough, and you&#x27;ve got to have enough pride and figure out a way.&quot;</span>

                              <span>On Saturday, in three separate college football games, I saw a personal record three onside kicks recovered by the kicking team. Our once-beautiful and vibrant (OK, maybe it was never beautiful or vibrant) onside kick culture has suffered some real blows in the last year. The NFL effectively banned surprise onside kicks with its new kickoff rule, which allows onside kicks only in the fourth quarter and also requires the kicking team to declare they are onside kicking. But yesterday, these guys kept the culture alive. Let&#x27;s consider their onside kick strategies:

                              <span>The challenge of pitching is to stay unknowable—to keep hitters guessing, to never be timed up or figured out. By the end of the Tigers-Guardians American League Divisional Series, which featured a considerable number of relief innings even by the standards of postseason baseball, it did feel like these teams, who had met 13 times already in the regular season, were each becoming quite familiar with the other. The resulting sights could be something unfamiliar to fans: Detroit’s Beau Brieske, who hadn’t given up a home run off his fastball all season, serving up a go-ahead meatball to David Fry in Game 4; unhittable Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase allowing one less earned run in this series than he had all year. The threat of overexposure made each game feel extra tense. “It was such a fun series,” Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt said after Game 5 on Saturday, a 7-3 Guardians win. “Two very evenly matched teams going at it, and it was a lot of fun.” 
Though Cleveland’s path to the postseason wasn’t as bizarre as Detroit’s—the Guardians took first place in the division in mid-April and never relinquished it, despite scares from the Twins and Royals—they were both teams depending on run prevention. The Guardians offense cooled off in the second half, but the team stayed afloat thanks to an elite homegrown bullpen. An early-season injury to ace Shane Bieber, plus some underperformance from young arms, left the Guardians rotation in roughly the same [shrug emoji] shape as the Tigers’ heading into the postseason.</span>

In its aftermath, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a severe geomagnetic storm watch for Thursday and Friday. This storm could not only temporarily disrupt power and radio signals, but also trigger stellar spectacles across the world known as aurora borealis.
Last night, as I traversed the streets of Brooklyn, photographers worldwide turned their eyes to sky.</span>

                              <span>I bought the card in May of 2022. It was one of my many low-dollar purchases on eBay, made during one of my manic buying phrases; those tend to happen when I’m in a particularly good or particularly bad mood. “Stop buying things,” my wife will say when, say, a UK demo cassette of the song “Your Woman” by White Town arrives at the house. And I will reply, “But I’m in one of my manic buying phases when I am in a particularly good or particularly bad mood!” Eventually I toss the item in a box and forget about it, and then I try to remember to work on things in therapy and maybe ask for a medication tweak.
Anyway, this particular purchase was her fault for once. She was the one who told me about the card. Jan usually experiences sports vicariously through me, but she is a baseball fan. Our third date featured a long discussion about Bobby Estalella and whether he was the worst player named in the Mitchell Report. (Feel free to discuss in the comments.) So she knows a bit about sports cards. And one of the reasons we love each other so much is that she, like me, has a brain full of esoteric knowledge that could never, ever be useful in any scenario. Sometimes she tells me something wonderful and I just kiss her.</span>

                              <span>Standing in front of Sol LeWitt’s Wall Drawings, I felt my body go all fuzzy. My eyes followed the precise lines that crossed each other again and again, each on its own predetermined path but also existing as a component of the whole. Humble straight lines drawn in pencil or crayon, multiplied to such a dizzying degree that when you stand back, they blend together into a wiggling mass that comes into and out of focus like an optical illusion. I wanted to run my fingers over the lines; I imagined I would be able to feel the ridges they made in the wall, the way my handwriting does in my notebooks. 
It was the last day of summer, and I was visiting Mass MoCA for the first time with a group of my former coworkers. It’s been seven years since we all worked together, and in that time our relationships have cohered more into a family. There were 10 of us there that day, plus two babies, so once we started looking at the art, we broke up into groups based on our pace, interests, and whether we had a toddler to chase.</span>

                              <span>Major League Baseball has been broadcast regularly on television in North America for more than 70 years. By now, you figure it could be done pretty well. This is because humans tend to get better at things through repetition. You give me enough chances to learn and refine the doing of something, even something that involves wires and buttons and so forth, and I am going to be way better at the thing after a few decades at it. Recently I replaced my home&#x27;s wireless router, all by myself! From the accumulated experience of having occasionally replaced routers over the years, now you can just hand to me a router and, buddy, I am gonna install that sucker without dying.
Something weird seems to be happening with baseball broadcasts, however. Despite the basic requirements having changed roughly not at all over the course of most of a century—the game is still played on a diamond, you point a camera at it and press the &quot;on&quot; button, etc.—the people who produce baseball broadcasts are suddenly worse at the job. Not just in the sense of assigning the utterly joyless duo of Bob Costas and Ron Darling to the Royals-Yankees divisional series. That certainly sucked, yes, but something worse was happening in the other ALDS, between the Detroit Tigers and the Cleveland Guardians, also produced by TNT Sports (formerly Turner Sports). Here is the normal view of the action at a Tigers home game, taken from moments before the Tigers clinched their postseason berth, on Sept. 27:</span>
