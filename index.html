                              <span>The Royals officially released Hunter Renfroe yesterday, according to the MLB.com transaction log. This was the expected outcome after Kansas City designated the veteran outfielder for assignment last week. K.C.’s surprising two-year free agent investment in Renfroe did not work.

There is more than one kind of those, and while we were probably due for one of the loopy, pre-vacation, Oops! All Digressions episodes, there is a whole long summer ahead of us to fill with those, and still some really good playoff basketball happening. Between the fact of that dwindling season and Drew&#x27;s latter-day return to NBA fandom, the decision was decently easy. It&#x27;s a just-us episode, but this one is also About Sports.</span>

                              <span>Late in the second set of his matchup with French doubles specialist Pierre-Hugues Herbert, 18-year-old Brazilian player João Fonseca scored a point to even the tenth game of the set at 30–all. &quot;Scored&quot; is the most active verb I can use there, as the exchange only ended when Herbert dumped an unthreatening rally ball into the net. Yet Fonseca erupted into a celebration, conducting the crowd into a froth, asking for more energy, more pressure. It was like stepping to the free-throw line and cupping a hand to one&#x27;s ear for more noise.
Fonseca lost that game, though he won the set in a tiebreak, then took the third set, 6–4, to move on to the third round of the French Open. There is a lot to love about Fonseca, the ebullient princeling of men&#x27;s tennis. To me, the most striking thing about the Fonseca experience, more than the actual striking itself, is his relationship with pressure. He doesn&#x27;t shy from it; he courts it. He doesn&#x27;t wilt; he locks in. Fonseca demands attention, and he performs, displaying a magnetic brand of confidence in his equally magnetic game. I can&#x27;t look away.</span>

                              <span>Becca Beckham grew up around the South in a military family. Beckham&#x27;s family moved every two to four years, and she grew up, she says, with public service in her heart. &quot;The military really shaped my family, and I appreciate everything that it&#x27;s done,&quot; she said. &quot;But I knew in my heart that that is not the path that I wanted to take.&quot; 
Beckham always knew she wanted to experience more of the United States. In college, she became interested in the Peace Corps, and then AmeriCorps—the federal agency that organizes community service across the nation. &quot;It&#x27;s this vague, big thing that a lot of people have heard of, but they&#x27;re not necessarily sure what it does,&quot; Beckham said. AmeriCorps, envisioned as the national version of the Peace Corps, was created in 1993 under President Bill Clinton. The agency offers people opportunities to serve communities across the U.S., addressing needs such as education, disaster response, and public health. Beckham joined an AmeriCorps program that led a team of 10 people around the nation for a year, working on disaster relief efforts in Missouri, Colorado, Texas, Alabama, and New York.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;d say it had to be Carter Verhaeghe, and in fact it was, but to give him the full credit for yet another heartbreaking playoff goal would obscure the effort of Aleksander Barkov, who deserves the majority of the applause for the late game-winner in the Panthers&#x27; series clincher against the Hurricanes. Thanks to this pair, Florida is heading to the Stanley Cup Final for the third straight year. And they&#x27;ve made it this far looking just as tough, nasty, and talented—if not even more so.
Hurricanes fans couldn&#x27;t have had much hope after their team went down three games to none, but the next four periods of hockey might have shown them, briefly, a glimmer of light. There was the shutout win on Monday to start, and then on Wednesday, Sebastian Aho managed to beat Sergei Bobrovsky twice in the first period for a 2-0 lead. That early advantage wasn&#x27;t enough, though. Florida hit them with three goals in the middle of the second period, and after Seth Jarvis struck back to tie it for the home team in the third, Verhaeghe silenced the Carolina crowd for the summer.</span>

He was a man grappling with an expression, actively managing his mouth shapes and struggling to etch something delight-ish into the available margins. Perhaps you are thinking this is an artifact of botox. That is not your damn business! To me Breen&#x27;s face was succumbing in realtime not to the horrors of botulism but to the burden of forced hope…</span>

                              <span>The other day, bemoaning the state of his WNBA fantasy team bench, my colleague Jasper mentioned that he’d just picked up a player he’d never heard of: someone named &quot;K. Westbeld,&quot; with no photo. This was more or less how the real Phoenix Mercury conducted their offseason business. The team has not owned its first-round pick in five straight drafts. To construct the new “big three” of Kahleah Copper, Alyssa Thomas and Satou Sabally, Phoenix dealt away virtually every other rotation role player they had. Basketball teams tend to have more than three players on them. So began an offseason scrounge through the photoless. 
But don’t judge a player by her lack of photo! Two weeks into the WNBA season, the Mercury are one of the most fun teams to watch, in large part thanks to international scouting finds the average WNBA fan had not heard of before now. In Kathryn Westbeld—and fellow new signings Monique Akoa Makani, Kitija Laksa and Lexi Held—the Mercury have some real role-player gems. They defend, pass, shoot, and generally make good decisions. At home against the Sky on Tuesday, they led the team to a 94-89 win after trailing by 16 in the third. An incredible fourth quarter saw Laksa, Akoa Makani and Westbeld combine for six threes.</span>

                              <span>When the nervous peloton began their long, slow ascent up out of the Adda River valley to Bormio to finish Stage 17 of the Giro d&#x27;Italia, I thought Isaac Del Toro was cooked. The 21-year-old Mexican rider had put up an admirable fight for the first 16 stages of the Giro, and though he&#x27;d clung on to the maglia rosa leader&#x27;s jersey longer than anyone expected he&#x27;d be able to, third weeks of Grand Tours are unforgiving, especially for a young rider who has never faced the pressure of defending a leader&#x27;s jersey before. 
One day earlier, Del Toro cracked on the San Valentino, losing over 90 seconds to the hardened Richard Carapaz and the moderately hardened Simon Yates; one climb earlier, Carapaz and Yates made him quiver. It stood to reason that Del Toro&#x27;s infirmity would compound, and the veterans would do him the courtesy of easing the pain of carrying the jersey. Instead, he seized the initiative and smoked everyone to win his first Grand Tour stage in style.</span>

                              <span>Like brother Magary, I have been re-energized as a fan by this year’s NBA playoffs, although I do admit that watching Jayson Tatum take one of Paris’s arrows harshed my mellow considerably—classical allusion courtesy of the Society of Jesus, circa 1974. It  was partly un-harshed by the emergence of Luke Kornet, Force of Nature. But, otherwise, it has been a voyage of discovery. I knew Anthony Edwards because my friend Tom Crean had recruited him at Georgia, but Jaden McDaniels was a complete mystery to me. I couldn’t keep Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic straight for the longest time. Tyrese Haliburton might have been the lead singer for the Spinners for all I knew.
When did Shai Gilgeous-Alexander get this good?</span>

                              <span>Credit where credit is due: USA Today sports columnist Christine Brennan has tried very hard to establish herself as the nation&#x27;s foremost Caitlin Clark alarmist. Whenever something routine for a pro athlete happens to the Indiana Fever&#x27;s star, Brennan&#x27;s job is to turn it into a matter of existential concern for the WNBA, a league that has 12 other teams. This week&#x27;s news provided another opportunity. Crisis alert: Caitlin Clark has strained her quad. Can women&#x27;s basketball as a whole possibly soldier on?
The tone of Brennan&#x27;s latest column might mislead the reader into thinking that Caitlin Clark has died. In reality, the Fever guard is only sidelined for at least a couple of weeks; after Tuesday&#x27;s practice she was casually putting up three-pointers. In Brennan&#x27;s reality, this is a recession-level event for the WNBA:</span>

                              <span>Stuart Skinner offers little in the way of championship onomatopoeia, which is to say his name does not suggest athletic greatness. It suggests the secretary-treasurer of the chess club, or an unprepared con artist trying to spontaneously impersonate Tampa Bay Rays owner Stuart Sternberg.
But Skinner owns, for now, the Stanley Cup fate of the Edmonton Oilers, and by extension the possibility that a Canadian team might win it all for the first time since 1993. As the Oilers&#x27; goaltender he has defined both the glories and horrors of being an Oil fan, because there is never a guarantee of what level of quality he will provide.</span>

                              <span>Donald Trump released yet another deranged statement on Tuesday, demanding that a transgender high school student be barred from participating in the California state track and field championships, which are scheduled to be held this weekend in Clovis, Calif. The inane thoughts that make their way from Trump&#x27;s obviously diminished mind onto his Playskool social media platform should not demand the attention of any right-thinking Americans, and yet in this case the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) snapped to attention, rewriting its qualification rules in an attempt to appease those behind what&#x27;s become a national hate campaign directed at a 16-year-old high school student.
The student Trump was referring to in his post is named AB Hernandez. She is set to compete in the high jump, triple jump, and long jump at the state championships, and she has spent the past few months being harassed by a local group of bigots. This group is led by Sonja Shaw and Jessica Tapia, both members of the Save Girls Sports association. Shaw is currently running for California superintendent of public instruction, and Tapia was recently fired from her teaching position at Hernandez&#x27;s high school for refusing to respect trans and nonbinary students&#x27; pronouns. At a qualification meet earlier this month, Tapia and Shaw led a group that spent hours heckling and harassing Hernandez as she competed.</span>

This week, we’re off to a prestigious private school in the West Village, where our friend-of-a-friend Ellen will have to figure out how involved she wants to get in her daughter’s 8th-grade fundraising competition. Unfortunately, it seems like Ellen’s mom-nemesis, Hazel, has no intention of playing by the rules. Would it be moral to just let Hazel get away with that?</span>

                              <span>The pattern was: The New York Knicks would scramble the length of the floor in desperation—frantic, wide-eyed, bolts rattling loose, spotting passing and dribbling lanes just as they snapped shut—in search of a bucket. When they got one, it scanned most credibly as an accident. Then, whether the Knicks got one or not, the Indiana Pacers would breeze unimpeded the other way and Tyrese Haliburton would create a wide-open, high-value shot for himself or somebody else within seven seconds. That pattern leads where anybody would expect it to go. The Pacers won Game 4 of the Eastern conference final Tuesday night, 130–121, and now lead the series three games to one.
When the Pacers wasted any tightly distributed handful of the approximately infinite good looks they enjoyed on the night, the Knicks could hang around, aided by 39 free-throw attempts and an unaccountable second-quarter stretch in which they wiped away a 10-point deficit and took a one-point lead with Delon Wright on the floor and Jalen Brunson off it. (Wright found time to commit a double-dribble violation in there, and played a shade under two minutes in the second half.) But the Pacers never relented so long that they couldn&#x27;t just breeze back out to a multi-possession lead with 90 seconds of focus once they locked back in. Haliburton in particular delivered what&#x27;s probably, given the circumstances, the best game of his career so far: 32 points, 15 assists, 12 rebounds, four steals, and not a single turnover, despite doing the vast bulk of Indiana&#x27;s ball-handling and creating over his 38 minutes. Even as his shooting cooled off after a bonkers first quarter, he maintained Indiana&#x27;s lunatic pace, kept the buzzsaw whirring, and sectioned New York&#x27;s defense to toothpicks.</span>

                              <span>Let us approach Shohei Ohtani as naively as possible, while admitting that in the case of Ohtani this decision can hardly be anything but a ruse. For the span of time that he has been on the Los Angeles Dodgers, Ohtani has been a designated hitter, and a very good one: He won the MVP last year in spite of being a designated hitter, and this year has been, depending on how you count, either the second- or third-best offensive player in MLB. The best is Aaron Judge, who is doing Aaron Judge things; the other second- or third-best player is, naturally, Ohtani&#x27;s teammate Freddie Freeman; Ohtani currently has both of them, as well as every other player in MLB, beat on home run tally.
Here is what that looks like over the course of a long weekend. The Dodgers came into it in a bit of a mire: a four-game loss streak, followed by a three-game win streak, followed in turn by another loss. Then their designated hitter opened up the final game of their series against the New York Mets by doing this:</span>

                              <span>The Florida Panthers, as terrifying a hockey team as they are, have made a bit of a habit out of elongating their playoff series. Take their slow start in Toronto last round, or the three they lost while up 3-0 to the Oilers last Stanley Cup Final. In all likelihood, their shutout loss on Monday night will be just another snooze button. But after a trio of wins in the Eastern Conference Final where the Panthers used the Hurricanes like a bonfire does newspaper, the Canes earned at least one victory to hang their helmets on. If nothing else from this series goes Carolina&#x27;s way—and so far, it hasn&#x27;t—they&#x27;ll at least have the excellent stretch of hockey that eventually delivered the game-winner in Game 4.
This action was tense until a pair of empty-netters carried the Hurricanes to a 3-0 final. But Carolina did a spectacular job limiting the defending champions&#x27; chances on net. Keeping the ice tilted has been the team&#x27;s personal path to victory year after year, but against the fury, physicality, and plain old talent of Florida, the Canes shrunk into something unrecognizable as they lost three games by a combined score of 16-4. Here, however, the team out-efforted the Pants, particularly from the midpoint of the first period through a Carolina penalty late in the second. In that time, Florida produced absolutely nothing of note on offense and relied on Sergei Bobrovsky to be tidy in goal. At 0-0 with the clincher in sight, Florida might still have felt fairly comfortable, but it was Logan Stankoven who ensured that his Hurricanes&#x27; momentum would not go wasted.</span>

The whole thing is worth a watch, as all his pressers are, pregame, postgame or even off-day, but the last 10 seconds are killer, especially if you keep in mind that his team just lost a chance to clinch a trip to the Stanley Cup Final by playing a game he admitted he &quot;didn&#x27;t like.&quot;

                              <span>I went into Overcompensating knowing very little, except that it was a vehicle for comic Benito Skinner. I know Skinner, like most people know him, through his @bennydrama7 Instagram account. He started it while still a high school student in Ohio—seven was the number on his football jersey—but only began posting his celebrity impressions and campy sketches as a college student at Georgetown. I specifically know him for one of my favorite bits of satire ever. I cannot for the life of me find it anymore, and my description won&#x27;t do it justice, but it&#x27;s basically Skinner parodying the work of Brampton bard Rupi Kaur—no one calls her that; all you need to know is that she&#x27;s an extremely famous extremely terrible Instagram poet (example: “a man who cries – a gift”) who comes from a town near e…</span>

                              <span>At some point near the start of the fourth quarter of Game 4 of the Western Conference Final, in which the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 128-126, a thought occurred to me: These teams are playing too hard. It just didn&#x27;t seem possible that an NBA game could withstand that much sustained frenzy and focus from its participants. I had a vision of several players suddenly collapsing on the floor, all of their mental and physical energy spent. I saw the fans in the arena becoming nauseous, unable to safely metabolize the potency of the basketball that was unfolding before them. Adam Silver was going to rush the court and put a stop to everything. No, no, you can&#x27;t do this, he&#x27;d shout. You&#x27;re going to ruin the rest of the games.
Monday&#x27;s game was unquestionably the best we&#x27;ve had so far in these playoffs. That&#x27;s an achievement in and of itself, considering how inert this series felt after the first two games, in which the Thunder seemingly established themselves as several classes above their opponent. But Minnesota caught Oklahoma City with all sorts of haymakers in Game 3, winning that one by 42, and so they came into Game 4 at the very least convinced that they could stand and trade. What resulted from that belief meeting the Thunder&#x27;s resolve to avenge the embarrassment of Game 3 was a game that reached and stayed at the highest levels of intensity for 48 minutes.</span>

                              <span>If Natasha Cloud has stopped smiling at all since mid-March, she has done so only in the privacy of her own home. She beamed when she met Ellie the Elephant at Liberty training camp last month. She and Breanna Stewart laughed it up on Cloud’s Instagram stories during a recent team excursion to Yankee Stadium. After New York’s home opener against the Aces, the crowd cheered at the sight of Cloud’s happy face on the jumbotron; she finished with 22 points, six rebounds and nine assists.
And can you blame her for smiling through it all, in disbelief of her life? The trade that sent her from Phoenix to Connecticut in exchange for Alyssa Thomas this past February scrambled the 33-year-old point guard’s plans. “I just want to be in an organization that truly invests from top to bottom: facilities, team, location, all of that. I want to compete for championships,” she said after the trade, which definitely stood in the way of all that. But then came a second trade, the biggest glamor upgrade she could hope for. Shuffled from a middle-of-the-pack Mercury team to a tanking Sun team to the defending champion Liberty, Cloud was so over and so back in the span of two months.</span>

                              <span>Knockout-tournament soccer is the best soccer because of how it amplifies the sport&#x27;s essence. The magic of the game lies in the tension between unpredictability and mastery. On one foot, the game is so difficult, so low-scoring, and played over such a relatively short timespan, that in 90 minutes truly anyone can beat anyone. On the other, the best players and teams are so good at dictating the encounter&#x27;s terms and appearing in the match&#x27;s few critical moments with touches of brilliance, that the outcome is rescued from a randomness that might render it meaningless and becomes imbued with real significance. The knockout tournament heightens both sides of this tension. Teams that reach the final do so by proving their ability to conquer entropy, but they only achieve glory by winning one last game, where anything can happen.
On Saturday, Arsenal pulled off a monumental upset by defeating Barcelona in the Women&#x27;s Champions League final. While this doesn&#x27;t make the Gunners necessarily the best team, it does I think make them the perfect winners of the club game&#x27;s best competition.</span>

                              <span>As a general rule, you do not want to know what sportswriters are eating. Assume that it&#x27;s happening at strange times and in strange ways. Some of this is due to the specific pressures of the job; some of it is just because sportswriters are strange. Sportswriters, on balance, are probably not as strange about food as the people that talk about sports on TV—Jim Nantz orders his toast briquette style; Ian Eagle claims that he has never &quot;ingested&quot; a condiment; Michael Kay once said he had never tried coffee or soup, and didn&#x27;t eat an egg until he was 62 years old—but sportswriters do not get paid as much, either. Just know that there are a lot of finicky habits in this industry. (Not me, though. I am normal.)
In one sense, the strangest thing about the grocery run that New York Post baseball columnist Jon Heyman posted on Twitter on Thursday is that the order itself is not very strange at all. It&#x27;s the sort of stuff that a sportswriter might enjoy while writing about sports: a big container of blueberries, popcorn (unpopped), Diet Coke, and cashews. Surely Heyman has peers whose last grocery receipts are far more unsettling. But think about the items above, and how much you would pay for them at the store. Would it be nearly $50? Would you be so upset about how close it is to $50 that you post about it online?</span>

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump sat down for a public meeting with Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa. Perched on an armchair in the Oval Office, with the White House&#x27;s newly installed gold-tone decorations stuck to the mantlepiece behind him, Trump declared that Ramaphosa is &quot;a man certainly in some circles really respected, other circles a little bit less respected, like all of us.&quot;</span>

                              <span>The most embarrassing of athletic debates is over: As of midnight last night, camogie players are free to sport the bottoms of their choosing. 
At an emergency meeting of the Camogie Association held last night in Dublin to quell increasingly loud protests, delegates repealed an antiquated rule that prohibited players of the ancient Gaelic game from wearing shorts, as their male counterparts always could. The vote was one-sided: The Camogie Association said after the meeting that 98 percent of the delegates at its hastily called Croke Park summit voted to do away with the misogynistic mandate immediately.</span>

                              <span>There is a pleasing symmetry to the Mission: Impossible brand cycle: 30 years between the 1966 debut of the original CBS television series created by Bruce Geller to the 1996 cinematic reboot starring Tom Cruise, and again between that first film and what would appear to be the final installment of the franchise this summer with Mission: Impossible–The Final Reckoning. A childhood favorite of Cruise’s, the original show is, for anyone tempted to look back, a portal to an era of American television that was willing to be goofy. Still, Mission: Impossible was always a heist series at heart. Inspired by the 1964 film Topkapi, which features a team of thieves attempting to steal from the titular palace of Sultan Mahmud I, Mission: Impossible the show melded the heist plot with obligatory espionage elements at a time when James Bond and Get Smart followed similar trends. 
By now, almost no one thinks of the television series, so wholly has the film franchise and its zealous lead actor taken over the past three decades, weathering seachange after seachange in the already turbulent, risky landscape of Hollywood. Behind it all, of course, is Cruise himself, who began Mission: Impossible as the first project for the now-defunct Cruise/Wagner Productions.</span>

                              <span>On April 7, the New Yorker and Time ran nearly identical stories that might be better described as press releases for the de-extinction company Colossal Biosciences. The two stories differed slightly: the New Yorker&#x27;s headline proclaimed &quot;The Dire Wolf Is Back,&quot; whereas Time&#x27;s announced &quot;The Return of the Dire Wolf.&quot; While the New Yorker led with a photo of a cub, Time led with a photo of a fully grown wolf. But the effect of these stories was the same, both creating the impression that the dire wolf is indeed back after 10,000 years of extinction.
What these stories seemed less interested in was the fact that the dire wolf was, in fact, not at all back, nor will it return anytime soon. Colossal is a company that runs on PR stunts, and the latest hoopla instigated a wave of criticism from scientists seeking to set the record straight: The &quot;dire wolf&quot; on the cover of these glossy magazines was not a dire wolf, meaning an individual of the extinct canine species Aenocyon dirus. Instead, the &quot;dire wolf&quot; was a modern wolf with 20 genetic edits, none of which involved the splicing of actual dire wolf DNA. &quot;It’s not a dire wolf. It’s misleading to call it that,&quot; Vincent Lynch, an evolutionary biologist at the University at Buffalo, told Chemical and Engineering News. “I can&#x27;t explain how pissed off it made me, because they&#x27;re still saying this stuff, and they know it to not be true.”</span>

                              <span>It can be hard to tell when it is safe to officially declare a bad baseball team a historically bad one. You usually kind of know it when you see it, but passing certain mile markers allows you to affirmatively point the finger and declare: These men belong in the piss pot of history.
One such signpost arrives when words like &quot;worst&quot; and &quot;since&quot; start popping up alongside years that start with 18. The Colorado Rockies hit that point on Thursday night, after losing 2-0 to the Philadelphia Phillies to push their season record to 8-42. The Rockies are now sole owners of the worst 50-game start in baseball&#x27;s modern era. You have to go all the way back to the 1895 Louisville Colonels, who started 7-43, to find a team that performed worse through its first 50 games. This team is squarely on the path trodden by the 2024 White Sox, who spent a good chunk of that campaign threatening to break the 1899 Cleveland Spiders&#x27; record for most losses in a season (134), but ultimately had to settle for the modern-era record (121). The Rockies are currently on pace to blow past the White Sox and pip the Spiders with 136 losses.</span>

                              <span>There are two main reasons for Philadelphia Eagles fans to hate Jeffrey Lurie: He’s a billionaire, and he owns the Eagles. Under Lurie, who bought the team in 1994 from car dealership magnate Norman Braman, the Eagles have been one of the best and best-run teams in the NFL.
Whatever. It does not matter that the Eagles have won two Super Bowls in eight seasons. It does not matter that the previous owner charged players for their own socks and pads, or that the owner before that tried to sneak the team out of town. Lurie is a Philadelphia sports team owner. You should hate him! Every Philly sports fan thinks they could do a better job owning the teams they hate and care about than the people that currently own them. I myself have so many ideas. The Eagles would win eight Super Bowls in eight seasons under my ownership. I will not give any of them away here to preserve my advantage.</span>

                              <span>When Paul Maurice was hired out of retirement to heal the Florida Panthers&#x27; multitude of competitive leprosies, he was called in some corners &quot;the enemy of fun.&quot; This happened because of the way he likes to play—simple, direct, minimizing open-ice flair, and emphasizing all things heavy. He is not a brutish tactician, but he recognized, without ever having the CV to prove it, that winning in April, May, and June requires a devotion to power, persistence, and crowd control in front of the net that hockey’s regular season dilettantes never seem to fully grasp.
But, and we&#x27;re being fair here, Paul Maurice is indeed also the enemy of fun. We can say this because the Panthers&#x27; Eastern Conference Final series against the Carolina Hurricanes is already deeply and profoundly un-fun, in the classic only-one-team-is-getting-its-way way. Beating the &#x27;Canes on Thursday night by the frankly rude score of 5-0 was lopsided enough, but other than an offside call that negated Carolina&#x27;s only real chance of the night, that score was actually a kindness. Put another way, through the first 40 minutes, the only two differences between the &#x27;Canes and Angel Reese were a) there were 17 more of them than her, and b) she got off more shots.</span>

                              <span>It seems safe to say, at this point, that the retrospectively rather quaint debate over whether Trumpism, as a political movement and a politics in itself, could or should be described as &quot;fascist&quot; has been settled. The bad news is in how we got to that answer, and in the bad news that every day brings. And with that colossally dispiriting answer come a whole bunch of new questions about what is to be done, and where we actually are, and how to get from here to the other side of things. This week, we were joined by Jason Steinhauer, the historian behind the History Club newsletter and the bestseller History, Disrupted, to discuss those questions, and the historical and cultural forces that created them, and to start working toward some answers. Also, hilariously, we discussed the NBA playoffs at the end.</span>

                              <span>Celebrities are human beings, sure, but they don&#x27;t move through life like the rest of us do. They will feel sadness and pain and disappointment many times during their years on Earth, just like you and I, but unlike you and I they will maintain access to all the blessings that money and talent and beauty bring them. For the most part, we only ever get to see them in the latter state, and it&#x27;s easy to conclude that all that good stuff they have makes their lives invariably better than ours on a day-to-day basis.
Sports can be an equalizer in this regard. Think about how bad the days after your worst moments as a sports fan felt. Every time my favorite team gets eliminated from the playoffs, I end up going through the next day in a sickly daze, feeling much like I did the morning after the 2016 election. This is not rational, but it is what being a sports fan does to my brain. Now imagine how much more intense that awful feeling is hitting Knicks fans today, hours after they witnessed their team cough up a playoff game in unthinkable fashion.</span>

                              <span>Hockey&#x27;s longstanding fetish for self-effacement got its best material reward in years on Wednesday night, thanks to an amazing comeback win that was at best fifth on the list of anyone’s notice, and that includes you finally doing your laundry. The Dallas Stars parlayed a well-earned 3-1 deficit through two periods of Game 1 of the Western Conference Final into a hilarious 6-3 victory over the much better regarded Edmonton Oilers, and what do they get as the new day dawns?
Crickets in a coma, that&#x27;s what they get.</span>

Currently, New York State prisoners serving time for violent offenses can earn up to 15 percent of good time. Under the new law, we will be able to earn up to 50 percent of good time, along with an additional 25 percent of &quot;merit time&quot; for those who obtain a college degree or complete other volunteer programs, such as providing long-term tutoring for pri…</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know what I expected from a European final between the 16th- and 17th-placed teams in the Premier League, but it wasn&#x27;t that. Maybe I was fooled by the stature of Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United as two of the biggest clubs in England, or maybe I figured that a final would bring out the best of two sides just crawling through a doomed domestic season in hopes that summer cures all ills. Instead, the 2025 Europa League final was ass. Butt. Garbage. Nevertheless, at the end of 90 painful minutes, there was a light at the end of this sewage pipe of a match: For the first time since 2008, Tottenham won a trophy.

                              <span>The Colorado Rockies are 8-41. Wednesday night’s 9-5 loss to the Phillies was their fourth in a row. Their .163 winning percentage is the worst in baseball. They have scored 164 runs and allowed 321. No one on the team’s hitting over .288; Ryan Feltner is the only starter with an ERA under 5.00. They are really bad.
This naturally makes it hard for in-house media to find anything positive to say about the team. By going out there every day and Being The Rockies, the worst team in the sport seems to have broken the brains of its PR team.

                              <span>In Sigrid Nunez’s 2018 novel The Friend, a famous writer kills himself. Not long before, he complains to the narrator about readers: “People talking about a book as if it were just another thing, like a dish, or a product like an electronic device or a pair of shoes, to be rated for customer satisfaction—that was just the goddamn trouble.” Students submit papers that say, “I hate Joyce, he’s so full of himself.” Online reviewers imply, “if a book didn’t affirm what the reader already felt—what they could identify with, what they could relate to—the author had no business writing the book at all.” The famous author quits teaching, quits writing. The state of the novel, its place in the world, is too depressing.
“But hasn’t it always been this way?” asks the narrator.</span>

                              <span>I made a fateful decision ahead of the Eastern Conference Finals. I think it was Sunday. The night before, the New York Knicks had finished off the defending champion Boston Celtics. The Indiana Pacers were already waiting around, having thrashed the East&#x27;s top seed in five games. It took me into Sunday to go huh, Pacers-Knicks. Do I care about that? I considered this deeply, the way one might ponder a puppy in a pet-shop window. Am I prepared to give my heart to this stupid thing? I decided, yes, I would buy the puppy. I activated the button inside my brain that allows for a feeling of cheesedness to adhere to a matchup between these two specific franchises, in a conference final, in 2025.
You see, I am old enough to remember a little thing we used to call the 1990s. The Knicks and Pacers were good teams then, back when making the playoffs used to mean something. There was a stretch, starting in 1993, when these two teams eliminated each other six times in eight years. Do not look up how many titles they combined to win over this period! The point is that a great deal of animosity built up between them, and many goofy narratives blossomed from the rivalry, and the whole era kicked ass. These teams played to Game 7s in 1994 and 1995 (and again last year), and met in consecutive conference finals in 1999 and 2000. Reggie Miller became a folk hero; guys like Dale Davis, Charles Smith, and Travis Best were pressed temporarily but firmly into mainstream basketball discourse. John Starks brushed perilously close to bozodom. Yes, I am now openly pandering to readers of my generation, but such is my prerogative. Basketball was aesthetically better in 1997! No one can stop me! Ha ha!</span>

                              <span>Tuesday’s Mets-Red Sox game marked a return to action for both Red Sox starter Walker Buehler and manager Alex Cora. Buehler was put on the IL with a shoulder injury on May 2; the inflammation cleared up fast enough that he was activated Tuesday morning without any rehab assignment. Cora’s absence was even briefer: To the ire of one Boston talk radio guy, Cora missed Monday’s game to attend his daughter’s college graduation.
“It’s not like they need him there to make the pitching change or lay down the bunt. It’s the leadership and optics of the whole thing,” 98.5 The Sports Hub host Michael Felger said. I can understand being hard up for story ideas; a Boston radio host probably didn’t think he’d have to talk baseball in late May.</span>

                              <span>Ten NFL teams voted against banning the Tush Push today, leaving the Philadelphia Eagles free to convert short-yardage plays at will. Somewhere inside of a Tilted Kilt, a freshly extended Nick Sirianni busts out his finest shit-eating grin in exultation.
As befitting the play itself, the Eagles had to grind this one out. The Tush Push was in grave danger of being outlawed two months ago when the Green Bay Packers had seemingly amassed a quorum of votes (24 were needed) to get their No Butt Stuff proposal approved at the NFL owners meetings. At the time, Packers coach Matt LaFleur derided the Tush Push as being too “rugby”-ish to belong in football (American football has its origins in rugby). The organization also considered the play a safety risk (competition committee chairman Rich McKay said there was no statistical evidence that the play is more dangerous than any other) and caused “pace of play” issues (uh, OK). No sane person bought any of those arguments. Whether the Packers were acting on their own behalf or at the nudging of commissioner Roger Goodell, who is rumored to abhor the Tush Push, the intent was always transparent: We can’t keep letting the Eagles get away with this. Given what I know about the Eagles and their fans, that’s normally a sentiment I’m down with. But not this time.</span>

                              <span>Nobody takes a hint less well than Rich Hill, and conversely nobody proves prevailing wisdom wrong more often than Rich Hill. With this in mind, we can again say one of the best-loved and certainly most frequently repeated sentences in contemporary baseball: Rich Hill is BACK!
His generic name aside, Rich Hill has been eased out of more throwing-related major league jobs than anyone this side of Josh Johnson, though in fairness this is Hill’s 24th year in professional baseball, and he is 45 years old. But when he signed a minor league deal with the injury-ravaged Kansas City Royals, it just felt right. When he pitched his first game for the Royals&#x27; Arizona Complex League team yesterday against the Chicago Cubs&#x27; representatives, it went swimmingly—four innings, 12 hitters, 12 outs, seven strikeouts. There is more work to be done, but go ahead and say it: Rich Hill is totally BACK!</span>

                              <span>The saddest stories in local news are the ones where the body has been left to sit for a while. I worked in local news for the first decade of my journalism career, and that often meant writing about people who died. Sometimes people died after a long and glorious life; all too often, they died far too young, and in easily avoidable tragedies. But every now and then a news release would come across my desk from local law enforcement asking for help identifying a body that they had found, and along with it a slew of horrible questions: How long had this person been dead? Did anyone notice they were gone? Death comes for all of us, but not all deaths are equal. Some are more cruel than others.
I remembered that feeling Tuesday, when news broke that the Chicago Sun-Times and The Philadelphia Inquirer had both published a special section—HEAT INDEX Your Best of Summer Guide—whose recommended summer reading list included a bunch of made-up books by real authors, the names and titles thrown together seemingly at random. It got worse from there. When reporters from 404 Media and later The Atlantic contacted the person who wrote the summer book list, he explained that he wrote it—or, anyway, put it together—using ChatGPT, and then had just forgotten to double check the work before submitting it to the company that had commissioned it, King Features, a division of newspaper publisher Hearst. The words, seemingly still unread by anyone who&#x27;d notice or care that they were mostly nonsense, then got shoveled along. Hearst packaged the words, then licensed the section to various newspapers, which duly printed it out and included it in their Sunday editions. If anyone did notice the many mistakes along the way, they sure didn&#x27;t stop them. No surprise, a lot of writers and readers got very mad about this online.</span>

                              <span>Spike Lee didn&#x27;t invent the floating dolly shot, but he did make it his signature move. It&#x27;s not just in his repeated use of the technique, but rather in his understanding of its storytelling potential. In Mo&#x27; Better Blues, the dolly shot captured Bleek&#x27;s obsession with his trumpet and how it mirrored the devotion he brought to sex with his two girlfriends. In Clockers, the dolly showed how Strike&#x27;s lifestyle of selling drugs, running from the cops, and being accused of a murder was destroying him both physically and mentally. In 25th Hour, the dolly captured both Mary&#x27;s drunken euphoria as a young woman at a party as well as Jacob&#x27;s out-of-body experience after abdicating responsibility for a moment. Spike uses the dolly to help him imbue his characters with depth, psychology, and conflict without uttering a word. In other hands, the dolly is often deployed at significant moments, or sometimes at seemingly mundane ones just to add some visual flair. Rarely does a Spike joint use the dolly as the definitive moment of his work. In fact, as far as I can remember there is only one Spike Lee movie in which the entirety of the film builds up to one particular dolly shot.

                              <span>One of my friends loves to say “buy the ticket, take the ride”—usually referencing the giant smothering cloud of apprehension and nausea that hits before the good part of the shroom trip (not that I’d know anything about that). But I feel as though this is a lesson that people who do it for the plot need to learn. If you take a bold stance or make a grand gesture, that’s an invitation to the world to match your freak. 
I can get behind the decision to have a sweet little date night with someone you just met while traveling abroad. I feel like there’s a Linklaterian mutual romanticization that can happen easily under those circumstances, and you can part ways feeling proud of your adventuresome spirit. But my sympathy ends there. When you decide to set up a surprise breakfast picnic for your date the next day, complete with soft cheese and flowers, you are buying a ticket. And today, dear listeners, you are in for a ride.</span>

I&#x27;m never good at determining in advance if a museum is the kind you spend one hour at or a whole day inside, so I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of Rochester&#x27;s collection—an absorbing first floor of American art (including Nick Cave&#x27;s ornithophilic &quot;End Upheld&quot;) and a beautiful second floor of historical international pieces with a baroque Italian organ at the center.</span>

                              <span>The rule is simple and straightforward, and it rarely proves anything but true: Judgments made after Game 1 of any series will tend to return to embarrass the impulsive jurist who made them. Still, both in Oklahoma City and Raleigh last night, we learned one distinct commonality between the Thunder and Florida Panthers. While playing entirely different sports in different locations, they maintain the same general philosophical approach, which is to make your experience as an opponent so unpleasant that their experience as a combatant comes to be defined by yours as the supplicant.
In other words, they win by making you miserable. If they happen to elevate the art of their respective games along the way, well, that would be a happy but entirely unintended consequence of the main task. Their joy is in your frustration. Their satisfaction is derived from your impotence. The worse it gets, the better.</span>

                              <span>There was a sequence in the first quarter of Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals where the Oklahoma City Thunder used a drive-and-kick and a swing pass to get the ball to versatile young noodleman Chet Holmgren, who&#x27;d floated to a whiteboard-perfect shooting position out above the break. Naz Reid of the visiting Timberwolves hastened to close out on Holmgren, who is a danger from deep. Holmgren showed a decent enough pump-fake to cause Reid to overcommit, and then darted to his right for a straight-line drive to the cup. Chasing a ball-handler from 27 feet is a tall ask for a big man, and here Reid was cleanly beaten. Holmgren&#x27;s handles are certainly adequate to this task, and anyway all he needs is one dribble to get from the arc to a controlled one-foot gather. The last man back was Donte DiVincenzo, and DiVincenzo was late. This looked like a dunk.
Reid is quicker than Holmgren, and his movement patterns are more recognizably humanoid, so he was never far from the play. As Holmgren gathered for take-off, Reid sprinted on an intercepting path and used his chest to deflect Holmgren off of the runway. The impact slowed Holmgren&#x27;s momentum—Holmgren still has the physique of someone who needs to speed-eat 100,000 beef sandwiches—which allowed Reid to make a reasonably controlled contest of what became a stalled, off-balance layup. The ball rimmed out, the Timberwolves gathered the defensive rebound, and the action flowed the other way.</span>
