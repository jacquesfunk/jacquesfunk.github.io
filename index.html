He was a walking enigma: an artist’s artist who was also somehow mainstream, an unapologetic esotericist whose work still managed to be immediately though ineffably understood, a well-known and highly regarded director who was nevertheless completely underrated. He’s arguably the most influential filmmaker of the last 50 years, and though many have tried, no one has been able to walk down the lane he invented with 1977&#x27;s Eraserhead.
Lynch died on Thursday at the age of 78. He had recently been suffering from emphysema due to complications from COVID, which kept him homebound. It&#x27;s another blow for Los Angeles in a grim month, since, along with being one of our great filmmakers, he was one of those luminary chroniclers of LA, on par with Joan Didion, Mike Davis, John Singleton, and Tupac. From his trilogy of LA films (Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, and Inland Empire), to his WKCR weather reports, to the apocryphal stories of his daily Bob’s Big Boy routine, and stunts like his FYC Oscar campaign for Laura Dern, he was a rich LA character, without whom the city seems that much dimmer.</span>

                              <span>Halfway through the first quarter of Oklahoma City&#x27;s blowout revenge win over the Cavaliers on Thursday, Max Strus hit a corner three to give Cleveland a two-point lead. That bucket would turn out to be quite a lonely one. The Thunder immediately ripped off a 30-2 run, a rugged sequence that highlighted the qualities that make them so great on both sides of the ball. 
Consider that Oklahoma City lost the first game between these teams in large part because of the opponent&#x27;s dominant duo of bigs, came into this one even smaller thanks to Isaiah Hartenstein&#x27;s injury, and yet ran away with the win. The Thunder&#x27;s lack of size, rather than dooming them, forced them to play compounded Thunderball and in the process showed what makes them special. Watch them work, and you&#x27;ll see a coherent philosophy unifying the ways they operate on both offense and defense, one built around the drive. It is a philosophy of pressure.</span>

Benjamin Mullin of The New York Times reported Thursday, for example, that Post management recently introduced a new motto to motivate the staff, &quot;Riveting Storytelling for All of America,&quot; and have set a goal to attract &quot;200 million paying users&quot; to the paper&#x27;s website. The slogan is dumb, and the number is dumber: The paper’s current subscriber count is reportedly around 3 million, and by all accounts plummeting. Not only is 200 million never happening, whoever suggested it should be fired.</span>

                              <span>America has now gotten all the Cleveland Cavaliers-Oklahoma City Thunder basketball we will be allowed before June, which is both not enough and more than enough to say with some confidence that these are the two most compelling teams in the National Basketball Thing by a healthy margin. Their two games were stay-in-your-chair fascinating, even Thursday night&#x27;s blowout &#x27;Der win, which followed a game eight days earlier in which the Cavs out-delivered OKC. A case can be made that their matchup is the only one that can save a season of ratings regret and regression, and it raises the same questions that were being asked a decade ago:
Can the NBA thrive with a championship series with two non-marquee teams? More to the point, a bunch of non-marquee players? And finally, why does that matter?</span>

“Well, it’s been a good run, my loves. 1.7 million followers. I don’t think I’m going to be able to replicate that anywhere,” KC Davis said in one video. Davis is a licensed therapist who gained her following by making videos showing people how to clean their homes when they were struggling with their mental health. “I know that I’m talented, but that was a combination of timing and luck and being the algorithm darling for about seven months in 2020,” she said. Davis has a new book coming out in May, but she’s uncertain how well the book will fare in the spring if TikTok goes dark in the U.S. within the next week.</span>

                              <span>During the first week of the fires, I would go up to my building&#x27;s roof once a day. I&#x27;d look at the Los Angeles skyline at whatever shade of yellow-orange-brown muck the fires had delivered that day and take a photo, and then I&#x27;d scurry back inside. Against my better judgment, one time I took my mask off for one second and immediately felt ill. The entire city smelled like a funeral pyre.
Back inside, I would turn on my TV, switch it to a local news station, and leave it on all day. I wouldn&#x27;t shut it off until a few hours before bed, when my husband and I would watch some scripted TV to unwind—unless the flames were getting a little too close, which only happened once. Local TV news and its updates became the soundtrack of my days, complete with its bright graphics, specific music, and the parade of weary-but-pulling-through-it anchors tossing to extremely awake but often harried live reporters. It was from local TV where I learned where to donate supplies for those who lost everything in the fires. It was on local TV that I—and many Angelenos—learned about a fire in the Hollywood Hills, later dubbed the Sunset Fire, that sparked up Wednesday night and required immediate evacuations in the heart of Hollywood. And it was on local TV where I first heard the stories of the people who died.</span>

                              <span>It was a sequence that perfectly captured the Pittsburgh Steelers’ desultory first-round playoff loss to the Baltimore Ravens on Saturday night, and also the desultory, mediocre reality that has surrounded the Steelers for a decade now. It happened early in the second quarter, with the Ravens leading 7-0 and the Steelers facing a third-and-2 from their own 28. Russell Wilson flipped a pass toward the right flat to tight end Pat Freiermuth. Just after the 6-foot-5, 258-pound Freiermuth caught the ball, Ravens safety Ar’Darius Washington—who stands all of 5-8, 180—came smashing into him. Washington proved to be no fly on Freiermuth’s windshield. He quickly brought Freiermuth to the ground just short of the sticks.
Rather than risk failure on fourth-and-1, Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin decided to punt. It goes without saying that this was cowardice, even though it was the Steelers’ inability to gain one yard on back-to-back plays that contributed to the previous week’s loss to the Bengals. ”We have to be able to make routine plays routinely,” Tomlin would later say.</span>

                              <span>This week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would ban trans girls and women from every level of sport, in every state in America. The text of the cynically titled “Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act” is as vague and confused as the roughly 25 state laws that already ban trans kids from sports, but it remains striking for its scope. This bill applies not just to college-aged athletes, but also to kids as young as kindergarten.
Supporters of the legislation really, really want you to believe this is all about fairness. It’s in the name of the bill: Banning trans women would protect cis women athletes (somehow). In affirming his support, the California Congressman Doug LaMalfa expressed outrage at the idea that “XY chromosome males” were currently “taking the place of women and girls in sports,” an analysis of the current situation that is just as darkly conspiratorial as it is bogus.</span>

                              <span>Last week, I went to Las Vegas to see the future, but mostly to podcast. I was there on assignment for Ed Zitron, host of the Better Offline podcast, and talked with him on several episodes of that pod about what I saw at the Consumer Electronics Show, which I found to be a strange and oddly dispiriting event. I wouldn&#x27;t say I saw the future there so much as I saw the present lengthening into incomprehensibility in high resolution, one AI assist at a time. This week, Drew and I had Ed on to talk about what we saw there, and what tech&#x27;s future might look like—after we talked about the NFL for half the podcast.</span>

                              <span>On Wednesday night, with a little more than two minutes left to play between the Memphis Grizzlies and San Antonio Spurs and the Grizzlies leading by 11, Ja Morant turned down a Desmond Bane screen, drove left, saw Victor Wembanyama rotating over from the far corner, and authored the highlight of the NBA season. Wemby, both gangly hands extended skyward, could only watch as Morant cocked back and dunked it right in his face. 
Morant strutted past the basket toward the crowd with his chest puffed out, knowing nobody on the planet, let alone in the arena, could say shit to him, for he&#x27;d just conquered the supposedly unconquerable. Wembanyama himself held his arms to the sky, as if to say Even if I got smoked, I made the correct play. Both players are in the right.</span>

One strange, if not fatal, aspect of the digital economy is that people who run any online business come to believe that they can run a business of any sort. Take Alex Mather, who co-founded The Athletic eight years ago with the mission to destroy all local newspapers. Mather succeeded in his objective (yay), and then sold his enterprise to The New York Times for a mint. Having crossed that off of his to-do list, Mather has decided he’s now qualified to head up the effort to conquer an even greater foe than a dying print media: Death itself.</span>

                              <span>It is not difficult to find people who loved Bob Uecker unreservedly. There is a good reason for this: He was the last genuinely and instinctively funny person in baseball history. He was the god of Milwaukee even if you include all the Green Bay Packers going back to before Vince Lombardi. He was the face and voice of baseball cinema, the man whose line-reading made &quot;Ju-u-u-u-st a bit outside&quot; so good that &quot;iconic&quot; doesn&#x27;t remotely cover its impact. Even if you&#x27;re not a seamhead, you likely came across Bob Uecker and smiled.
So Thursday&#x27;s announcement that Uecker has died at age 90, due to small cell lung cancer, came as a blow. Nine decades is a good long run, but there was never a sense that he was running out of material; Uecker was still a joy to hear on Brewers broadcasts even in Year 54 of being the voice of Wisconsin baseball for two-and-a-half generations. The reaction to his passing was unanimous in the same ways and for the same reasons that the response to Vin Scully’s death was unanimous—it was an outpouring of both sadness at the loss and gratitude for all the time we got to spend with him. In an epochally angry time in America, at a moment when it isn&#x27;t hard to find even anti-puppy polemics with a keystroke, Uecker gets a pass from most everyone. Yes he defined baseball, but he also managed to become more than merely Mister Baseball. From the moment of his first appearance on Johnny Carson&#x27;s definitive version of the Tonight Show, which Uecker earned merely by mastering the tripartite arts of comedy writing, unabashed self-deprecation, and martini-dry humor, he was recognizable as that rarest of Americans, the guy you&#x27;d sit back down to listen to even if you were already halfway out the door. Put another way, Norm Macdonald thought he was one of the funniest men he ever met. Beat that with a stick.</span>

                              <span>STOCKHOLM — Entering the final team fight of the Overwatch World Championship Series (OWCS) Grand Final, about 1,700 pairs of eyes in a Stockholm convention center scanned the two massive screens on either side of the main stage to see what ultimate abilities were available to the two teams, Crazy Raccoon and Team Falcons, arch-rivals based in Korea. Crazy Raccoon needed to win the fight to extend the match and their tank player, Junbin, had a play to make. Playing as the hero Mauga, he prepared to use the Cage Fight ultimate ability, one of the most powerful abilities in the game. 
But as the fight broke out between the two teams, Team Falcons&#x27; support player, Fielder, playing Brigitte, was closely tracking Junbin&#x27;s movements. When Junbin hit the Q button on his keyboard, initiating his ultimate ability, Fielder was left with just milliseconds to intervene. He rushed in and fired off a perfectly timed shield bash, stunning Junbin&#x27;s character and cancelling the ultimate before the on-screen animation could complete. Overwatch matches, particularly those played at a high level, are often won and lost between pixels, and in this case Fielder&#x27;s reflexes made Team Falcons world champions.</span>

                              <span>Given that the Los Angeles fires are still active, and given furthermore that the destruction they have wrought seems to be nearly area-wide, the idea of a basketball game worth watching in Los Angeles right now seems almost preposterous; whether such a game would be worth playing at all is its own debate.
Thus, we view Wednesday night&#x27;s Nets-Clippers game at the Intuit Dome—the Clippers&#x27; new and lavishly toileted home, a building that has generated no discernible buzz even from the moment it opened in October—with little of the wonder or delight one can usually derive from a game in which one team is fully staffed and the other is barely at half strength. Which was, in this case, also one in which the home team had a full day&#x27;s rest and was playing at home and the other had played the night before 1,100 miles away. I mean, what could the end result possibly be? Well, you guessed wrong. It was miles worse than that.</span>

                              <span>Neither I nor the Sabres attempted a shot on goal during the third period of Buffalo&#x27;s game against the Hurricanes Wednesday night. We&#x27;re so alike in many respects. However, despite going shotless over the 20 minutes, the Sabres scored an insurance goal to put away the Canes and complete Ryan McLeod&#x27;s first career hat trick, whereas I accomplished none of those things. Some entities have all the luck.
The stinky Sabres jumped out to a three-goal lead on the playoff-bound Canes on the back of a Dylan Cozens goal bookended by a pair of McLeod tallies, but few leads are safe with this team—they&#x27;ve blown two multi-goal leads this month alone, including in their previous game. And the Canes roared back with a pair in the third, as they dominated the ice, outshooting Buffalo 8-0 in the frame and 37-24 on the night.</span>

                              <span>The Milwaukee Bucks have posted a 20–10 record since the first week of November, rising over that time from the bottom of the East up to fourth. Their rotten start certainly will continue to weigh on their playoff positioning—they can entirely forget about fighting for the East&#x27;s top seed—but the Bucks are now clear of the play-in mess. An honest sizing-up of the field suggests things will probably stay this way: The couple of semi-credible teams behind them in the standings are either crabbed to hell (Orlando) or caught in states of dopey semi-seriousness (Indiana and Atlanta). Pending further notice, the Bucks are no longer Milwaukee Butt.
On Wednesday night, they beat the hell out of a Magic team stripped by injury of all but one of their handful of guys capable of making the basketball go into the basket. This was a laugher from very early on. Orlando led, 9–8, after a slow start, but from about the 7:30 mark of the first quarter the Bucks ripped off 19 straight points, and then went ahead by 26 points early in the second quarter. The game was never much of a contest again.</span>

                              <span>Since Jan. 7, devastating fires in and around Los Angeles have burned more than 40,000 acres of land, an area slightly larger than Washington D.C. They have razed or damaged more than 12,300 homes and other structures. At least 24 people have died. This number will likely rise as the fires continue to burn and leave communities with not only the lingering carcinogenic effects of wildfire smoke, but also the chemicals emitted as buildings burn. Although the particulars of the destruction may have been unpredictable, the fires were not. Southern California has been bone dry for the better part of a year, and temperatures in the American Southwest have been warmer than average over the past three months. One climate scientist, Daniel Swain of the University of California Los Angeles, wrote a blog post on Jan. 4 warning that &quot;a high-end offshore wind/fire event may unfold in SoCal this week.&quot;
To grasp the full extent of the conditions that sparked the fires, it is important not just to look to this last, dry summer but also the unusually wet winters that preceded it. This cycle between extremely dry conditions and extremely wet conditions is known as &quot;hydroclimate whiplash,&quot; and in an eerie coincidence, Swain and colleagues, including Danielle Touma, a climate scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, published a review paper on the subject this week, in the journal Nature Reviews Earth &amp; Environment. As Touma noted, such coincidences are likely to become more commonplace as extreme weather events become more frequent amid climate change.</span>

                              <span>Sometimes, I remember how it felt to believe. The aching, constant hum that was always inside me. Faith is not always the rare and precious feeling of wonder that arrives without warning, when the nature of the world stretches out in front of you and catches in your throat. That is awe, which can—if you believe—reinvigorate the faithful, remind them of glory and power and majesty. But faith itself is like love: as magical and revolutionary as it is mundane and commonplace.
Real faith exhausts. It demands. It becomes rote even for the most ardent. There is a reason that most churches adopt some kind of liturgy; you cannot reinvent a wheel that must be constantly in use. To believe something with every atom of your being requires you to let it take over. There are only so many awe-inspiring moments in a life; most of a life is sweeping the floor and clicking on the computer and running an errand. Faith is not what you do in a church on Sunday; faith is a whole life.</span>

                              <span>A 24-hour business trip to Cleveland four days before Christmas was a bad idea; I see that now. There wasn&#x27;t even that much snow, by Lake Erie standards, but Delta Airlines didn&#x27;t seem to care that I had 10 pounds of potatoes to grate for a Chanukah party the next day and was leaving to visit my mother the day after that. There was no open seat to New York that night, nor the next day until 9:00 p.m. I was stuck. I was despondent.
I had dated a guy from the Cleveland suburbs in my 20s long enough to learn the hard way that there&#x27;s not all that much to recommend in the city. But I vaguely remembered that locals there love to brag about their art museum, and that seemed like a better way to pass the time than walking forlornly around an empty, windblown downtown. I booked a room in the hotel across the street from the Cleveland Museum of Art. I figured I&#x27;d spend an hour breezing through the gallery the next morning and then find something else to distract myself from my plight.</span>

                              <span>Things are going badly for Barcelona forward Ansu Fati. The 22-year-old&#x27;s career prospects have been dwindling for something like four straight years, as a succession of leg injuries (and accompanying extended absences) have thrown him miles off the developmental track that once made him one of the world&#x27;s brightest wonderteens. After returning from an unfruitful loan to Brighton for the 2023–24 season, he now finds himself an afterthought at Barça. Lately he cannot even break into match-day squads. The holder of several records as the youngest-ever goalscorer in this or that competition has not scored or assisted in any competition in more than a year.
If he is to have any realistic chance of rebuilding his career, Fati very clearly needs to leave Barcelona, either on a permanent transfer or an extended loan to a smaller club where he can get lots and lots of playing time. Unfortunately, his gargantuan salary, negotiated several leg-kablooeys ago, makes this a very difficult circle to square. The kind of club that could afford to take on his wage generally would not pay that much for, or dedicate guaranteed buckets of playing time to, such a dubious reclamation project; the kind of club that could guarantee him buckets of playing time would have to mangle its squad salary structure to pay him. Meanwhile you can imagine why a 22-year-old who has had more knee surgeries than completed 90-minute match appearances in the past half decade might balk at the idea of an 80-percent pay cut for the sake of leaving a club he joined as a 10-year-old. It&#x27;s a tough situation! But that&#x27;s not really what this blog is about.</span>

                              <span>Avid readers of Defector will not be surprised that Liverpool is still the top team in the Premier League standings. I&#x27;ve written plenty about how impressive the Reds have been under Arne Slot this season, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll write plenty more. The team currently in second place, however, deserves some flowers as well, as Nottingham Forest, the little money tree that could, just finished taking four points from its two matches against that same Liverpool. After handing the league leaders what is still their only league loss of the season back in September, and at Anfield to boot, on Tuesday Forest played hosts and came out with a 1-1 draw that served to further solidify the Trees&#x27; table-scaling legitimacy.

                              <span>On Monday night, I booted up League Pass to watch the end of Pistons-Knicks, and I was treated to a spectacular finish, with Malik Beasley hitting huge threes and talking wild shit while Cade Cunningham cooked two All-NBA defenders en route to another star-making performance. During a replay review, I flipped over to Warriors-Raptors, where I got to see Buddy Hield legitimate a Chris Boucher masterclass with a signature moment of comedic hubris, the sort only he is capable of. After those games wrapped, I locked in for the fourth quarter of Grizzlies-Rockets, the best frame of the night. There was Ja Morant, nailing halfcourt bombs and frying the most athletic player in the NBA; there was Jalen Green, finishing up an efficient 42-point night and continuing his impressive, important January; and there was Amen Thompson, doing his pure destroyer act.
It was an amazing night of basketball, one that, according to a certain discursive strain, does not matter—or at any rate matters less than the question of how many people watched it on TV. NBA ratings squawking is not a novel phenomenon, nor an interesting one. Every year, the season starts while the World Series and football season are in full swing, and so some people watch those things instead of NBA basketball. And because that happens alongside cable television&#x27;s general slide into the abyss, the numbers wobble. Then those allergic to context form grandiose theories, mistaking the relative viewership decline for an absolute one and linking it to any number of bogeymen: load management, too many three-pointers, or, most cynically of all, wokeness, which is another word for &quot;black people on my television.&quot;</span>

But we are going to be brave and trust the process. Week 1 of The Artist&#x27;s Way was an introduction to the practice. This week, we read about the self-sabotaging &quot;blurts&quot; that come out from our inner critics, and practiced paying attention to them without giving them too much power. We also have our first week of daily morning pages under our belt! Kathryn, Ray, Sabrina, Chris, and Alex all started Week 1 last week and, as promised, we are here to share our end-of-week reflections.
If you&#x27;re following along at home, we&#x27;d love to see your responses in the comments, too.</span>

                              <span>On Monday, Italian soccer club Lazio fired its longtime falconer Juan Bernabé after the 56-year-old Spaniard posted photos on social media of, uh, himself following a penile implant surgery. In a statement, Lazio said &quot;[w]e, and the historic symbol of the eagle, can no longer be associated with a person who with his behaviour has made the continuation of any relationship impossible.&quot; The club also said it was &quot;stunned&quot; to see the photos. As a result of Bernabé&#x27;s firing, the club&#x27;s eagle, Olimpia, will not fly at upcoming matches, as is tradition. Lazio&#x27;s statement acknowledged the &quot;hurt&quot; that will be felt by the club&#x27;s fans over Olimpia&#x27;s absence.
Bernabé, who had been with the club since 2010, was operated on by Lazio&#x27;s resident urologist, Gabriele Antonini. According to Spanish newspaper El Confidencial, the two met at the club&#x27;s training ground, Formello. In an interview with Spanish radio station Radio24, Bernabé explained that the implant allows him to control his erections and how long he lasts during sexual activity, explaining that he &quot;has to ejaculate whenever I have some free time.&quot; He went on to say that it was a &quot;marvelous surgery&quot; and that his erection is &quot;natural, but with this implant, I can press a button that lets me perfectly control both the erection and the duration.&quot; If you&#x27;re interested in seeing the offending images, let me first me first try to disabuse you of your curiosity, but if that doesn&#x27;t work, here you go.</span>

                              <span>The explanations are both tiresome and unsatisfactory. The 14-3 Minnesota Vikings were annihilated 27-9 in their opening playoff game last night against Los Angeles Rams. Two weeks ago, Minnesota was a lone victory away from securing the No. 1 seed in the NFC and the attendant boost in DVOA Super Bowl odds that would come with it. They had one of the best defenses in the NFL. They had Justin Jefferson. They weren’t supposed to be this good, but they were as legit as any other team at the top of the standings.
Most important, they had a quarterback in Sam Darnold who, unlike his predecessor, had developed a knack for shaking off mistakes and making big-boy throws in big-boy moments. For 17 weeks, Darnold was one of the best passers in football. I saw it. I saw him put a 97-yard dagger into San Francisco. I saw him hit the mute button on the Seahawks home crowd with a game-winning rainbow to Jefferson, in the freezing rain. I saw him sweep the Packers and get his own Rudy moment in the locker room afterward. This was the quarterback that Sam Darnold, an impending free agent, was always meant to be.</span>

                              <span>At the end of 2024, Philadelphia city council voted 12-5 to approve the 76ers&#x27; ownership group&#x27;s plans to build a new arena, named 76 Place, in Center City, after two years of contention from Chinatown residents and business owners. The final deal exempted 76ers&#x27; ownership, Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment, from paying property tax over their 30-year lease at the location, and instead required HBSE to make $5 million a year in payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTs) and a $60 million commitment to community benefits such as transit and after-school programs, down from the original $100 million that the council was requesting. The detailed impacts of an arena on the neighborhood and city under that deal can be found here, but in short, team owners Josh Harris and David Blitzer would save anywhere from $97 million to $273 million in tax benefits; the direct heuristic of the Washington Wizards&#x27; arena in D.C.&#x27;s Chinatown doesn&#x27;t paint a rosy picture for the community&#x27;s future. The deal would be far from the worst that a city has borne in terms of new stadium construction, but with potentially very high downside.
Not that any of that is relevant anymore. On Sunday Jan. 12, less than a month after the city council vote, the 76ers announced that they would not be building a new arena in Center City, and will instead remain in South Philly, with plans to construct a new arena within the extant sports complex. The conflict that drove the initial plan to move to Center City—an inability to reach an agreement with the current landlord at the team&#x27;s Comcast Spectator–owned arena—was miraculously resolved. According to an official press release from the 76ers, the new deal includes Comcast taking a minority ownership stake in the company, plus plans to bring a new WNBA team to the city.</span>
