                              <span>The way Amanda Cronin sees it, her environmental education began at the farmers&#x27; market in her hometown in New York&#x27;s Hudson Valley. She marveled at the sheer abundance of produce, so much so that, at age 11, she became the market&#x27;s on-camera personality. Every Saturday, she would go to the market and interview a farmer about their growing process, such as how olive oil becomes &quot;extra virgin.&quot; She tasted her first oysters and learned about the distinction between organic foods and other green-washed labels. Eventually she read Michael Pollan&#x27;s The Omnivore&#x27;s Dilemma, which cemented the idea that &quot;our food system is broken and Big Ag is really corrupt,&quot; she said.
Cronin started working directly for the planet at the age of 13. She interned for an organization called iMatter Youth, which encompassed youth-led organizing for the climate crisis. &quot;Because I was so young, I couldn&#x27;t really be a full-time employee,&quot; she said. iMatter Youth&#x27;s mission was to train youth activists across the country to make changes at a municipal level, exposing Cronin not just to the power of environmental policy, but the concept of environmental justice: the idea that everyone, regardless of race, class, or any other identity, deserves the same environmental protections and benefits. The idea just made sense to her. &quot;I grew up in a very privileged place where I had access to clean water, clean air, a backyard to roam around in,&quot; she said. &quot;I didn&#x27;t have to worry about living near a power plant, or have direct environmental harms.&quot;</span>

Before we get to the festivities, a quick “only in New York” story for all of youse. I drive into the city on Thursday to visit my friend. I park my car in a garage because I’m don’t have the energy to battle it out for a street spot. It’s one of those tight garages with a car elevator to accommodate all of the inventory, so you have to surrender your keys to them, visions of the joyriding parking attendants from Ferris Bueller dancing through your neuroses. This isn’t my first time in such a garage, so I give up my key fob and then go about my business.</span>

                              <span>NFL kicker Justin Tucker is currently under investigation by the league because 16 massage therapists have accused him of sexual misconduct. On Monday, he was released by the only team he&#x27;s ever played for, the Baltimore Ravens. But if those two things are related, the Ravens are pointedly refusing to admit it.
The way that Baltimore announced Tucker&#x27;s exit would have made perfect sense if you saw it before January, when his claim to fame was still his lengthy run of incredible accuracy. The 35-year-old had a team-friendly out in his contract for this offseason, and he&#x27;s coming off the least effective year of his career. To that end, this statement—credited to EVP and GM Eric DeCosta—has all the hallmarks of a typical farewell to a beloved veteran-in-decline. &quot;Sometimes football decisions are incredibly difficult, and this is one of those instances,&quot; it begins, presumably to avoid giving grounds for a potential NFLPA grievance.</span>

                              <span>After a long courting period and the slow march of inevitability, Trent Alexander-Arnold confirmed on Monday that he will be leaving Liverpool this summer, almost certainly to take his talents to Spain and Real Madrid. The news is hardly a shock, since reliable reports had for several months been saying this was going to happen, but it&#x27;s still noteworthy that the local lad, who has spent his entire youth and senior careers as a Pool Boy, is leaving Merseyside to test himself at the biggest club in the world.
Put that way, you can&#x27;t fault Alexander-Arnold, who won everything with Liverpool in his nine first-team seasons, including two Premier League trophies. The England international has appeared 330 times for Liverpool, scoring 21 goals and notching 82 often incredible assists (64 of those came in the Premier League, a record for a defender), and though he may have taken some reputational knocks for his lackluster defending, there&#x27;s little to criticize about his tenure at his boyhood club, which also included an FA Cup, two League Cups, and the 2018-19 Champions League trophy. For almost the entirety of his time marauding down the right flank as a right back/playmaker/passing genius, Alexander-Arnold was one of the engines that drove Liverpool in this era of success, and his partnership especially with Mohamed Salah made opposing left backs squirm under repeated interplays and pinpoint crosses.</span>

                              <span>The night your author got Popped came at the onset of an epic hangover nobody quite knew about yet. More specifically, it came early in the 2017 Western Conference Finals that elevated the Golden State Warriors and slowly but surely undid the San Antonio Spurs. Two days earlier, Kawhi Leonard had landed on Zaza Pachulia&#x27;s foot on a shot in front of the San Antonio bench, ending his season and obliterating most of the next. That moment fundamentally changed the ensuing years of professional basketball more than any other player, team, or event. Nobody knew that then, of course, but it dawned on Gregg Popovich before it did for anyone except perhaps Leonard himself.
The Spurs, who were up 76-55 in the third quarter of the game when Leonard got hurt, went on to lose it 113-111; they dropped Game 2 by the score of 136-100, and then lost the two after that. Until that moment the Spurs had been, in the previous 20 years under Popovich, demonstrably and by a wide margin the best team in the sport; since then, they are 25th.</span>

                              <span>The Maple Leafs started off about as well as a team can, with William Nylander scoring his first of two goals 33 seconds in, and building to a three-goal lead before the game&#x27;s midway point, after which they held on for a 5-4 victory over the Panthers. It&#x27;s a big change from the last time they faced Florida, when, two years ago, in their only taste of the second round in forever, they went down 0-3 in the series and fell in five. And yet this win tastes a little bitter, because of the I-word: implications. It&#x27;s got &#x27;em, thanks to Sam Bennett forcing goalie Anthony Stolarz from the game with an elbow to the head.
There hasn&#x27;t been a formal update on Stolarz, but he was taken to the hospital for observation in an ambulance, after cameras caught him vomiting on the bench a few minutes after the Bennett hit—classic concussion stuff. He&#x27;s out of the hospital this morning, at least. There was no penalty called on the play, and it&#x27;s not clear if Bennett will face supplemental discipline from the league, but the Leafs were furious. &quot;Elbow to the head,&quot; head coach Craig Berube said. &quot;Clearly. Clear as day. I&#x27;m not sure why there wasn&#x27;t a call on it, but it was clearly a penalty.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Hypothetical: You are an NBA head coach and your team is leading a playoff game by three points with 11.1 seconds to go. The opposing team is getting ready to inbound the ball from under their own basket, they have no timeouts, and their best player is stuck on the bench. Do you foul and send them to the line, or trust your ferocious defenders—I forgot to mention that you have the best defense in the league—to get set and deal with what will surely be a semi-panicked attempt to fling up a potential game-tying shot? If you&#x27;re Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault, you choose to lose the game.
It is always cruel and simplistic to hang a bad result on one play, decision, or even set of decisions, but Daigneault cannot be spared the hot light of scrutiny after he and the Thunder fumbled away Game 1 of their second-round series against the Denver Nuggets. The Thunder were up 11 with 4:31 left to play, and seemed ready to put away a game that they had led and dominated all night. A shocking 12-2 Nuggets run made it 115-114 with 1:07 to play, which is about when the bad decisions started being made. The teams traded misses on the next two possessions, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander ended up at the line with 14 seconds left. He hit both free throws to put the Thunder up by three.</span>

Cardenas, obviously overmatched by Japanese opponent Naoya Inoue in everything but heart, knocked the mythically powerful champ down with a lightning-quick and savage left hook in the second round of their thrilling and brutal super bantamweight title fight Sunday in Las Vegas. And for a few moments, the 29-year-old, 122-pound Texan seemed on the verge of pulling off one of boxing’s biggest all-time upsets.</span>

This is not an exaggeration, or fluke of the weather, or any particular driver underperformance. As Lewis Hamilton said after the Ferraris qualified P8 and P12, &quot;On pure pace, we&#x27;ve been out-qualified by a Williams.&quot; Fact check: The Ferraris were outqualified by two Williams cars.
Charles Leclerc&#x27;s despondency post-qualifying was equally damning. &quot;When I finish a lap, again today in qualifying, I feel very satisfied with my lap, but it&#x27;s only bringing us, whatever it is,&quot; Leclerc said. &quot;P8 or something.&quot;</span>

                              <span>This is not a website known for holding back when an athlete gives an egregious performance on a big stage, but even I, the cynical blogger hardened by years of easy insults, couldn&#x27;t help but feel my heart sink when Connor Hellebuyck let in two goals on the St. Louis Blues&#x27; first four shots. I&#x27;ve referred to the 10-year Winnipeg Jets vet as the league&#x27;s hardest-working goalie—this regular season was his fifth topping the NHL in games played—but yet again, it looked like he took an untimely vacation when his team needed him most. It required some incredible Jets magic to bring Hellebuyck back from Fraudwatch, but that&#x27;s exactly what his teammates did.
Up until three seconds remained in Game 7, Hellebuyck&#x27;s last three years had all followed a frustrating pattern. In the regular season, he would be an absolute workhorse who produced staggering shot-stopping numbers—the kind that could singlehandedly lift any team into Cup contention. But as soon as the playoffs started, that skill would mysteriously desert him. In 2023, the Golden Knights dispatched the Jets in five as Hellebuyck&#x27;s save percentage plummeted from .920 in the regular season to .886 for the series. In 2024, Helle won the Vezina Trophy for the second time in his career but made the ceremony a bit awkward by putting up a 5.23 goals against average in a five-game loss to the Avalanche. This series, against a streaking Blues squad, saw him hit a new career low—three yanks in three road losses where he allowed a total of 16 goals, with an overall first-round save percentage of just .830. In his lowest moments, including the first period on Sunday, Jets skaters weren&#x27;t doing anything to ease his burden. But as the team&#x27;s most important guy—maybe the single most important guy on any team—it was Hellebuyck&#x27;s job to provide a solid foundation, and instead he was the sinkhole.</span>

                              <span>In August, Charla Burnett moved from Michigan to Washington D.C., with her 5-year-old son, for a new job. She joined the first class of USAID Science for Development fellows, working on energy subsidy reform, AI data center placements, and expanding access to renewables around the world. The post would be a stepping stone to full-time employment at USAID as a foreign service officer, which was Burnett&#x27;s ultimate dream. Burnett was set to take the Foreign Service Exam in February. She took her official USAID portraits on Jan. 11, posing in front of the agency&#x27;s flag, and soon received the watermarked versions. To Burnett, this felt like a milestone—one she&#x27;d been working toward for 13 years. &quot;I felt like I finally made it,&quot; Burnett said. Weeks later, she was fired. Ten days after that, the administration canceled her exam.
Hoping, at least, to retain one artifact of her time in federal service, Burnett emailed and asked if the photographer could send her the actual headshots. But he never emailed her back. Burnett suspects he was also fired. &quot;Complete breakdown of communication by everyone, because everyone just got let go,&quot; she said.</span>

                              <span>The NBA playoffs are in full swing, and as such, I find myself watching and talking about the games with people who do not watch as much basketball as I do, probably because watching basketball is not their job. A perceptual phenomenon that quickly becomes apparent is that there is so much happening on the TV screen at every moment of a basketball game that it is not easily possible to take in everything in real-time. If you simply watch the ball, you will miss most of what goes on during a possession. Hardcore fans accept this as background radiation, and I ultimately find something beautiful in the existence of such a limit.
I have a suspicion, then, that while most people who are serious about basketball-watching are perceiving the same gestalt, they are assembling that whole out of different arrangements of constituent parts. This is true in the macro sense, as two people can get equal amounts of satisfaction by focusing variably on who is doing cool moves and which offensive system is operating more harmoniously, though what I am talking about is the micro sense: Where does your focus shift? What do you look at during a basketball game?</span>

                              <span>They say the home crowd was extremely noisy Sunday night, in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinal series between the Indiana Pacers and the Cleveland Cavaliers. Play-by-play guy Spero Dedes called it &quot;just deafening.&quot; Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle, asked about the challenge facing his young team in the second round of the playoffs, didn&#x27;t even mention the opponent. &quot;This place is very loud, very crazy,&quot; he told TNT sideline reporter Jared Greenberg, after the first quarter. 
I&#x27;ll have to take their word for it, and not only because my home sound system is pathetic: The broadcast quality sucked shit! After a big awkward crap-out in this same arena back on April 21, TNT&#x27;s audio was all screwed up again Sunday. Greg Anthony sounded like he was dialing in via Zoom, or had his head submerged in water. Since no one in particular wants to hear from Anthony, this presented more an annoying distraction than a real deficit of information. Several times Dedes&#x27;s voice was swallowed up at random, so that whatever it was he had to say about a particular event suddenly sounded as if it was being mumbled by someone at the other end of a hallway. Worst of all, the mix deadened crowd noise, so that it was hard to connect with Dedes when he said, during a third-quarter run by the home team, that the arena was the loudest he&#x27;d ever heard. I considered the possibility that he was gassing up the event with hyperbole, but the rim noises were distracting and Anthony&#x27;s voice continued to sound as if it was being bounced off of Voyager 2, so it was easy enough to accept that TNT simply did not want home viewers to experience any of the crowd&#x27;s ear-splitting enthusiasm.</span>

                              <span>Game Sevens take on many forms, and far more often than not the words Game and Seven are heavier on promise than delivery. In a world of rapidly shrinking attention spans, those games are expected to validate the results of Game Six, because we only recall the last thing we saw and imagine that the coaches are out of ideas.
Rarely, though, do Game Sevens deviate from the established norms of the preceding six games the way that Golden State and Houston did on Sunday night. We can start with the obvious plot line: Buddy Hield, Postseason Hero, a phrase making its debut in the English language here.</span>

                              <span>No hockey team has historically killed joy faster than the Winnipeg Jets. When they make the postseason, they appear quietly and leave moments later. In fact, Winnipeg itself is from the Cree word for, &quot;lost in the first round.&quot; They have been so committed to the bit that it’s still not clear that they actually won Game 7 over the St. Louis Blues Sunday night, even though I have watched the game twice since the actual game ended. The Jets don&#x27;t win that game because the Jets never win that game.
But here we are. The Jets, known mostly for their seemingly incurable playoff interruptus, set themselves up for yet another galling failure Sunday night and actually failed to fail in a situation where failure was all but assured. They parlayed the league’s best record and the best goalie and turned it into a humiliating 3-1 defeat … that is, until the final 116 seconds of regulation, when they turned it into the first bedtime story Jets fans will tell their grandchildren without firing down a slug of Caribou Crossing to dull the pain.</span>

                              <span>In order to watch The Settlers, I first had to fraudulently assert my right to do so. The latest film by much-lauded documentarian Louis Theroux was broadcast earlier this week on BBC Two, and is available to stream via BBC iPlayer, which you can only access with an IP address in the UK (an international release date is apparently coming soon.) So I lied in order to have the thing I wanted, which seemed fitting enough. 
Theroux has made a name for itself over the years as someone uniquely skilled at getting people to reveal truths they might rather hide. He approaches his subjects—often people with reprehensible beliefs, like Afrikaner separatists or members of the Westboro Baptist Church—with a disarming affability. His slightly naive persona is matched by his physical presence: generally folding in on himself as if embarrassed about his height, bespectacled face often scrunched in a quizzical expression, looking always in danger of tripping over something. He invites people to explain themselves without passing judgment in the moment, relying instead on heavy silences or a voiceover.</span>

                              <span>Let&#x27;s get one thing straight: We eagles obey no courts of law. We heed no judges. We&#x27;ve never even heard of the concept that you call &quot;police.&quot; So however many times you try to tell me that everything I say can and will be used against me in a court of law, your threats mean nothing to me. The carceral system is for you puny humans, not us noble eagles. I don&#x27;t come into your home and tell you how to live your life! OK? OK. With that understanding, I will now share my side of the story.
I was minding my business in the tropical forests of French Guiana, which, as you may imagine, is my home. I live by the Kourou River Basin, near the coast, and aside from the occasional ecotourist, my home is undisturbed. Would I prefer a home free of uninvited guests? Yes, obviously. But do I generally put up with a few sightseers? Yes, because I am not an asshole. I watch these tourists as they take photos of smaller, less noble birds, like those annoying-as-hell great kiskadees squawking all day long or those twangy silver-beaked tanagers. All the real big players in the forest, like me and the jaguars, are too smart to be &quot;captured&quot; by a &quot;content creator.&quot; But occasionally, when I&#x27;m feeling generous or having a great feather day, I&#x27;ll cock my head and emerge from my perch high in the canopy to give them a little show. I watch them as they snap photos of me with their obscenely phallic camera lenses. In this, at least, we are aligned: I&#x27;m literally stunning. If I saw me perched elegantly overhead, I too would have to stop and stare.</span>

                              <span>Considered from an appropriate distance, there is nothing all that noteworthy about the Denver Nuggets prevailing in their first-round series against the Los Angeles Clippers. An evenly matched series eventually broke in the direction of the team with home-court advantage; the team with the best player in the series won it; the Clippers looked noticeably gassed throughout Game 7 after spending a great deal of physical and mental energy to stave off elimination in Game 6. This is pretty much how all this stuff is supposed to go. The fun of watching sports, however, is not just in observing outcomes. It&#x27;s in feeling the texture of each moment leading up to a result. It&#x27;s in all the little stories that get told about players and teams over the course of a seven-game series.
Coming into this series, the story of the Nuggets season was one of angst. The team proved just how disappointing a 50-win season can feel, and the end-of-season firings of head coach Michael Malone and general manager Calvin Booth were the front office&#x27;s way of admitting that an untenable toxicity had infected the whole organization. Through no fault of his own, the source of all this anxiety was Nikola Jokic. Booth and Malone split the franchise into warring factions due to their inability to agree on how best to build a winning roster around the best player in the world. Every loss and stretch of lifeless play stung so bad precisely because of how great of an individual season Jokic was having. Everyone was letting the big fella down, and everyone felt terrible about it.</span>

                              <span>It is only sort of true to say that you know what you&#x27;re going to get when Donald Trump sits for a television interview. It is true in the sense that, after a decade spent alternately threatening and occupying the White House, everyone knows how he is going to act. There is some more uncertainty when it comes to what Trump is actually going to do, but even these variables aren&#x27;t notably variable. He is going to act like Donald Trump, or some version of Donald Trump. This is something that can be prepared for, to some extent.
If he is being interviewed by someone from one of the television channels he likes, Trump will be drawling and digressive in his familiar toastmaster mode, the tone he puts on when he is Making Some Remarks before an audience that he senses is eager to applaud him. &quot;A little secret,&quot; he told Fox News&#x27; Laura Ingraham while showing her around his increasingly cluttered and gilded oval office, &quot;throughout the years, people have tried to come up with a gold paint that would look like gold. And they&#x27;ve never been able to do it.&quot; No, Ingraham agreed, in a tone of hushed awe, while the Fox camera focused on a dorky little golden cherub above a door. &quot;That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s gold.&quot; He sounds like he&#x27;s talking in his sleep, murmuring through a dream in which he is doing exactly this sort of thing. That&#x27;s one version.</span>

                              <span>&quot;Long-suffering&quot; in a sporting context is largely nonsense, for the very simple reason that the people who complain about it are doing no suffering whatsoever. They&#x27;re choosing to watch an unaccomplished team, and that&#x27;s all. We don&#x27;t need to run down the list of people who are actually suffering, given that the list is growing hourly, but it surely isn&#x27;t sports fans. In other words, please take time out of your busy and productive days to shut the hell up. 
Besides, suffering even in this milieu is entirely an eye-of-the-beholder deal. New York Knicks fans suffer far less than, say, Charlotte Hornets/ Bobcats/Hornets Again fans, who since losing their original team in 2002, have gotten a new one, missed the playoffs 18 of 21 years, and lost the only three series they have ever played in. Next to this, the prototypical Knicks fan suffers only because of their own idiotic expectations. The notion that because they haven&#x27;t won a title in 52 years means they&#x27;re due is exactly the way gamblers go broke.</span>

                              <span>If you enjoy old-timey American pastimes, have I got a weekend for you! Three consecutive nights of televised title fights! Who invited the mid-1950s? 
The fistic windfall kicks off tonight with a poorly planned and bizarrely promoted but intriguing-as-all-getout three-fight, Saudi-sponsored pay-per-view outdoor card at Times Square in New York, with a feature match pitting Ryan Garcia coming back from a PED suspension and intoxicant-addled haze to face Rolly Romero for a welterweight world championship belt. Then on Saturday, boxing&#x27;s top international draw, Mexico&#x27;s Canelo Alvarez, celebrates another Cinco de Mayo season in the ring in Riyadh, boxing&#x27;s new Las Vegas, where he&#x27;ll fight perhaps the most anonymous champion extant, William Scull, for a super middleweight title. And the capper, maybe best bout of &#x27;em all, comes Sunday in the old Las Vegas, as Japanese KO king Naoya Inoue brings his powers to the west to face Ramon Cardenas for the undisputed junior featherweight championship.</span>

While Rudy Gobert is still busy collecting his 96th rebound against a Lakers team that tried to advance in the NBA playoffs without a frontcourt, the Vikings have used this week as an occasion to unofficially cap off a rebuilding project that they started three years ago:

                              <span>TOKYO — Last year, when I visited Major League ballparks in Philadelphia and Minnesota for the first time, I made the same obvious-but-still-true observation: &quot;It looks like it does on TV.&quot; Well, Korakuen Hall feels like it does on TV, or at least, on the Japanese wrestling streams I watch on my laptop: unadorned, practical, dignified. Arriving at Tokyo&#x27;s wrestling epicenter last month, my brain still reeling from an international flight that had landed only the night earlier, I had a hard time distinguishing between my actual presence and the idea that I might be dreaming the whole thing. It was as if the setting had sprung out of two dimensions. The simple bleachers; the &quot;East&quot; and &quot;West&quot; signs, in kanji and English, on either end; the small balconies with banners hanging from them—I had seen it all before, kind of. I had never been within 5,000 miles of it, yet this was a room I knew intimately.
I went to Tokyo, basically, to see Korakuen Hall. I&#x27;m about to turn 30, and I have the normal feelings about that. Plus, I&#x27;d never traveled internationally except to Canada. I wanted to mark the big 3-0, and also see what it was like out there. So I did some big-time flying around the Pacific, the majority of it by myself, with a few specific destinations in mind. It was an amazing trip, one that affirmed my confidence in my resourcefulness and independence while also reminding me of my incredible luck. But I really think the crown jewel of it all—four cities in four different countries on three continents—was the pro wrestling. I went to three shows at Korakuen—plus one mini-adventure to the outlying wrestling shed Shin-Kiba 1st Ring to see an intimate show from the deathmatch promotion Freedoms—and this building that I had admired from so far away, miraculously, gave me exactly what I was hoping to find.</span>

                              <span>Welcome to The Backlog, a series in which we will take a look back at 12 games from 2020 that, in one way or another, had a lasting impact on the video game industry. 
Final Fantasy VII is one of the most important video games in history. The game, which came out in 1997, was the first Final Fantasy to go 3D and use 32-bit graphics, a departure from the 16-bit style of (the phenomenal) Final Fantasy VI. It sold beyond anyone&#x27;s wildest expectations, notching over a million sales in its first week, and introduced a host of players to the series, which had been consistently excellent but perhaps overlooked in the West. And its story, an environmentalist fable that cast the player as part of an eco-terrorist group called Avalanche, was simple yet masterfully executed. For fans of Japanese role-playing games, Final Fantasy VII was manna from heaven, a guiding step forward for the genre.</span>

                              <span>Neither of the Knicks and Pistons ever really channeled the necessary competence to win their first-round playoff series in convincing fashion, and so its outcome was largely left to the bounces of fate. The series, which ended 4-2 in favor of the Knicks after last night&#x27;s 116–113 victory, could have just as easily gone the other way had a few moments (and one particularly big one) unfolded differently. The same can be said about a lot of playoff series, though, and what usually ends up making the difference are the players who can cut through the randomness at the right time.
Jalen Brunson, who finished with 40 points on 15-of-33 shooting in Game 6, does not always feel like one of those players. He is undoubtedly one of the best clutch performers in the league, but his style of play often makes it feel like he is guided through those moments not by athletic genius, but a intrinsic Mr. Magoo–style talent for ending up where he needs to be. At its worst, this looks like a lot of flopping. At its best, this looks like Brunson dribbling and jump-stopping himself into trouble, and then using his incredible footwork and body control to force open a shooting angle that didn&#x27;t previously exist. Watching this series mostly left me with the certainty that Brunson would drive me absolutely insane if he was playing against my team. Stop letting him do that stuff! He&#x27;s too tiny for that!</span>

                              <span>As a child, Claire Sneed had a morbid fascination with natural disasters. In first grade, she followed NOAA&#x27;s online storm tracker. Later she witnessed Hurricanes Irene and Sandy sweep past her home in the Philadelphia area. On visits to Santa Fe to see her grandfather, Sneed marveled at the dramatic cliffs of Bandelier National Monument, which were formed by staggering volcanic explosions a million years ago. In 2000, a prescribed fire escaped, whipped by high winds, and eventually burned around 1,000 acres across the monument. Sneed was fascinated by how such a massive landscape was altered by wildfire. &quot;I think it was just a combination of how powerless you feel in the sense when you&#x27;re met with natural disasters,&quot; she said. &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of resilience, both in the natural world and in human communities, that comes together after natural disasters.&quot;
While in college, Sneed spent her summer breaks working on AmeriCorps programs in the West. She worked on wilderness trail crews clearing fallen trees, constructing bridges, and repairing trails affected by wildfire and erosion in Colorado. &quot;All of that was trail crew related work, but I kind of fell in love with public lands,&quot; she said. After Sneed graduated in May 2024, she started a permanent seasonal position as a hydrologic technician at Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming. There, she worked to ensure streams, rivers, and wetlands complied with environmental regulations like the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, a designation that determines how much water can be removed from a river sustainably.</span>

                              <span>It is the nature of the NBA, for reasons that only intermittently have anything to do with the league itself, that it is discussed as if it&#x27;s in crisis. A lot of this is just how sports are talked about now, which is as reflexive and sour as every other big public discourse. The NBA regular season really is too long, but still it must be said: We are into the good part now, and the playoffs have been—pardon the jargon here—extremely fun and good. So Drew and I welcomed Patrick Redford, one of Defector&#x27;s foremost basketball likers, to talk about that.</span>

But now I know that I will die having seen the rings of Saturn through a telescope. I would like you to make sure that you, too, die that way. Wait, that sounds ominous.
Let me back up. It was about a decade ago, at some open house event at my neighborhood arts center, and someone had brought a telescope. I don&#x27;t think he worked there; I think he just liked bringing his telescope places and letting people look through it. It wasn&#x27;t even a particularly large telescope, to my eye: easily portable, set up on a tripod, and with a line of just two or three people waiting to use it. Can I look?, I asked, stupidly. You bet.</span>

                              <span>As if in response to my minor complaint about the cagey first leg of the Arsenal vs. Paris Saint-Germain Champions League semifinal, the other semifinal, between Barcelona and Internazionale, served as a stark counterpart. A wide-open 3-3 thriller, up there with the best first-leg knockout matches of the tournament&#x27;s last decade, had almost too much action to recap. The goals came hard and fast, and with almost otherworldly quality, from both sides, and Inter especially weathered a furious storm to pick its spots and send the tie back to Italy for the second leg all knotted up.
That&#x27;s not to say, though, that all the goals, or even all the performances, were created equal. If ever a six-goal masterpiece could be distilled down to the exploits of one player, it was Wednesday&#x27;s match. That player was, as it already has been in big-ticket showdowns and as it looks like it might be for years to come, Lamine Yamal, Barcelona&#x27;s 17-year-old (17!) winger who isn&#x27;t just the best prospect in the world by a mile; he might already be the best player on the planet, a whirlwind of technical prowess and creativity that European soccer hasn&#x27;t seen since, well, another teenager suited up in the same club&#x27;s colors.</span>

The strategy so far: more open contempt. Let&#x27;s see how this goes for them.
On Wednesday afternoon, the North Carolina football coach released a statement through the school, claiming that CBS and interviewer Tony Dokoupil had breached some kind of agreement to keep the topics limited to Belichick&#x27;s new book:</span>

                              <span>In April, after months of tech-dipshit palace intrigue, photos of Mark Zuckerberg’s long-rumored D.C. mansion finally spread their way through social media. Because Zuckerberg is an immensely disliked figure for democracy-destroying and culture-annihilating reasons, mass architectural criticism was equally swift.
To social media users, the house looked like everything from a dorm at a mid-sized state college to, well, a McMansion—which it is, in spirit. The building itself, designed by long-time domestic architect for various elites, Robert Gurney, is not particularly flamboyant, at least as far as rich people&#x27;s houses are concerned. (Certainly it lacks the foam appliques so beloved by Donald Trump.) Clad monotonously in red brick, it features a central pared-down gable complete with a garage-door-esque picture window, flanked on either side by similarly gabled and frankly barn-like wings, each connected by breezeways.</span>

                              <span>The Minnesota Timberwolves eliminated the higher-seeded Los Angeles Lakers Wednesday night, in Game 5 of their first-round series. The final score, 103–96, suggests a closely fought contest, but what it really shows is the Timberwolves missing way more than the usual number of three-pointers, plus, sure, some dignity in defeat from the Lakers. Minnesota led, in Los Angeles, for every minute of the first half, and often by double digits; the Lakers scrambled back in the third quarter, but Minnesota just eased away without a whole lot of extraordinary effort down the stretch of the fourth. You had the sense, by the end, that if these teams played for another two or six or 30 games, the Wolves would spend the bulk of the time ahead by 11 points, with some wobbles in there to account for streaky shooting.
Lately, when the Timberwolves win, you expect it to be because Anthony Edwards did something cool, or possibly even incredible. It&#x27;s hard sometimes even to imagine how this year&#x27;s Timberwolves win games without their All-NBA shot-creator creating and making lots of shots for himself. When they edged the Lakers in Game 4, it was largely because Edwards manufactured a huge fourth quarter against an exhausted Lakers lineup missing any semblance of rim protection. Not so Wednesday: Edwards made just five shots in 42 minutes in Game 5, bricked all 11 of his three-point attempts, and finished with just 15 points, tied for his fifth-lowest scoring output of the entire season. He scored just once in the fourth quarter, and made it to the free-throw line not at all. That is not to say he played poorly—Edwards grabbed 11 rebounds on the night and was credited with eight assists, did not turn the ball over even once, and had a game-high three steals—but the Wolves never got, and in the end never needed, one of his big signature scoring explosions.</span>

                              <span>The Kentucky Derby is the undisputed crown jewel of a sport that has been diminishing in national notice for decades now, but it can stand in line on that. Kids just don&#x27;t go to the track anymore, which is a shame because it remains a great place for young people to learn to smoke cigarettes and leave the butts in someone else&#x27;s beer. The only real lure for fans outside Churchill Downs is the occasional Derby party, which is also the only time anyone drinks a mint julep. It&#x27;s an industry that screams old folks&#x27; amusement.

                              <span>ESPN published a fun oral history yesterday about how much it sucks to pitch at the Colorado Rockies&#x27; ballpark. The writers of the story wisely got in touch with current and former pitchers who have experienced the ERA-inflating effects of high-altitude pitching, and then let them recount their horror stories. I enjoyed the story a great deal, but one particular anecdote, from former Rockies reliever and current Seattle Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto, stuck out to me.

                              <span>FLUSHING, N.Y. — To be honest, I wanted to see Corbin Carroll and Juan Soto have a game. I was faintly aware of the Arizona Diamondbacks bravely holding up the rear of the competitive teams in the NL West (four of them!), but during an obligatory pre-game database check, I learned that Carroll was having an obscene start. Per FanGraphs, he has been the second-best position player this season; per a cursory glance at Baseball Savant sliders, he had pivoted from a hitting profile traditional to players primarily described as &quot;fast&quot;—above-average plate discipline that&#x27;ll get a guy on base well enough—to a faster swing and strikeout-happier approach that could—could!—mean he&#x27;s now a bona fide slugger who also happens to be extremely fast. Meanwhile for Soto, it was a bit simpler: Surely he was due a game at this point.
In the way these things usually go, I got neither. Carroll went 0-for-4. Soto, despite two smoked line drives into the outfield, went 0-for-3 with a walk. The game itself carried little tension. In spite of David Roth doomposting in Slack about the post-blog Mets being struck down by possible season-ending surgery and a stomach bug, the lineup smacked around Diamondbacks starter Eduardo Rodríguez in the third and fourth inning to rack up a near-unloseable 7–0 lead. At that point, for the underprepared game-goer trembling in the Citi Field 500-level like a chihuahua that more closely resembles a stick insect than a dog, the only rooting interests were for some highlights to get pumped up about, and a kind ending time with respect to the NJ Transit train schedule.</span>

                              <span>As any broadcast crew will point out the second he starts cooking, Jamal Murray owns a strange and wondrous NBA distinction: No player increases their scoring average more between the regular season and playoffs than Murray does. One can interpret that stat a number of ways, including asking the logical question of why someone who is so mission-critical to the Denver Nuggets winning anything serious can barely play himself onto all-star snub lists, but Murray&#x27;s masterclass performance in Tuesday&#x27;s Game 5 against the Los Angeles Clippers provided insurmountable evidence that his game is built for the biggest moments.
Murray dropped 43 points on 26 shots, adding three steals, seven assists, and five boards—according to Basketball Reference&#x27;s holistic game-score stat, his second-best postseason performance ever—and was comfortably the best player on the floor, as James Harden and Nikola Jokic neutralized each other, Kawhi Leonard was Fine, and Ivica Zubac had a good game on his government-mandated supply of six-foot half-hooks and putbacks. Everyone seemed, if not nervous, then exhausted from the mental and physical strain of the series, a conference-final wolf in first-rounder&#x27;s clothing.</span>

                              <span>If—if!—one wanted to identify a trend, one might point out the successive results in the Maple Leafs–Senators series. In Game 1 the Leafs dominated. Games 2 and 3 required overtime to settle, with Toronto winning both. Game 4 also went to prolongation, this time with Ottawa finally breaking through. Tuesday night&#x27;s Game 5 was a mostly comfortable 4-0 Sens win. Using my elite pattern recognition, honed by millions of years of evolution, I could note that the Senators have played increasingly well in each game, and the Maple Leafs increasingly worse. Ottawa&#x27;s scoring by game is a line trending only up, while Toronto&#x27;s veers dirtward.
And if—if!!!—I chose to retreat to my mind palace to catalog and cite past events for the purposes of providing context for this series, I might reflect upon the fact that the Maple Leafs have a history of choking to death, especially in the first round, often against objectively less talented teams that nonetheless stop fearing them as the series moves along and the Leafs fail to clinch when the opportunity is available. Why, I might even observe that their core is 1-13 in series-clinching games, and 0-6 at home. I&#x27;m not saying any of this means the Leafs are gonna blow it again! I am not saying that. I&#x27;m just noticing things.</span>

                              <span>Dads can be embarrassing. The flashlight on their smart phone is always on for no reason, they put way too much effort into creating a rapport with waitstaff, and they are always nearly getting themselves killed by Giannis Antetokounmpo on national television.
As far as we know, only that last one applies to Tyrese Haliburton&#x27;s father, who managed to turn himself into the big storyline of last night&#x27;s Game 5 clash between the Bucks and Pacers, which ended in a series-clinching win for Indiana following a horrendous collapse by Milwaukee. Let&#x27;s run through the collapse before we get to the dad content.</span>

                              <span>With the removal of the away goals rule, Champions League match-ups have tended towards more open play and riskier attacks in search of goals, particularly in the first legs. It makes sense. Without away goals hanging on the home team&#x27;s head, it can push forward more often, knowing that giving up a goal is merely bad instead of potentially catastrophic. With that in mind, though, the first leg of the first semifinal, the one between Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain, felt more like a match from the away goals era.
In part this is because of the lateness of this tie in the competition. It is only natural for both clubs to play conservatively, not wanting to fall right on the doorstep of the final (this is also why most, though not all, Champions League finals tend to be a bit underwhelming as actual matches), and so the order of the day for both the host Gunners and the visiting Parisians appeared to be safety. The other reason, however, is that PSG scored its first half-chance on a day of half-chances, a goal that immediately changed the complexion of the whole tie just four minutes in, and one that showed the difference between the two sides, particularly in attack.</span>

                              <span>Madyson Miller&#x27;s Florida childhood was almost like a crash course in marine biology. She grew up going to the beach and going with her grandparents to see Shamu—&quot;which I obviously realize now is not the kind of value system I have when it comes to animal care,&quot; Miller caveats. But she wasn&#x27;t sure if she wanted to pursue science—she dreamed of being on Broadway—until a teacher told her she had what it takes.
Miller, a first-generation college student, initially struggled in university. &quot;I was a terrible test-taker, and my first year my grades just were not great,&quot; she said. &quot;I really thought, like, I&#x27;m not going to be able to do this.&quot; But then a professor offered Miller the chance to work in her lab studying the environmental DNA—genetic material shed by animals in their environment—of creatures like lionfish and salamanders. This experience in the lab cemented Miller&#x27;s passion for biology, as well as her confidence that she could make it in the field.</span>

                              <span>Todd Golden smiled as the orange and blue confetti fell around him. He had accomplished what no Florida Gators men&#x27;s basketball coach had in nearly two decades—a national championship—bringing a title home to a university and a fan base desperate for a win. (The last national championship for Florida in football or basketball came in 2008, just a year after Apple announced the iPhone.) All those years of disappointment later, the scene played out exactly as it was supposed to. Florida players hugged and cried. Fans screamed. The marching band blasted the university fight song. Play-by-play broadcaster Ian Eagle called out on the TV broadcast a slight twist on the phrase every Florida student learns, &quot;It&#x27;s a great day to be a Gator!&quot;
And it was. The streets of Gainesville filled with jubilant students. The university&#x27;s social media accounts boasted and bragged. Alumni young and old swelled with pride. All the years of losing, of coming up short, of watching other schools hoist trophies was swept away—as was any public memory of the two investigations involving two Florida basketball coaches: head coach Golden and one of his assistants, Gators legend Taurean Green.</span>

                              <span>Curzio Malaparte was the shape-shifting Zelig of the catastrophe of Italian fascism, a political and social operator of such profound equivocation that in his writings he seems almost to convince even himself of his own sincerity. In Maurizio Serra’s comprehensive biography, first published in Italian in 2011 and now available in English from New York Review Books, we follow Malaparte’s skittering movements across a century to which he seems uniquely suited and yet, near daily, increasingly familiar to our own. 
Best known for his nightmarish 1944 novel of the Second World War, Kaputt, Malaparte—a novelist, journalist, playwright, diplomat, and filmmaker—wrote like a cross between Ernst Jünger and Thomas Pynchon, and lived like a daredevil prince. He was forever on the move, forever aggrieved, forever on the verge of world fame, even immortality, or, at the very least, slipping through whatever net was closing around him. He began his adult life as a fascist and became a communist in his later years (a conversion he seemed to think was more a shift of emphasis—his first book, 1931’s Coup d’Etat: The Technique of Revolution, argued that it was Mussolini’s own youthful Marxism that had made him such an effective revolutionary), before embracing Catholicism on his deathbed in 1957.</span>

The Rockies had two men on, and Atlanta&#x27;s Bryce Elder threw a big fat cement-mixer of a slider, and Goodman put some mighty wood to it. Rockies play-by-play guy Drew Goodman (unrelated) couldn&#x27;t immediately accept that something had happened to cause the home team to have more runs than the opposition. Here is the proof:

                              <span>One reason the NBA Playoffs are great is that the postseason&#x27;s competitive structure and tactical complexity make something like the Buddy Hield Game not only possible, but necessary.
The Golden State Warriors won a thriller in San Francisco on Monday night to take a 3–1 lead in their first-round series against the offensively inept and defensively murderous Houston Rockets, and they did so despite a straight-up bad game from Steph Curry. Watch any of the first three games from this series, and consider the state of Jimmy Butler&#x27;s ass, and you would come to the logical conclusion that the Warriors were not set up to win any less-than-stellar Curry game, let alone a game in which Fred VanVleet made eight three-pointers. Unless Curry is forcing double-teams and bending Houston&#x27;s strong, flexible defensive structure, Golden State&#x27;s offense is largely incapable of making the Rockets sweat. Draymond Green, once and occasionally still a good passer, has been excised from the attack, and on Monday, Curry didn&#x27;t have it.</span>

                              <span>Anything I say about “Magnetic,” the lead single off TV On The Radio frontman Tunde Adebimpe’s first solo album, Thee Black Boltz, won’t live up to hearing it for the first time. Go listen to it. Better yet, go watch the video. It’s super simple. It’s black and white and it’s basically just Adebimpe shouting this perfect song into his mic all in black—those muscles, that bleached hair—and a woman (dancer Brooke Shepherd) in white bouncing and flailing around a massive amp with her supernaturally long arms clapping, thighs pumping, dreads flying. It’s the perfect dance, whatever it is, for this perfect music, whatever it is. Every time it ends, I have the impulse to turn it right back on again. It feels like life. Or like life’s supposed to feel. “I was thinkin&#x27; &#x27;bout my time in space/I was thinkin&#x27; &#x27;bout the human race/In the age of tenderness and rage/Had me kickin&#x27; through the end of days.” If you’re not writing this as the opening to your opening song, why’re you even bothering?
My favorite part, right before the chorus, right after Adebimpe sings, “We’re gonna crash your matrix/And how you gonna feel about that?&quot; has him following up with: “Why you wanna come like that”—and then a big, long pause—“for.” The chorus goes nuts. “Magnetic” is a great representative for this entire album, which gives space to whatever it wants.</span>

The value was easy to see; there are only so many Major League Baseball franchises and they&#x27;re not making new ones at the moment, which makes this both a good business to be in and one that doesn&#x27;t do much to discourage the sort of laziness that led to those unaddressed mold/skunk issues under previous ownership. It is more difficult and more persistently demanding to be a smart baseball organization than a stupid one, and far more cost-effective in the long run, but from an owner&#x27;s perspective it doesn&#x27;t really make much of a difference. Smart teams win and dumb teams mostly don&#x27;t, but owners do fine either way; the family that spent the better part of two decades making the Mets as mediocre and repellent as they could possibly be banked $2 billion in profit from the sale of the property they&#x27;d desecrated.
That sour mediocrity was the result not of a lack of effort, but of a heroic surplus of the worst and wrongest kinds of effort; neglect would have been a marked improvement upon the sort of toxic attention the owners lavished upon the organization. It wasn&#x27;t that the Wilpons didn&#x27;t want to win; they did, but only if it meant that the dumb things they cared about—a crabbed half-ideology devoted to various antique and idiotic rules and hierarchies, except when and where it was dictated by patronage or some salty executive whim—to be winning things, when they were not.</span>

                              <span>LeBron James failed to score a point in the fourth quarter of Game 4 of the Western Conference first-round series between his Lakers and the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Wolves erased a 12-point third-quarter deficit and won the game by a single bucket; with the victory they pulled into a 3–1 series lead over the higher-seeded Lakers, who are now a loss away from elimination. Worse, perhaps, than James&#x27;s failure to score was Los Angeles&#x27;s difficulty even getting him opportunities: The NBA&#x27;s all-time leading scorer—fresh off a regular season in which he averaged 24.4 points per game on an outrageous 64 percent true shooting—attempted just two field goals in the fourth quarter of the most important game of his team&#x27;s season. This, in technical terms, just ain&#x27;t right.

                              <span>When you listen to a game on the radio, all you have is the noise. And in Montreal on Sunday night, stimulated by two dramatic events late in the second period, the Habs&#x27; arena swelled to the point of deafening, with a force that made me believe the home team might really have the power to knock out the No. 1 seed in the East. But after a giddy intermission under the banner of a 2-1 score, Canadiens fans watched—and I listened—helplessly as the prospect of a tied series was ripped away by a ruthless and experienced Washington Capitals group that took the breaks the local boys couldn&#x27;t.
First, the high point. With two minutes to go in the second and the score 1-1, a Capitals player was sent the box for one of several hits on both sides that got punished by the refs throughout a particularly physical game. But this wasn&#x27;t just any player: This was the Greatest Goal Scorer Of All Time™, Alexander Ovechkin, who took the two for interference by trucking Jake Evans at the edge of the Caps&#x27; attacking zone. The Quebecois screams, shouts, and boos overwhelmed the announcement of the penalty, and for good reason. The newly crowned scoring king entering the sin bin for the first time in almost two months felt like an event in itself—the kind of rare, odd misstep that can doom a favorite in a tricky series.</span>

                              <span>The Milwaukee Bucks got smoked by the Indiana Pacers in Game 4 on their home court, in a loss that felt less like ending a chapter and more like slamming a book shut, incinerating it, and purging the memory of ever having read it. They are now down 3–1 to a team that has proved matchup poison for them even in the best of times; Giannis Antetokounmpo&#x27;s game is stretched as thin as his patience; they have swiftly degraded from a team with a strong identity to a team about nothing, playing yesterday&#x27;s game with yesterday&#x27;s players. Their only other good player just wrecked his leg, they handed their archrival a title in pursuing said good player, and because of that, they have no future. Four years after the Bucks won a championship, things are looking unimaginably bleak in Milwaukee.
Halfway through the first quarter of Sunday&#x27;s Game 4, Damian Lillard burst forward to tap an offensive rebound to the corner, then crumpled and instantly grabbed at the back of his left leg. As of this writing he has not received an official diagnosis, but everyone in the know is reporting that he probably did in his Achilles. With Lillard in the lineup, the Bucks had an essentially even point differential, with his 24.9 points per game being largely canceled out by his inability to even contain anyone with a live dribble. Still, they needed his offensive dynamism in the playoffs, because without him, the offense funnels to Bobby Portis and Kevin Porter Jr., and that&#x27;s if the Bucks are lucky enough not to be dragged into a Kyle Kuzma game. Antetokounmpo is still the best player in this series, but everything he gets is very tough, and Indiana&#x27;s extremely connected defense is never really stressed out by anything he does—again, because his team is butt.</span>

                              <span>If Liverpool wins the Premier League and no one is in the stands to celebrate it, does it count? Well, yes, but there&#x27;s nothing quite like winning the club&#x27;s record-tying 20th first-division title in front of a roaring Anfield crowd, as Liverpool found out on Sunday. Despite getting the Premier League trophy monkey off its back in the COVID-delayed 2019-20 season, Liverpool finished this season, the first after Jürgen Klopp and the first under Arne Slot, in style, shrugging off some cup disappointments with the one trophy that, for this club, means more than any other. Thanks to a comprehensive 5-1 victory over middling Tottenham, Anfield got its long-awaited party on Sunday, and now Liverpool once again sits atop its historic perch as the most successful club in English soccer history.

                              <span>The Winnipeg Jets were the best hockey team in the world, largely because they had the best goalie in the world, until they weren’t and didn’t. They are now facing down the possibility of being the biggest disappointment in the sport, because their goalie has been the biggest disappointment. Again.
Therein lies the problem Jets coach Scott Arniel arose to today: What to do about a three-year trend that plays itself out the same way every time. It&#x27;s Wile E. Coyote sending away to Acme for the same contraption that breaks every time he uses it.</span>

                              <span>The Texas Rangers found an excellent way to lose a baseball game Sunday night. Or, if they didn&#x27;t find it or invent it, they at least deserve recognition for having iterated this delightful method. They were tied at two runs apiece with the San Francisco Giants in the bottom of the ninth inning, in what had been a somewhat choppy and frustrating game for both teams. Heliot Ramos of the Giants squibbed a first-pitch slider from Rangers reliever Luke Jackson; the ball left Ramos&#x27;s bat at 58.7 miles per hour and traveled maybe 50 feet onto the left side of the infield grass. This is not what you want from whoever is leading off a late inning, but to Ramos&#x27;s credit, he at least tore ass up the first-base line, forcing Jackson to attempt a quick and athletic play.
This is where things first went bad. Jackson, whose pitching motion has him falling off the mound toward first base, raced back the other way to field the ball on the move. Ramos was chugging. A wiser fielder might&#x27;ve pocketed this baseball and lived to fight another day. Jackson felt the pressure to make a play. He grabbed the ball bare-handed, rolled his throwing shoulder under his upper body, and almost blindly fired the ball to first, against his momentum and while crashing onto his back. It would&#x27;ve been an incredible, highlight out, except that Jackson&#x27;s throw was really nowhere close, sailing up the field and well out of the reach of first-baseman Jake Burger. The ball bounced at the edge of the outfield and rolled away. Disaster!</span>

Healy is dedicated to the panel format. He spent election season working on a sort of anti-journalism project for the Times, in which the Opinion section, collaborating with professional political consultants, gathered focus groups of what it took to be regular Americans and encouraged them to express their ignorance, confusion, and secondhand beliefs, so that the newspaper could publish them as if they were facts.

                              <span>Give the Kings and Oilers this: Their commitment to never making anything easy has led to some pretty great TV. The games in this first-round series have mostly followed the same basic outline. The Kings nab a multi-goal lead; the Oilers score a couple to get back in it. The moments where the game scripts have differed—why the series is tied 2-2 rather than already decided, in either team&#x27;s favor—have all come in act 3, and have hinged on whether L.A. can close out what it started, or whether Edmonton has enough time left for its furious late-game rallies. Neither is a particularly envious position to be in. But all else being equal, I&#x27;d rather be the team that gets better as games wear on rather than the one that mostly seems to get tired.
The Oilers took Game 4 in Edmonton 4-3 in overtime Sunday night, by—what else?—a multi-goal, third-period comeback. It doesn&#x27;t even get to the extra frame without Quinton Byfield failing to clear the puck and instead turning it over to Evan Bouchard with under a minute left. I&#x27;ll chalk it up to being gassed—heavy legs and low oxygen levels make for bad decisions and worse execution—and Byfield, who&#x27;s going to be a huge star if he&#x27;s not there already, ended up playing a whopping 38 shifts in this one, most among forwards on either team. But fail to clear he did, and Bouchard scored his second unanswered of the period to tie things up.</span>

                              <span>It was a bad weekend for football coaches&#x27; zoomer sons. During the early stages of Shedeur Sanders&#x27;s unexpectedly protracted draft experience, he was faked out by a phone call on Friday from someone pretending to be New Orleans Saints general manager Mickey Loomis. &quot;We&#x27;re going to take you with our next pick right here, man,&quot; the caller said. &quot;But you&#x27;re going to have to wait a little bit longer, man. Sorry about that.&quot; As pranks go, this was mostly confusing; Sanders&#x27;s response to the call was to ask the guests at his draft party, &quot;What does that mean?&quot; While it was just one of many indignities heaped upon Sanders during the draft, the call was inarguably the rudest.
On Sunday, the culprit was identified: Jax Ulbrich, the 21-year-old son of Atlanta Falcons defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich. Presumably the NFL&#x27;s investigation was pretty efficient, because these idiots recorded themselves making the prank call and put it online. Here&#x27;s the call from both sides:</span>

                              <span>In a just world, Tim Hardaway Jr. makes that three-pointer from the corner, and the Detroit Pistons beat the New York Knicks, 96-94. Not, &quot;In a just world, David Guthrie calls that foul,&quot; even though he performed that rarest of mea culpae: the official&#x27;s admission of doctrinal error. This may seem like a needle&#x27;s-eye distinction, but we&#x27;re not here to indulge a rant about bad officiating. If that&#x27;s you, you deserve to drink alone, outside. In a hailstorm. In Scotland.
But we&#x27;re also willing to say that in a just world, Cade Cunningham makes that 14-footer seven seconds earlier, and the Pistons beat the Knicks, 95-94. Not because we care about the Pistons, or for that matter the Knicks. In a good and entertaining series, the team that is behind should always tie the series up to increase the chances of Game 7 Christmas, and Knicks-Pistons is indeed that. That New York survived Sunday, 94-93, and took a 3-1 lead over Detroit is not good, not good at all, because it could make Game 5 on Tuesday the clincher, and there has never been a seven-game series that ends in five that has been worth a damn or remembered as anything special.</span>

                              <span>Former New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick isn&#x27;t one for non-mandatory media appearances, but those with a book to sell don&#x27;t really have a choice. The North Carolina football coach sat down with Tony Dokoupil for a CBS Sunday Morning conversation that started out as routine and then turned agonizing when the interviewer began to ask questions that might actually interest the public.

After the conclusion of Game 4 on Saturday, he shared his thoughts while the ball traveled through the air: &quot;This is gonna be bad.&quot; He was correct. But out of nowhere, his teammate Aaron Gordon arrived to turn an airball into a buzzer-beating dunk, allowing the Denver Nuggets to escape with a 101-99 win that guaranteed at least two more games in an incredible series against the Los Angeles Clippers.

After the first round ended without a team picking Sanders, the gag wrote itself: What about tomorrow? When nobody selected him in the second or third rounds on Friday, and a prank caller interrupted his live-streamed draft party to deliver false hope, it all became a bit sad.
