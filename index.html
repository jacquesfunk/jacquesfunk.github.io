                              <span>The playoffs tend to provide certain reminders about how postseason baseball works. The Yankees, in completing their 4-1 series win over the Cleveland Guardians to advance to the World Series, provided one about the importance of power. Hit 10 home runs in five games, as the Yankees did in this series, and you can overcome all manner of base-running errors, scuffed defensive work, and late-inning meltdowns. Just keep hitting the ball over the fence, and good things will happen for you.
Here&#x27;s another reminder: There is probably no hitter in baseball more terrifying to pitch to in a high-leverage situation than Juan Soto. The Yankees right fielder came to the plate in the top of the 10th inning, with the score tied 2-2, two men on base, and two outs. Soto was looking for a fastball from Hunter Gaddis, and he wasn&#x27;t going to let the at-bat end until he got one. What must it feel like to pitch to a locked-in Juan Soto, who possesses not only all the confidence and power that makes for a great clutch hitter, but one of the games most discerning eyes. I imagine it feels like being asked to chop down a redwood with a hatchet.</span>

                              <span>MINNEAPOLIS — Somehow, this will end, though your guess is as good as mine. In Game 4 on Friday night, the Lynx and Liberty arrived in a familiar place by unfamiliar means. Neither team bothered with the pretense of an early lead or deficit. This time, they played a game that from tip to buzzer felt true to the series: weird, tense, a matter of execution more than scheme. A Jonquel Jones layup and-one to even things up, 80-80, with a minute left, was the 13th tying score of the game. With 18 seconds left, the Lynx searching for a last shot, Bridget Carleton grabbed an offensive rebound and was fouled on the putback attempt. She made two free throws for a 14th and final lead change, 82-80. The WNBA’s two best teams head where they have long seemed destined, to a decisive Game 5 in New York on Sunday night. 
Lynx head coach Cheryl Reeve explained the game’s closeness in terms of “information gathered.” Game 5 will be the ninth time these teams have played each other this season, and the familiarity is starting to show. “Everything is getting harder,” Reeve said. “There’s no secrets at this point.” The teams’ de facto captains, products of the same college program and models of the league’s richness at power forward, pose identical matchup problems to each other. The lead guards can claim crowning moments. Last night, the two starting centers traded threes. Styles make fights, maybe, but never discount the thrill of a pointing Spider-Man series.</span>

&quot;There are a lot of things that people want to learn about you and your policies,&quot; Bret Baier of Fox News said to Vice President Kamala Harris Wednesday. By that point, the interview segment between the Republican TV host and the Democratic nominee was nearly over; moments before, it had devolved into Baier saying &quot;Hezbollah, Hamas, and Houthis&quot; over Harris saying &quot;&#x27;suckers&#x27; and &#x27;losers.&#x27;&quot;</span>

                              <span>At times, Anora comes across like a movie designed to attract the extremely online crowd, much in the same way as Charli XCX&#x27;s Brat, or Greta Gerwig&#x27;s Barbie, or the Safdies&#x27; Uncut Gems all did. It has all of social media&#x27;s favorite thematic elements: sex work, wealth and excess, class commentary, hot people, &quot;bisexual lighting,&quot; Tumblr-baiting images. It&#x27;s hard not to feel a little cynical when a movie so readily, gleefully plays the hits, though perhaps that is the point—the late-millennial/Gen Z cheese to lure in that audience and trap them into its fable about the limits of transactional fantasies.

                              <span>The Saint Louis Chess Club announced Wednesday night that 17-year-old grandmaster Christopher Yoo had been expelled from the U.S. Chess Championships for &quot;gross violations of our Code of Conduct and the U.S, Chess Safe Play Policy&quot; after he crumpled up his scorecard, stormed off, and allegedly &quot;struck a videographer from behind&quot; following his fifth-round loss to Fabiano Caruana. Per local NBC station KSDK, the cops said that Yoo was arrested and charged with fourth-degree assault. They identified the victim as a 24-year-old woman and confirmed that Yoo was released as the case will be dealt with in the juvenile court system.
While Yoo&#x27;s scorecard meltdown was captured on video, no recording of the full incident has been made public from which we can contextualize the somewhat vague verb &quot;struck.&quot; This has prompted some players such as former World Championship challenger Ian Nepomniatchi to wonder whether Yoo getting fully booted from the tournament was an overreaction. That&#x27;s a fair question—though, according to both KSDK and arbiter Chris Bird, Yoo outright punched the videographer, with Bird calling the punch &quot;completely unprovoked, from behind and in no way accidental.&quot; Levon Aronian, currently competing in the championships, said he saw a video of the &quot;awful&quot; punch and called it a &quot;well prepared punch to a completely innocent person.&quot;</span>

I sit here exhausted: glassy eyed, cotton-brained, every synapse a misery. I watched seven consecutive hours of baseball last night, most of them emotionally disastrous to my rooting interests. It kept me up several hours past my usual bedtime, and tossing and turning in much of my ostensible sleep. Today I feel like I got hit by a truck. I feel alive. This is how the postseason should feel.</span>

                              <span>Approaching José Quintana&#x27;s pitching should be relatively straightforward: Do not chase. The man does not throw strikes. Only about 41 percent of his pitches in 2024 have been in the zone, which ranks dead last among all MLB pitchers who threw at least 1500 pitches last season. 
That is just about the most aggravating archetype of pitcher to watch mow through your team&#x27;s lineup, but for all the readied complaints about plate discipline or sloppy hitting, suffering at the hands of Quintana was not a unique experience: Quintana had looked unhittable since late August. Clearly if the advice is, &quot;Please stop chasing,&quot; looking at batters trying to hit against Quintana leads to the conclusion that it&#x27;s not that easy.</span>

                              <span>Gigi Hadid opened the Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show Tuesday night to the pre-chorus of Chappell Roan&#x27;s &quot;Femininomenon.&quot; She sunk into a platform on the stage and the models began their first push down a runway that was once iconic but is now grasping for relevance. It makes some sort of sense that Victoria’s Secret chose this song to frame the return of its fashion show, which is actually just a long ad that the company managed to turn into a weird cultural touchpoint for 20 years.
Chappell Roan is one of the biggest pop stars of the year, and her earworm singles are the perfect kind of good-vibes, girl-power music for corporate advertisements, as long as you don’t listen to the lyrics too closely. Previous versions of the show might have had an artist like her join the Angels on the runway, but there’s no way Chappell Roan would have appeared at this. “Femininomenon” is a queer awakening, and a reminder of what lies on the other side of living for the male gaze, male approval, and male mediocrity. The pre-chorus goes, “I don’t understand why can’t any man / Hit it like / Get it hot/ Make a bitch / It&#x27;s a femme.” In the show, the word “bitch” was muted, which was jarring at first, but in a way also perfectly encapsulated the show&#x27;s toothless attempt at corporate feminism in its bid to recapture the affections of young women across the country.</span>

                              <span>In what has been something of a bait-and-switch experience for us both, Rohan Nadkarni&#x27;s last two visits to the podcast have come during weeks when I was out. Strategically, this is sound, just given that Rohan is effectively a third host whenever he&#x27;s on. But for both him and me, it was kind of a raw deal. Has he had any new sandwiches since last we spoke? Formulated any new opinions about Josh McRoberts? I suppose I could listen to those podcast appearances and learn the answers myself but uh, hold on, sorry. Sorry I have to start a new paragraph right now, it&#x27;s an emergency. Sorry!
Anyway, it was great to finally be reunited with two of my favorite podcast buddies for what turned out to be both a typically goofy and decently sports-heavy episode. It turns out Rohan has a new job, and at the risk of spoiling the episode, he has had some sandwiches lately.</span>

                              <span>The Tampa Bay Rays have no home. Well, actually they have a home but no roof, and as most of us understand the concept, a home without a roof is just an enclosure.
Hurricane Milton, the bastard that it was, tore the aged canvas-and-fiberglass roof off of Tropicana Field, the Soviet bunker–style home of the Rays since they were Devil Rays, and because the Trop is due to be replaced as part of our ongoing national stadium scam, there is no urgency to replace the roof or even necessarily play any more games on the grounds. It’s very much up in the air whether it will or even can be repaired for the 2025 season. As new stadiums usually need three years or so for construction (except for the A&#x27;s, who have needed 19 and still don&#x27;t have a hole in the ground), the Rays could be vagabonds through 2027, if not beyond.</span>

                              <span>Whatever you may feel about the Los Angeles Dodgers on this day, go ahead and feel it. You&#x27;ll just be wrong.
If they annoy you because of the money they spent to win 103 games and counting and get halfway to the World Series—well, their payroll ranks third among the four remaining postseason teams. If they annoy you because they have been pegged as the postseason ratings savior for Major League Baseball—well, ratings stopped mattering the moment the league’s new media contracts were signed. If they annoy you because you&#x27;re sick to death of Shohei Ohtani stan-dom—well, you got us there, although we suspect that no one is actually sick of that. If they annoy you because of their fans, and the volume at which they make their case—well, name a fan base that isn&#x27;t annoying as a basic function of their existence.</span>

I knew it was a woman; I was pretty sure it was a basketball player. For the second time in a week, I saw the appeal of that feeling, and wanted to give the mystery woman credit.</span>

                              <span>Just two weeks after Helene barreled across Florida as a Category 4 hurricane and ripped through five other states, Category 3 Hurricane Milton delivered a devastating follow-up to the Sunshine State. Although Florida is more than familiar with extreme weather events, the back-to-back nature of such powerful storms has strapped the resources of a state that was still reeling from the aftermath of the impact of Hurricane Debby two months ago.
Helene proved the deadlier of the two storms, carrying devastating flooding to western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee and killing more than 200 people. As of Oct. 15, 92 people are still missing in North Carolina. In Florida, Milton ended up sparing a direct hit on Tampa that would have caused catastrophic, lethal flooding damage. Instead, the storm made landfall 70 miles south in Siesta Key, and its aftermath has killed at least 14 people. Milton left more than 3.2 million homes and businesses in the state without power, some of which had been without power since Helene hit.</span>

                              <span>Good news: It&#x27;s been more than 24 hours since the NWSL announced its latest expansion team, and everyone is still talking about it. Bad news: Everyone is still talking about it because they are making fun of it, to the extent that the team has been forced to issue an apology for how it handled its media rollout. 
The people charged with introducing BOS Nation to the world ran into a problem that many organizations do these days, which is that at some point they found themselves in a room with an advertising exec or brand consultant who said something along the lines of, &quot;Why should we be scared to be bold?&quot; These things tend to happen when you hire an advertising agency with an About page that looks like this. As a result, BOS Nation announced itself with a promotional video built around a strained joke about testicles, which included the phrase &quot;goat balls.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Nothing about Tom Brady&#x27;s entrance into the Las Vegas Raiders&#x27; ownership group is funnier than the handwringing about how this new conflict might affect his broadcasting duties with Fox. That one’s simple—it won&#x27;t. Being an owner means he’s forbidden from doing some of the basic stuff that broadcasters do, from being critical of officiating to attending to basic pre-production duties, but Brady’s booth work always seemed like a lucrative way to kill time until this thing came along. If it means that Fox is on the hook for $37.5 million a year of Brady half-arseing his way through Falcons-Broncos, well, Fox hired Brady to be Brady. Breaking down Bo Nix for the Sunday proles was surely never the hook for him. For one thing, the cash was too good for him not to do it. For two, the appeal of the gig was surely diminished by the fact that there’s no way to prove beyond a doubt that you’re the best at it when you&#x27;re stuck musing about why Bo Nix isn&#x27;t.
But there&#x27;s more—much, much more. Brady is not going to rest on his freshly approved ownership percentage (five percent), not by any means. He is coming in to have, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal&#x27;s Vincent Bonsignore, “a much bigger role than people think in the direction of the franchise in all areas on the football side.” That&#x27;s according to the ubiquitous &quot;league source,&quot; which as we know could mean anything from Antonio Brown up to but not including Roger Goodell. It only makes sense that Brady isn&#x27;t just making a passive investment here.</span>

                              <span>The Alabama Crimson Tide are currently 5-1 and ranked No. 7 in the AP poll in Kalen DeBoer&#x27;s first season as head coach, so it&#x27;s hard to say that anything is necessarily &quot;wrong&quot; with this team. On paper, things are just fine, even with the one loss. It&#x27;s not like Bama never lost any games under Nick Saban. And yet, if you spend enough time in their corner of the internet, you&#x27;d think the sky is falling. After a big, tenure-defining win against Kirby Smart&#x27;s Georgia, DeBoer&#x27;s Tide blew it against Vanderbilt, the punching bag of the SEC. How bad was the loss? Beyond the fact that it was Vandy&#x27;s first win against a top-five team in their history, there was the added bonus that it was a top-to-bottom beating in which the Tide never held a lead all game.
It was a bad loss for a program of Alabama&#x27;s stature, made worse by the fact that it was followed up with another stinker in South Carolina. Alabama edged an unranked Gamecocks team by just two points, and looked vulnerable the whole game. In fact, the Tide have spent a lot of time looking vulnerable this year: They spent three quarters struggling against USF before finally pulling away late in the fourth, and even their big win against Georgia featured a heroic second-half comeback by the Bulldogs that turned what should have been a triumphant blowout into an escape.</span>

                              <span>The goalie goal is the holy grail. More than three times as rare in the history of the NHL as a five-goal game, there have been just 18 instances of a goalie scoring, by 15 different goalies. An intentional goalie goal—one where the goalie shoots the puck into an empty net, rather than being credited for being the last player to touch the puck before the other team scores an own goal—has happened just 11 times.

The tough thing about doing crimes with others is that everyone has leverage on everyone else. (As a Scorpio, this is a nightmare scenario for me. I work alone.) And while sometimes the scarcity mindset is a scam, sometimes it’s a fact of life: there is a fixed number of people who can host a single bingo game. Within any suburban enclave there is only so many people who want to buy essential oils. There is a limit to how much petty lawbreaking one cop can pretend not to see without having his palms greased. But where exactly are these limits? We must go to casino night to find out.</span>

                              <span>It is difficult to grasp, from the outside, what Johnny Gaudreau meant to fans of the Columbus Blue Jackets, even in the two short seasons he spent there before he and his brother Matthew were struck and killed by a suspected drunk driver on Aug. 29. Columbus fans are used to their stars leaving: for more money, bigger cities, more competitive franchises. If Gaudreau shocked the rest of the world when he signed with the Blue Jackets, he didn&#x27;t shock Columbusites—he merely became one of them. He embraced them, and they embraced him in return. He wanted to be there. He always will be, in memory, because memory lasts longer than a life.
Tuesday marked the home opener for the Blue Jackets, and the night belonged to Gaudreau. The team revealed a memorial to Gaudreau on the concourse, featuring his used equipment and signs left by fans after his death, which will be there all season. All players on the Blue Jackets and the visiting Panthers wore his No. 13 in warmups. A video package was played on the jumbotron honoring his life. His wife Meredith and their two young kids were invited onto the ice as Gaudreau&#x27;s banner was raised to the rafters.</span>

Judge&#x27;s slump-busting and majestic two-run moonshot over the center-field wall in the bottom of the seventh inning highlighted his New York Yankees&#x27; 6-3 win over the Cleveland Guardians in Game 2 of the ALCS. 
Judge came into Tuesday night’s home game hitting just .133 with only one run batted in, one extra-base hit and zero homers this postseason. “Did he get it?” TBS play-by-play guy Brian Anderson asked as Judge sent a letter-high, 95-mph fastball from Guardians hurler Hunter Gaddis skyward.</span>
