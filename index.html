                              <span>Why does Brian Daboll hate the Irish? 
Among the many failed decisions the soon-to-be-former Giants head coach made on what was a bloody awful Sunday for his home side, none were more noticed than Daboll’s bypassing extra-point kicks in favor of two-point conversions in the fourth quarter—not once, but twice. Daboll kept kicker Jude McAtamney on the sidelines, only to watch poor and poorly supported quarterback Daniel Jones muck things up both times, and see his team lose precious points in a 27-22 loss to the Commanders.</span>

                              <span>For many reasons, the São Paulo Grand Prix is my favorite weekend of any in Formula 1. The track is the best, or at least my favorite, on the ever-more-bloated calendar, and its traditional position towards the end of the season makes it appointment viewing any time there is a semblance of a title race. Throw in the possibility for rain, given that the race almost always takes place in São Paulo&#x27;s wet season, and the stage is often set for chaos, drama, and all-timer performances. The 2024 edition at the Autódromo de Interlagos might end up the most memorable weekend of all, if not for the pure quality on display, then for the sheer chaos that altered the schedule, upended the grid both before and during the race, and left the only man who could have won this race at the top of the podium, and within millimeters of another world title.
Let&#x27;s start with that man, Max Verstappen. While last weekend in Mexico brought out some of Verstappen&#x27;s worst impulses en route to a penalty-aided sixth-place finish that kicked Lando Norris&#x27; title charge and its corresponding narrative into overdrive, Sunday&#x27;s race was Verstappen at his absolute best. That&#x27;s not to say he had a great Sunday altogether; thanks to heavy rain on Saturday, qualifying was postponed to Sunday morning, under still wet conditions. Thanks to poorly timed red flag in the second part of qualifying, Verstappen was mired in 12th place for the start of the race, and a five-grid penalty, due to adding in a new internal combustion engine, pushed him further back to 17th. To make matters worse, Norris nabbed pole position, giving the McLaren driver hope of a not just a big points finish but also the possibility that Verstappen wouldn&#x27;t get many points of his own, shrinking the drivers&#x27; championship gap further.</span>

                              <span>The NFL is becoming weirder with every week. If you doubt that, let us present Saquon Barkley&#x27;s airborne rear end as the first thing you see when he and it sail over your head. It&#x27;s becoming too hard to keep up with all of the concussion-infused nonsense in this league, especially in a week in which two teams with one win on the season triumphed on the same day.
But then, just as your disorientation is threatening to swallow you whole, there are the Las Vegas Raiders. To call them a pillar of stability would be inaccurate, but damn if they aren’t reliable. Their gift for ass-backwardness (hello again, Saquon) is overwhelming, and after a loss on Sunday they defenestrated three of their most prominent offensive coaches—nine months after those coaches were hired, and nine games into the current season.</span>

                              <span>The hurdle only gained the Eagles five more yards, on a drive that ended with a field goal. But it was one of the weirder things you could ever see on a football field; until it happened, it wouldn&#x27;t have even seemed to be on the menu. It will be in Eagles highlight packages forever. Early in the second quarter on Sunday, Saquon Barkley took a pass from Jalen Hurts in the flat. He juked one defender to pick up a first down, then spun away from another. Now with his back to the end zone, Barkley jumped into the air and over Jacksonville Jaguars cornerback Jarrian Jones and landed on his feet. It was a play that had Eagles color commentator Mike Quick screaming. “It was the best play I’ve ever seen,” head coach Nick Sirianni said.
Eagles beat reporter Zach Berman wrote that down the line, this is the play you will first remember from this game. That makes sense, and not just because the play was unique and incredible. When the Eagles honored LeSean McCoy at halftime yesterday, they showed some of his runs in the Blizzard Bowl. Nobody remembered that the Eagles trailed 14-0 in that game, or that they gave up punt and kickoff return touchdowns. They only cared that the Eagles came back to win 34-20, with McCoy rushing for a franchise-record 217 yards. (People tailgating yesterday will probably also remember that Robert De Niro and John Kerry were there.) The Eagles beat the Jaguars on Sunday, although what was once a laugher came down to the wire. Barkley&#x27;s hurdle will be remembered a lot longer than that, and deservingly so.</span>

                              <span>Heidi Clements jolted me out of a glaze-eyed scrolling spiral one night a few months ago. A typical video of hers starts with her bending over toward her camera and then stepping back to reveal her starting point, a bra and pants. Then she builds an outfit while a voiceover shares a funny or heartbreaking or inspiring nugget of wisdom, like &quot;If you don&#x27;t ask for what you want, you probably won&#x27;t get it,&quot; and &quot;You may say you have nothing to wear, I say: just get dressed. Even if you have nowhere to go, just get dressed. Even if you don&#x27;t like how your body feels right now, just get dressed.&quot;
Clements has amazing style. It&#x27;s androgynous and playful, a little punk, a little Stevie, California-easy with a heavy silver chain or a black leather bag. Her arms are covered in tattoos and she has a shaggy haircut I&#x27;ve been trying to learn to cut via internet videos. Her nose is pierced with a silver hoop and she loves a red lip. She&#x27;s an influencer; she has more than 600,000 followers on both TikTok and Instagram and her manager&#x27;s information is in her bio.</span>

                              <span>In the second quarter of their game against the Cowboys, the Atlanta Falcons faced fourth-and-3 from the Dallas 36-yard line. What played out once Kirk Cousins got the ball snapped to him was a pristine example of two interrelated statistical probabilities coming true at the same time. The Cowboys&#x27; pass defense allows the most yards per attempt in the NFL, and had given up the second-highest number of plays of 40 yards or more even before Trevon Diggs tore a muscle in his calf. Falcons wide receiver Darnell Mooney, meanwhile, leads the NFL in receptions of 20 or more yards. As three Cowboys defenders bumbled into each other, with Diggs raising his hands in disbelief, Mooney ran into a pasture of space and sauntered in for an easy touchdown.
That play was one of the many embarrassments suffered by the Cowboys as they lost, 27-21, and fell to 3-5. Their year is less than halfway over and they already have as many losses as they had in each of the past three seasons. The football Mike McCarthy&#x27;s team is playing has him smashing tablets on the sideline, Ezekiel Elliott is only nominally on the team, and they have to play through a brutal schedule without several key players, including possibly Dak Prescott. The NFL&#x27;s highest-paid player hurt his hamstring on a run in the third quarter and was quickly taken out of the game, leaving Cooper Rush to see out the loss. After three losses in a row, things are suddenly looking dire.</span>

                              <span>The first five or so games of an NBA season can only give you so much quantitative data about how the next 77 or so will go—e.g. the Warriors might not be this great without Steph Curry because they have mostly played bad or injured teams; the Nets are not going to remain this competent, as Dennis Schröder will at some point miss a shot—but they are useful as qualitative exercises. Shots will go in or not go in at aberrant rates in the short term, which doesn&#x27;t tell you much, but the processes by which teams generate good shots and prevent their opponents from doing so tell you plenty. Some qualities, then, that the Milwaukee Bucks have shown through five games: unconnected, slow, stinky, creatively adrift, thin, and generally miserable.
The Bucks are 1-5, winners in Philadelphia on the second night of the season and then losers of five straight, with double-digit losses to the Bulls and Nets in there. They lost a heartbreaker to the Cavs on Saturday as Donovan Mitchell nailed a tough game-winner. The vibes are not great: Doc Rivers is all but openly wailing on the sidelines; Giannis Antetokounmpo is sitting through garbage time in a daze; Khris Middleton, who had surgery on both ankles this summer, has not played yet this season; Darvin Ham is on the bench; and the guy he brought with him from L.A., Taurean Prince, is giving quotes like, &quot;I just feel like defensively, our IQ has to go up.&quot; They are currently the biggest disappointment in the NBA, under circumstances that are not altogether that surprising.</span>

                              <span>All the issues that arise from the Ballon d&#x27;Or stem from misaligned expectations. Even after almost 70 years of footballers winning the thing, it&#x27;s still unclear to many what exactly soccer&#x27;s most prestigious individual prize is actually for. Is it meant to go to the single best player in the world? The best player on the best team? Should the winner have scored the most goals? Won the most trophies? How do you weigh club performances with national team ones? Does it even make sense to try to isolate and award an individual in what is an indivisibly collective sport? Is this whole affair so stupid, the criteria so unclear, the voters so random, the concept so flawed, that nobody should even care about it in the first place?
For better and for worse, the answer to all of those questions is &quot;it depends.&quot; Sometimes it&#x27;s easy, when the best player in the world wins literally everything for club and country and there&#x27;s no need for a multifactorial analysis. Other times, as was the case for the men&#x27;s Ballon d&#x27;Or this year, no candidate&#x27;s case is undeniable, and so you&#x27;re forced to wade into the subjectivity muck. It&#x27;s these non-obvious Ballon d&#x27;Or years that bring the controversy, but also make it more interesting by sharpening what exactly the award is getting at. And this year&#x27;s men&#x27;s BdO was one of the most controversial ones ever.</span>

                              <span>Hours after the Philadelphia 76ers lost at home to the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday night, news broke that Sixers star Joel Embiid dislodged Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes in some way during a confrontation in the locker room over a rotten, cynical piece of work Hayes published this past week. That is as determinate of a statement as can be made on the interaction, as the story broke via a series of confusing and contradictory reports that first characterized it as an assault. It doesn&#x27;t seem nearly that severe, but the NBA has confirmed it is investigating the matter.
&quot;We are aware of reports of an incident in the Sixers locker room this evening and are commencing an investigation,&quot; an NBA spokesman said. The public first became aware when Keith Pompey, in the most egregiously out-of-order manner possible, tweeted, &quot;Oh, boy, people will remember the Sixers season for all the wrong reasons. The team just dropped to 1-4 and Joel Embiid assaulted a reporter in the locker room.&quot; In a deleted reply to a fan asking for clarification of what exactly Embiid had done to the unnamed reporter, Pompey said Embiid &quot;punched him.&quot; Twenty minutes later, ESPN&#x27;s Shams Charania confirmed that an &quot;altercation&quot; took place, noting that Embiid took issue with Hayes&#x27;s latest and clarifying, &quot;Embiid shoved the columnist. No punch.&quot; Charania&#x27;s colleague Ramona Shelburne provided the detail that the &quot;shove was to the reporter&#x27;s shoulder.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Welcome to Margin of Error, a politics column from Tom Scocca, editor of the Indignity newsletter, examining the apocalyptic politics and coverage of Campaign 2024.
I voted. That was the one thing I knew I could do. I didn&#x27;t get the &quot;I VOTED&quot; sticker because they were all out of them; it was the last hour of the first day of early voting and the line was out the door of the high school gym when I got there. It looked like they were printing out fresh ballots for each new person, to keep up with the demand, but the man who handed me my ballot was too busy to hear me ask him if the thing that looked like a printer was in fact a printer, and I didn&#x27;t want to break the flow.</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t give out candy, or anything else, on Halloween. Not for reasons of miserliness or whatever; I simply live in a spooky-looking (at night) log cabin at the end of a very long and dark driveway branching off of a winding and hilly forest road in a low-density area. If any trick-or-treaters have visited my home in the seven Halloweens I&#x27;ve lived here, they were very small, dressed very convincingly as squirrels and raccoons, and left without knocking on the door.
I&#x27;ve had occasion, nevertheless, to form Halloween candy opinions and judgments in that time, from taking my own kids trick-or-treating. Raising kids in an area (&quot;neighborhood&quot; would be inappropriate, here; it&#x27;s just a road with some houses alongside) where trick-or-treating basically does not happen, you learn where the good nearby trick-or-treating districts are, and you travel to them. This means that pretty much by definition, for the past seven years my kids have trick-or-treated on Halloween only in places known to be especially good for the practice, where there are lots of decorated houses, lots of costumed trick-or-treaters, and lots of friendly people giving out lots of candy.</span>

                              <span>My fascination with PATCO was pure: I had no reason to go into South Jersey, and so, for a long time, all of those subway stations I passed when walking around Philadelphia were little mythical pockets of alternate existence from which people occasionally emerged. Sure, I could come up with a reason for a day trip to say, Collingswood or Haddonfield, but that hardly felt legitimate enough to forfeit the mystique. Judging by the dress of the people who left the stations, PATCO served commuters; when I eventually rode the PATCO Speedline, it should be to commute.
I&#x27;ll admit, I was appalled when the prospect of a Defector Atlantic City retreat cropped up. But while Atlantic City offered to my colleagues sportsbooks and blackjack and craps and a sense of glamour, it offered me something much less sick in the head: an opportunity to ride a new and mysterious transit line. Once I realized this fact, I was, shall we say, on board.</span>

                              <span>Open up any novel by David Peace and you will find ghosts, and people beset by ghosts. The haunted are almost always from the north of England, except for the ones in post-World War II Tokyo. They are obsessive and prone to paranoia, as the haunted tend to be; their self-destructive streaks are galvanic and inescapable. The worse things get—things always get worse—the hauntings become propulsive, dissociative experiences. It’s fitting that the late Mark Fisher, high priest of Hauntology, was a big fan. “You are not living with the dead. You are living with the living,” Philip Roth wrote in Sabbath’s Theater. Peace’s characters aren’t afforded such merciful clarity. As one of the many disordered minds in 1977 muses repeatedly: 
“This is why people die.
This is why.”
This is why people.</span>

                              <span>Japanese RPGs (JRPGs for short) do a lot of things right, but one thing they are not particularly known for is respecting the player&#x27;s time. Whereas Western AAA games like Horizon: Zero Dawn, Assassin&#x27;s Creed, or even the newer Legend of Zelda entries, pad their runtimes with open-world shenanigans, JRPGs usually earn their 100-plus hour runtimes the old-fashioned way: with a slow pace, lots of cutscenes and dialog, and grinding monsters for experience. At times, playing a JRPG can feel like watching a particularly engaging anime, if during every commercial break had you complete a puzzle or fight a monster before getting back to the show.
Metaphor: ReFantazio (let&#x27;s get this out of the way: the name is dumb) isn&#x27;t immune to this, especially at the beginning. The newest game from Japanese developer Atlus, makers of the Persona series as well as the more hardcore Shin Megami Tensei series, is a bit of a slow burn. Like their breakthrough masterpiece Persona 5 before it, the first couple of hours of Metaphor are an extended tutorial, which in practice boils down to doing scripted fights in between grand cutscenes that lay out the setting.</span>

                              <span>Species around the world are threatened by the illegal wildlife trade, which peddles in wares such as pangolin scales, elephant tusk, rhino horn, and rare woods. Smugglers stow these artifacts, or even the wildlife themselves, inside large shipping containers, which are too expensive and time-consuming to scan with an X-ray. To help sleuth out these objects, scientists at the Belgian nonprofit Anti-persoonsmijnen ontmijnende product ontwikkeling (which roughly translates to Anti-Personnel Landmines Removal Product Development, or APOPO in Flemish) are turning to a rat with an extraordinary sense of smell. Giant African pouched rats have been trained to sniff out landmines in the ground, tuberculosis in mucus samples, and even survivors in disaster zones. Can the eight trained rats of APOPO—Marty, Attenborough, Irwin, Betty, Teddy, Ivory, Ebony, and Fossey—rise to the occasion, and help stave off their neighbors&#x27; endangerment, or even extinction? We sat down with Ivory, who lives in the town of Morogoro in Tanzania, to learn about the smell of poaching, her itty-bitty uniform, and what kind of treats she likes most as a reward; here&#x27;s how she gets it done.

                              <span>Thousands of Dubliners showed up for the city&#x27;s much-anticipated Halloween parade on Thursday evening. They lined the streets from Parnell Street to Christchurch Cathedral, waiting for the promised three-hour parade that would &quot;[transform] Dublin into a lively tapestry of costumes, artistic performances, and cultural festivities.&quot; A likely story. There was no parade, and never was one. 
Would-be revelers started getting suspicious about an hour after the parade was supposed to begin, according to one attendee. The Gardaí, Ireland&#x27;s national police service, tried to disperse the crowds and put out the message on social media that &quot;contrary to information being circulated online, no Halloween parade is scheduled to take place in Dublin city centre this evening or tonight.&quot;</span>

                              <span>What&#x27;s the most upsetting thing you can imagine existing on the internet? How about two videos—one 28 minutes in length, the other 31—each depicting a masked man methodically torturing, and then killing, a teenage girl. The videos, which feature dismemberment via power tool and an eyeball being slit open by an exacto knife, were broadcast live on the dark web to a paying audience of snuff-film enthusiasts.
Relax. You won&#x27;t see any of that in Red Rooms, a French-Canadian psychological thriller directed by Pascal Plante, which does not feature any gore or violence. But it begins with something that is perhaps worse: A thorough description, even more detailed than the one I provided above, of the snuff films at the center of its plot. The descriptions are delivered to a silent courtroom, by a prosecutor who is trying a man named Ludovic Chevalier (Maxwell McCabe-Lokos) for the murder of three teen girls. All three murders were recorded, but the location of the third recording is unknown.</span>
