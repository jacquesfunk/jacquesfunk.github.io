                              <span>The United States Women&#x27;s National Team is currently in Europe to play a pair of friendlies that will thoroughly stretch the meaning of that designation.
First up is a date with England at Wembley, both a homecoming for USWNT coach Emma Hayes and a fascinating opportunity to consider the dynamics of the transatlantic soccer exchange on both the Olympic champions and the European champions. Hayes, of course, made her name managing Chelsea for over a decade, though she got her start coaching in New York, a bit north of where Three Lionesses manager Sarina Wiegman played college soccer. USWNT vets have enjoyed short stints in England, and so many England players have tussled in the NWSL that The Athletic ran a long story with quotes from each payer about how physical and demanding the standard of play was stateside. The game is not exactly a referendum on whose development environment is better, though it does provide an occasion to think seriously about at the state of the best women&#x27;s club league and the second-best as it closes the gap. It&#x27;s also a serious test for both teams with close to their full rosters.</span>

                              <span>I recently stayed at a blandly business-oriented hotel in San Jose in order to celebrate my birthday, drink a tall boy, and watch the Sharks lose. You know this type of hotel. There were white duvet covers, white sheets, beige walls, dark wood for the closet and bathroom doors. There was a nice light under a wall bench to help you find your way to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The soundproofing was good.
There was also, of course, a picture on the wall. There is always a picture on the wall in hotel rooms. It was a photograph and it showed a cement wall and floor belonging to what seemed to be a warehouse building.</span>

                              <span>It is not important how late I stayed up watching Rutgers defeat Notre Dame on Tuesday night, in one of the many Thanksgiving-season college basketball tournaments happening right now. It is sufficient to say that it was late enough that I felt both tired and stupid the next morning, and arrived at my parents&#x27; house the next evening to help with Thanksgiving prep both a little droopy and decently primed for the cascading excesses of this season. Staying up to watch tournaments sponsored by the manufacturers of the orange-shaped chocolate thing my in-laws like, or the early rounds of the Bad Boy Mowers Battle 4 Atlantis, is a kind of gluttony in itself. It&#x27;s less literal than the kind that generally defines Thanksgiving, but it comes from the same place—the instinct, when presented with an abundance of something/anything, to let yourself have a little treat, and then maybe another after that.</span>

Do not set the table without salt and pepper, as if the food you’ve cooked has already been flawlessly seasoned.

                              <span>Trent Green does not have a long acting career. His IMDb page is basically his football career. For example, it lists him as appearing in 11 episodes of NFL On Fox as “Self,” while quarterbacking Washington, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Now Green has a real credit to his name, though he’s still playing himself—Trent Green is in a Hallmark Christmas movie.
Earlier this week, Alex, Kelsey, Sabrina and I discussed Christmas in the Spotlight. That was a Lifetime Christmas movie featuring not-so-thinly veiled versions of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. It was like any other football movie that existed in a world outside the NFL, in that the teams were fake—the Kelce character, Gonzo, played for the Bay Springs Bombers—and the extra-large end zones in the football scenes were proof that the film was made in Canada. But Trent Green’s movie debut features the real Kansas City Chiefs. Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story, which premieres Saturday, is an actual honest-to-God NFL-licensed Hallmark Christmas movie. Score one for Hallmark in the annual contest for made-for-TV Christmas supremacy.</span>

                              <span>Growing up my grandma lived in a small green house that sat under a towering cottonwood tree on the southside of Minneapolis. She had many old things, or at least things that felt old to my young brain: a cast iron fire place that looked like it could forge steel, a massive wooden cabinet TV that hummed and seemed almost radioactive, a whole rainbow&#x27;s worth of colorful mixing bowls that were sturdy enough to survive in the oven.
The bowls are what I remember the most, because I remember the kitchen more vividly than anything else. On holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter, work would start in the narrow galley of a kitchen very early and it would go late, until family arrived, until the very minute everyone sat at the table, through the comabtive games of Uno to decide who would do dishes after no one was foolish enough to eat more.</span>

                              <span>Current Delaware state senator Sarah McBride was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat earlier this month, replacing Lisa Blunt Rochester, who moved to the Senate to replace the retiring Tom Carper. McBride is the first known trans person to serve in the U.S. Congress.
The left wing of the trans community was not that enthused by McBride&#x27;s victory, in part because the representative-elect positioned herself during the campaign as a staunch Israel hawk even as its military continues to inflict apocalyptic conditions on Palestinians in Gaza (including, obviously, our siblings in the queer community). Given her ties to Joe Biden and the aggressively centrist Human Rights Campaign, plenty of trans people (myself included) resisted any framing of McBride&#x27;s election as groundbreaking. In nearly every respect, she is an extremely typical middle-of-the-road politician.</span>

But now—after countless delicious but rice-less meals with millet porridge, mantou, and/or dumplings as the primary carb delivery vessels—you and your older sister are finally let loose upon the city of Qingdao to pick a meal for yourself.
It is 4:30 p.m. on a weekday. You ate so much at the hotel breakfast that lunch was patched up with a snack, but now you are very hungry. It is time for something spicy and ricey. You are armed with Chinese fluency and a working Alipay. But no creature is perfect, and so you are also functionally illiterate.</span>

Wonder how much deferred money they will have to pay Snell, the offseason&#x27;s finest domestic pitching prize, after the club’s current management team is either retired or dead. Speculate in rage about how the Dodgers will invariably get Juan Soto before Christmas and then pick up Roki Sasaki while they&#x27;re standing in the checkout line like he was a damned Almond Joy. Complain to your spleen&#x27;s content about how, if the Dodgers ever keep everyone healthy, they will win 146 games and be awarded the World Series by acclamation after the American League champion declares &quot;screw it&quot; and goes on vacation early. They&#x27;re still doing this world domination thing wrong.
What they should be doing, simply put, is eliminating the middleman. The Dodgers should simply buy Scott Boras.</span>

                              <span>Speaking from experience, buying into symbolism will drive you mad. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve been absolutely certain that a certain gesture definitively means a person is now my enemy. My long-suffering therapist always tries to remind me that there are other potential explanations for most things. But why shouldn’t I believe my own interpretations, especially if my enemies are making themselves known?
I’m convinced my therapist would be eaten alive if they stepped in the neighborhood where today’s episode takes place. We’ve got divorce lore, hot young lawn boys, cryptic Instagram posts, and garden parties. Everyone’s favorite vehicle for flexing on each other is a gigantic bronze sculpture of a fig. Love the fig, hate the fig, pretend indifference to the fig—it’s up to you. But one thing is certain and unavoidable: On this street, there is no such thing as neutrality.</span>

                              <span>BERLIN — When Germans woke up on the morning of Nov. 6th, it felt like déjà vu: Once again the country had been on the edge of its seat following the U.S. presidential elections, with a qualified left-leaning female candidate losing to an erstwhile reality star turned right-wing political icon. And once again, there was the question: What now?
Germany&#x27;s relationship with the U.S. is based on decades of economic ties, shared democratic values, and strategic cooperation on multilateral issues, particularly global security concerns. While a certain anti-Americanism has always persisted in Germany, especially since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, and German public opinion on the United States fluctuates significantly with whoever is president at the time, the majority of Germans consider the U.S. to be a key partner.</span>

                              <span>There was no big Defector-style Professional Women’s Hockey League season preview last year, because I was (shameless plug) a little busy reporting this feature on the league’s formation. But it’s also tough to preview an inaugural season. Ideally the preview writer is offering special wisdom, honed over many years, manifested in cute and knowing references. How could I do that with a brand-new league? It would have been the blind previewing for the blind—an insult, frankly, to your intelligence. Only now, after one whole year of PWHL fandom, do I feel comfortable sharing a preview with you, valued reader. Let’s see what the league’s second season might have in store. The games start Saturday.
The six teams are listed below in draft order, each entry highlighting a cool veteran and a rookie. If you’re new to watching the PWHL, welcome! At the very end of this preview, there’s an FAQ section with some extra notes, tips, and reminders of the rules. As noted in that FAQ section, the PWHL point system distinguishes between wins in regulation and overtime or shootout wins, so each team’s record is formatted in the following order: regulation win-overtime win-overtime loss-regulation loss.</span>

                              <span>Maybe this is my fault. For years, I&#x27;ve been begging Kendrick Lamar to lighten up a little. To stop with the hip-hop savior complex and the often incoherent political grandstanding. To stop treating music like a college level African-American history course and just enjoy himself. Well, that more or less arrived in 2024: the year of Kendrick Lamar. We&#x27;ve seen him battle and ultimately defeat Drake, put on for the West Coast, and work his way into being this season&#x27;s Super Bowl halftime performer. To commemorate all this success, he has released a new album, GNX, in a surprise drop over the weekend that appropriately sent the internet into hysterics.
In a bit of irony that I&#x27;m sure is not lost on Kendrick, GNX is a party record full of earworms and radio-friendly pop records that, on the surface, more closely resembles something Drake would release than the sweeping artistic statements Kendrick has become known for. It is a victory lap in album form, ostensibly a showcase of Kendrick relaxing and having a good time. But there is something a little too empty about it for comfort. To paraphrase his words in &quot;TV Off,&quot; there&#x27;s a few solid jams on this record but it&#x27;s not enough.</span>

                              <span>As longtime readers of this website would tell you, wildfires hold a certain morbid fascination for the Defector staff. As observers of the ice caps and fans of &quot;going outside&quot; would tell you, the medium and long-term future will both be infernal ones. The more I learn about the theory and practice of wildfire combat, forest management, and the history of megafires, the more fascinated I become. A phenomenon that seems inexorable and fundamentally uncontainable emerges, through the smoke, as a far more subjective problem. This month&#x27;s DRAB selection is a famed nonfiction look at one of the most infamous wildfire disasters in United States history.
Norman Maclean published Young Men and Fire in 1992, 43 years after the Mann Gulch fire killed 13 wildland firefighters. From what I gather, the book begins with the disaster and radiates outward from it in pulses, getting into deeper philosophical territory yet holding true to the hub at its center. The New York Times review both refers to Maclean as a great artist and contains the phrase &quot;cornball pastoral,&quot; which makes the book seem like turf worth mining. It is raining all along the West Coast as I write this and somehow we have avoided a catastrophic fire season for the third year running, which would seem to make a book about a summer occurrence an odd choice for an early winter DRAB selection. Great news there, though: The book also seems to be about the phenomenology of death. &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of tragedy in the universe that has missing parts and comes to no conclusion, including probably the tragedy that awaits you and me,&quot; Maclean, who would die two years before the publication of Young Men and Fire, writes.</span>

                              <span>Wolverhampton Wanderers are a soccer club in sort of the same way that Silvio Dante&#x27;s Bada Bing was an adult entertainment concern; technically it is indeed part of that industry, but the real business all takes place in the offices in the back.
In Wolves&#x27; case, superagent Jorge Mendes is to the club what Tony Soprano was to the Bada Bing. Since Chinese investment group Fosun International bought the club in 2016, the Old Gold has seemed to operate principally as a clearing house for Gestifute, Mendes&#x27;s talent agency. This hasn&#x27;t been the worst fate in the world. After spending about a decade and a half bobbing up and down England&#x27;s top three divisions, with only brief spells in the promised land, the Mendes-puppeted Wolves quickly returned to the Premier League and have established themselves as midtable stalwarts for going on seven seasons now.</span>

Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! Before we get to all the fun stuff, I have a quick recipe if you need ideas for sides on Thursday. For medical reasons, my wife is on a low-histamine, zero-gluten diet (if you ever wanna lose weight, try being allergic to 70 percent of the nation’s food supply), which means that she eats a lot of sweet potatoes. This means that the rest of us in the family eat a lot of sweet potatoes, too. To liven up the proceedings one night, I decided to mash them up and bake them, with some (OK, a lot of) brown sugar sprinkled on top.</span>

If the author of the piece is a particularly gifted stylist, or adept at persuasive writing, you might find yourself needing to spend some time unpacking their arguments and deconstructing their sentences before you can figure out if you are indeed reading some dumb bullshit. Other times, the question is very easy to answer.
Here&#x27;s a tip that will allow you to immediately suss out dumb bullshit whenever and wherever you encounter it: If the phrase &quot;to be sure&quot; appears at the beginning of a sentence anywhere in the text, then it is likely that you have encountered some of the dumbest bullshit ever written.</span>

                              <span>This is the time of year when the best, biggest, and most ambitious movies come out. Not Oscar season, but rather that stretch when the halls of streaming services are decked with the brightly lit, thinly disguised advertisements that are the year&#x27;s new Christmas movies. There are more than 100 new Christmas films to watch this holiday season, and whether that number horrifies or excites you depends upon how much of a freak you are for the festive. Sabrina is proud to say they are a real Christmas freak, and this year they asked some of their colleagues to watch some of the most, uh, available new holiday movies. The second movie in our lineup is Christmas in the Spotlight, Lifetime&#x27;s adaptation of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce&#x27;s real-life romance.
Sabrina Imbler: Thank you so much for joining me in watching what might be the celebrity singer-celebrity athlete Christmas rom-com movie of the season. I came into this movie knowing a lot about Christmas, but relatively little about the real-life stars that inspired this movie. I would love to know how each of you started this journey. What are your relationships to Travis and Taylor and their love connection?</span>

                              <span>The NWSL Championship could not have worked out better for the league. The best team in the league, the Orlando Pride, beat the Washington Spirit, 1-0, in front of a sell-out crowd. Marta, the best women’s player in history, won her first NWSL title while her mother was in attendance for the first time.

                              <span>For everything astonishing about the average Saquon Barkley touchdown run, the most uncanny is how natural it all looks. It is not, of course; on the merits, and even by the absurd standards for this kind of thing that apply in the NFL and basically nowhere else on earth, it just does not really compute to see someone Barkley&#x27;s size moving through space with the speed and precision with which he does those things. But if the particulars don&#x27;t really make sense on their own, the little narrative of Barkley&#x27;s long runs is entirely coherent, just in the sense that they just sort of seem like what would happen when you hand a football to someone who can do all that stuff. They are dazzling to the point of being implausible, but they make sense.
There is a lot of meaningful context on both sides of the ball on all of these runs, and some broader and less meaningful historical context trailing Barkley into the huddle on every play. The Los Angeles Rams talked about bad gap discipline on the 70- and 72-yard rushing touchdowns that Barkley had against them in the second half of Philadelphia&#x27;s 37-20 win on Sunday night, and Coach Sean McVay was forced out into the more literary extremes of coaching syntax—crediting Barkley with &quot;erasing angles&quot; and the like—in giving credit where it was due.
