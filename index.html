I voted. That was the one thing I knew I could do. I didn&#x27;t get the &quot;I VOTED&quot; sticker because they were all out of them; it was the last hour of the first day of early voting and the line was out the door of the high school gym when I got there. It looked like they were printing out fresh ballots for each new person, to keep up with the demand, but the man who handed me my ballot was too busy to hear me ask him if the thing that looked like a printer was in fact a printer, and I didn&#x27;t want to break the flow.</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t give out candy, or anything else, on Halloween. Not for reasons of miserliness or whatever; I simply live in a spooky-looking (at night) log cabin at the end of a very long and dark driveway branching off of a winding and hilly forest road in a low-density area. If any trick-or-treaters have visited my home in the seven Halloweens I&#x27;ve lived here, they were very small, dressed very convincingly as squirrels and raccoons, and left without knocking on the door.
I&#x27;ve had occasion, nevertheless, to form Halloween candy opinions and judgments in that time, from taking my own kids trick-or-treating. Raising kids in an area (&quot;neighborhood&quot; would be inappropriate, here; it&#x27;s just a road with some houses alongside) where trick-or-treating basically does not happen, you learn where the good nearby trick-or-treating districts are, and you travel to them. This means that pretty much by definition, for the past seven years my kids have trick-or-treated on Halloween only in places known to be especially good for the practice, where there are lots of decorated houses, lots of costumed trick-or-treaters, and lots of friendly people giving out lots of candy.</span>

                              <span>My fascination with PATCO was pure: I had no reason to go into South Jersey, and so, for a long time, all of those subway stations I passed when walking around Philadelphia were little mythical pockets of alternate existence from which people occasionally emerged. Sure, I could come up with a reason for a day trip to say, Collingswood or Haddonfield, but that hardly felt legitimate enough to forfeit the mystique. Judging by the dress of the people who left the stations, PATCO served commuters; when I eventually rode the PATCO Speedline, it should be to commute.
I&#x27;ll admit, I was appalled when the prospect of a Defector Atlantic City retreat cropped up. But while Atlantic City offered to my colleagues sportsbooks and blackjack and craps and a sense of glamour, it offered me something much less sick in the head: an opportunity to ride a new and mysterious transit line. Once I realized this fact, I was, shall we say, on board.</span>

                              <span>Open up any novel by David Peace and you will find ghosts, and people beset by ghosts. The haunted are almost always from the north of England, except for the ones in post-World War II Tokyo. They are obsessive and prone to paranoia, as the haunted tend to be; their self-destructive streaks are galvanic and inescapable. The worse things get—things always get worse—the hauntings become propulsive, dissociative experiences. It’s fitting that the late Mark Fisher, high priest of Hauntology, was a big fan. “You are not living with the dead. You are living with the living,” Philip Roth wrote in Sabbath’s Theater. Peace’s characters aren’t afforded such merciful clarity. As one of the many disordered minds in 1977 muses repeatedly: 
“This is why people die.
This is why.”

                              <span>Japanese RPGs (JRPGs for short) do a lot of things right, but one thing they are not particularly known for is respecting the player&#x27;s time. Whereas Western AAA games like Horizon: Zero Dawn, Assassin&#x27;s Creed, or even the newer Legend of Zelda entries, pad their runtimes with open-world shenanigans, JRPGs usually earn their 100-plus hour runtimes the old-fashioned way: with a slow pace, lots of cutscenes and dialog, and grinding monsters for experience. At times, playing a JRPG can feel like watching a particularly engaging anime, if during every commercial break had you complete a puzzle or fight a monster before getting back to the show.
Metaphor: ReFantazio (let&#x27;s get this out of the way: the name is dumb) isn&#x27;t immune to this, especially at the beginning. The newest game from Japanese developer Atlus, makers of the Persona series as well as the more hardcore Shin Megami Tensei series, is a bit of a slow burn. Like their breakthrough masterpiece Persona 5 before it, the first couple of hours of Metaphor are an extended tutorial, which in practice boils down to doing scripted fights in between grand cutscenes that lay out the setting.</span>

                              <span>Species around the world are threatened by the illegal wildlife trade, which peddles in wares such as pangolin scales, elephant tusk, rhino horn, and rare woods. Smugglers stow these artifacts, or even the wildlife themselves, inside large shipping containers, which are too expensive and time-consuming to scan with an X-ray. To help sleuth out these objects, scientists at the Belgian nonprofit Anti-persoonsmijnen ontmijnende product ontwikkeling (which roughly translates to Anti-Personnel Landmines Removal Product Development, or APOPO in Flemish) are turning to a rat with an extraordinary sense of smell. Giant African pouched rats have been trained to sniff out landmines in the ground, tuberculosis in mucus samples, and even survivors in disaster zones. Can the eight trained rats of APOPO—Marty, Attenborough, Irwin, Betty, Teddy, Ivory, Ebony, and Fossey—rise to the occasion, and help stave off their neighbors&#x27; endangerment, or even extinction? We sat down with Ivory, who lives in the town of Morogoro in Tanzania, to learn about the smell of poaching, her itty-bitty uniform, and what kind of treats she likes most as a reward; here&#x27;s how she gets it done.

                              <span>Thousands of Dubliners showed up for the city&#x27;s much-anticipated Halloween parade on Thursday evening. They lined the streets from Parnell Street to Christchurch Cathedral, waiting for the promised three-hour parade that would &quot;[transform] Dublin into a lively tapestry of costumes, artistic performances, and cultural festivities.&quot; A likely story. There was no parade, and never was one. 
Would-be revelers started getting suspicious about an hour after the parade was supposed to begin, according to one attendee. The Gardaí, Ireland&#x27;s national police service, tried to disperse the crowds and put out the message on social media that &quot;contrary to information being circulated online, no Halloween parade is scheduled to take place in Dublin city centre this evening or tonight.&quot;</span>

                              <span>What&#x27;s the most upsetting thing you can imagine existing on the internet? How about two videos—one 28 minutes in length, the other 31—each depicting a masked man methodically torturing, and then killing, a teenage girl. The videos, which feature dismemberment via power tool and an eyeball being slit open by an exacto knife, were broadcast live on the dark web to a paying audience of snuff-film enthusiasts.
Relax. You won&#x27;t see any of that in Red Rooms, a French-Canadian psychological thriller directed by Pascal Plante, which does not feature any gore or violence. But it begins with something that is perhaps worse: A thorough description, even more detailed than the one I provided above, of the snuff films at the center of its plot. The descriptions are delivered to a silent courtroom, by a prosecutor who is trying a man named Ludovic Chevalier (Maxwell McCabe-Lokos) for the murder of three teen girls. All three murders were recorded, but the location of the third recording is unknown.</span>

                              <span>Here is a way to visualize how I feel about the broader state of things most days: Imagine a cooling lake of lava. A thin crust has only just formed over the molten rock below, but it is still very hot; I am going off the 1997 documentary [? remember to check that it is a documentary before publishing] Volcano for this, but I presume it would be very bad to find yourself splashing around in that stuff. Anyway, that is your scene. And then imagine me out there dribbling a basketball. That is how the days are sitting with me of late.</span>

                              <span>On the first play of their Wednesday night national showcase game in Oklahoma City, the San Antonio Spurs ran a lob play designed specifically for Victor Wembanyama. If you are going to begin a game by running a lob for one of the two best shotblockers in the NBA against the other, the most important thing to do is make you sure you drag that guy away from the rim. The Spurs did the right thing, shearing Holmgren from the ballhandler with one screen and impeding his path to the rim with a second, but by the time Jeremy Sochan lofted the pass, it was too late: Holmgren took flight and spiked the ball off the glass, then blocked the follow-up from Sochan. It was an assertion, a warning: More than one guy is pushing basketball forward on this court.</span>

                              <span>The greatest Shohei Ohtani playoff day was his first. That&#x27;s not to dismiss his overall postseason contributions—he had an uneventful World Series, and an amusing stretch of only getting clutch hits, but considering the sample size his numbers pan out as perfectly respectable, if not to expectation. Then again, the expectation was Ohtani&#x27;s typical narrative inevitability. Something like, say, in the very first game of the NLDS, when the Dodgers were down three runs in the second inning, and Ohtani smashed a high fastball from Padres ace Dylan Cease to tie the game in one swing. After six seasons without postseason Ohtani, suddenly there he was.
None of the other postseason days had quite the same feel as the first, due to a combination of Ohtani&#x27;s aforementioned perfectly respectable struggles and the Dodgers&#x27; postseason tendency to win or lose games by large margins. But even when Ohtani wasn&#x27;t getting on base, he had presence. For one, there was that broadcast graphic counting down the batters until he would arrive at the plate. Then there was the shoulder injury scare. And because Ohtani is Ohtani, even his failures had import. In the fifth inning of the Dodgers&#x27; series-clinching Game 5, Gerrit Cole struck out Ohtani&#x27;s fellow 80 FV prospect Gavin Lux with the bases loaded. Fine: It&#x27;s Gavin Lux. But then Cole struck out Ohtani, and that meant something. It&#x27;s a simple truism—big players make big moments feel bigger—but, well, there you have it.</span>

You! You’re a football fan. You have a team. Your team has a head coach, and you’re not entirely certain if your coach knows what the fuck they’re doing, or if they’re just a clueless asshat. How do you tell? Do you wait out the length of the coach’s contract and see if there’s a Super Bowl win along the way?

                              <span>Bronny James scored his first NBA basket Wednesday night. The cosmic scriptwriters, working within the boundaries imposed by Bronny&#x27;s limitations as a basketball player, did their best. It was never going to be a significant bucket in the story of a basketball game, because Bronny isn&#x27;t very good and the Lakers are, or certainly intend to be. The setting was nice, though: The bucket came in the fourth quarter of a road game against Bronny&#x27;s hometown Cavaliers, in the only visit his Lakers will make to Cleveland this regular season. It so happened that the Lakers, off to an otherwise encouraging 3–1 start under new head coach and dynamic podcaster J.J. Redick, were in the process of getting comprehensively pantsed by the home team, leaving Bronny to handle the bad kind of mop-up duties. 
Bronny checked into the game with just over five minutes left in the fourth quarter, to a loud &quot;Bron-ny&quot; chant from welcoming Cavs fans, who by that point had been calling for him on and off for about three straight minutes of game action. The buzz continued, crescendoing whenever Bronny touched the ball over the next few Lakers possessions. Then, with about 2:15 left on the clock, Bronny pushed the ball down to the Cleveland baseline, retreated a few steps, jabbed as if to use a screen toward the middle of the court, and pulled up for a contested mid-ranger. The noise in the arena suggested a playoff game, including a huge pop when the shot fell.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s nice to have a whole roll call&#x27;s worth of names for a home run. We talk about them a lot, and the slang terms come in handy if you&#x27;re someone like me who hates using the same word over and over. Particularly in this World Series, which the Dodgers wrapped triumphantly on Wednesday night, all of those synonyms were put to good use in each game.
To wit: In Game 1, Freddie Freeman&#x27;s walk-off big fly made him an instant legend. In Game 2, L.A. won on the strength of a tater from Tommy Edman, a bomb from Teoscar Hernández, and a round-tripper from Freeman. In Game 3, the difference-maker once more was a Freeman dong. In Game 4, the Yankees got a morale boost from an Anthony Volpe grand salami. And in Game 5, New York was off and running early thanks to a jack from Aaron Judge, a blast from Jazz Chisholm, and a Giancarlo Stanton pancake to right. Pancake&#x27;s not even a real word for a homer, but it works, right? Anything violent and/or tasty will do.</span>

                              <span>In the last season in which the Los Angeles Dodgers did not make the playoffs, Barack Obama had not yet been re-elected. They were still pretty good in 2012, which was Andre Ethier&#x27;s last good season, Chad Billingsley&#x27;s last healthy one, and Kenley Jansen&#x27;s first as a full-time closer. They improved from 86 to 92 wins in 2013 and have not been below 91 wins or out of the playoffs in any full season since. They won just one World Series in that stretch, and it was both fully earned—the Dodgers had an absurd .712 winning percentage when they won the version of the World Series that ended the plague-warped mini-season of 2020—and somehow not really an outlier. The Dodgers won 111 games in 2022, for an equally absurd .715 winning percentage, and that team didn&#x27;t survive the NLDS. The Phillies team that made it through to the World Series that year won 87.
It doesn&#x27;t feel quite right to say that the Dodgers were cheated out of World Series wins during any of those years, with the possible exception of the semi-year in which they actually won it. They have been in the postseason for nearly a decade and a half, and have during that time become the model organization in the sport—as astute and farsighted as the most financially optimized franchises, as detail-oriented and forward-thinking as the most development-oriented, richer and more ambitious than just about any other team in the sport, and exactly as cynical as everyone else. It would have been strange if the Dodgers didn&#x27;t win a World Series somewhere in there, although it wouldn&#x27;t have felt quite right—it wouldn&#x27;t have been appropriately October-coded or appropriately Dodgers—if it wasn&#x27;t a little stupid when it finally happened.</span>

Kelsey McKinney: You are so right. No one is asking about #AgeGapAutumn! There’s so much to get into here. I feel just like the structure of this book (two perspectives in my brain running rapidly in opposite directions) trying to think about it.</span>

                              <span>On Saturday, Colorado won its sixth game of the season against Cincinnati, 34-23. This is notable because it officially makes the team bowl eligible for the first time since 2020 and only the third time since 2007. It is also notable because Sanders&#x27;s method—despite the turnover both by Deion and because of Deion—is working.

Who is that guy, indeed. Was Wade a Frasier superfan brought in to celebrate the lifetime achievements of Kelsey Grammer? Was it perhaps a monument to Matrix-era Laurence Fishburne? In time, scholars were able to discern the artists&#x27; intent: to commemorate Wade&#x27;s classic &quot;This is my house&quot; celebration atop a courtside table after a double-overtime game-winner over the Bulls in March 2009.
The statue&#x27;s posture and garments are mostly true to that iconic Wade moment—he was wearing the El Heat jersey the night of the game-winner, though that&#x27;s within the bounds of artistic license. The face, less so. That bold massif of a jawline is disorienting when viewed straight on, but it&#x27;s somewhat more Wade-like when seen from other vantage points. In any case, it was red meat for the Inside the NBA crew on Tuesday&#x27;s broadcast. Kenny Smith insisted that it looked like Wade, just &quot;making an animated face.&quot;</span>

                              <span>In early October, ugly and mysterious posters began popping up around New York City, declaring that a Timothée Chalamet lookalike competition would be taking place on Oct. 27 at 1 p.m. by the Washington Square Arch. A QR code on the posters linked to an event hosted by Partiful, a digital invitation platform which the New York Times has described as “vibey and very Gen-Z coded.” On the morning of the competition, there were well over 2,500 RSVPs on the invitation.
When we decided last week that we were going to the competition, we had a feeling it would bring out all the usual suspects.

                              <span>A thing about Yankees fans is that they share a single, metaphysical consciousness. This Highlander-type immortal marches in both the Columbus Day and Dominican Day parades, thinks it&#x27;s a bargain to drink so many $11 Coronas at Stan&#x27;s before a game that he never makes it through the gates, and has really strong opinions about congestion pricing. Jeffrey Maier grew up, spiritually, to become every single person in this GIF. And all those guys combined, Voltron-style, to become the dude who tried to rip Mookie Betts&#x27;s glove off Tuesday night.

                              <span>After four games the World Series has given fans everything they could want except for the two things everyone said they would get—fireworks provided by the currently one-armed Shohei Ohtani and the Ghost Of Aaron Judge.
In seeking a unifying theme for what was touted as a cataclysmic collision of styles, coasts, reputations, and economics, the Series has taken … well, not a turn really as much as a slight veer. Even after Tuesday&#x27;s 11-4 victory by the New York Yankees, the series still seems beyond dramaturgy&#x27;s reach. A 3-1 series lead is more full of waiting than proper suspense, and so there’s only so much to anticipate. Unless, of course, Freddie Freeman has three more homers in him and the Yankees continue to struggle in their quest to run counterclockwise without incident.</span>

                              <span>I interviewed Jerrod Mustaf in 2003. At the time, he was launching a basketball minor league called the Street Basketball Association. I asked Mustaf, a former first-round pick of the New York Knicks whose own playing career ended years earlier after he was tied to an Arizona homicide, if he thought his past would hamper his chances at getting back into the game in any meaningful way.
“The jury’s still out,” he told me.</span>

                              <span>John L. Young called it the Million Dollar Pier, because he said it cost a million dollars to build. That was a lot of money at the time, and so very much something that John L. Young would say. The former lifeguard had been a showman on the Atlantic City boardwalk at various locations, and in 1906 opened his showpiece amusement pier in what was then an up-and-coming New Jersey resort city.
“His twice-daily, deep-sea net hauls were famous, attracting thousands of wide-eyed tourists,” Nelson Johnson writes in Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times And Corruption of Atlantic City. “Wearing knickers, an old sweater and cap, he was a wiry and weathered, red-faced man with sparkling blue eyes, reminiscent of a leprechaun. As he lowered the net to the floor of the pier, Young went into his routine of identifying the sea animals he had caught. It was an animated performance that mesmerized his customers.”</span>

                              <span>In the long and storied history of Barcelona, this past week hardly rates as one of its best. This is a club that has won 27 La Liga trophies, five Champions Leagues, a sextuple, you name it. Two wins in four days is great, and doubly so when considering the opposition, but it&#x27;s still only October, and there are no ticker-tape parades under the Arc de Triomf in October. Nevertheless, Barcelona really needed this exact week, with these exact results, in its efforts to shake off the doldrums that have haunted it in its post–Lionel Messi haze, and at last inaugurate a new era worthy of the best of the old ones.
The week from heaven started in the Champions League on Oct. 23. Barcelona had started this newly formatted tournament with a wet fart, losing 2-1 to Monaco in the opener after Eric García got himself sent off in the 10th minute. Though a 5-0 drubbing of Swiss side Young Boys followed, the level of the opposition meant the match was more or less useless in determining what the ceiling of first-year manager Hansi Flick&#x27;s new-look, refreshed, but still unproven side was going to be. The first serious test came last Wednesday at the hands of Bayern Munich, and it&#x27;s safe to say Barcelona aced it.</span>

                              <span>Before last week, I had a grand total of two gambling/casino experiences to my name, and they were both embarrassing and terrible. There was the time when I completely screwed up a free-money loophole on a betting app and had to sweat out a bunch of stupid college basketball games, and there was the time I went to a wedding in Aurora, Ill. and smashed a beer bottle during a too-enthusiastic swing on a Golden Tee machine.
So when I first heard that Defector was going to Atlantic City for its fall meetings, I was nervous and determined to spend my leisure money only on candy and pinball. I had confidence that I wouldn&#x27;t be tempted to gamble, but I knew casinos and their ilk were dens of trickery, structured to trap you into semi-consciously giving them whole wads of cash. I didn&#x27;t love our odds as a company of surviving the week.</span>

                              <span>Last Friday, Washington Post publisher and CEO Will Lewis announced in an editorial published on the paper&#x27;s website that the Post&#x27;s editorial board would not be endorsing a candidate in the 2024 presidential election, as it has traditionally done. 
The backlash to this decision arrived swiftly and from all directions, thanks largely to reporting from NPR&#x27;s David Folkenflik, who revealed that the editorial board had in fact drafted an endorsement of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris earlier this month. According to Folkenflik&#x27;s reporting, the paper&#x27;s billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, reviewed a draft of the endorsement before Lewis announced that the Post would not be endorsing a candidate this year. Some Post staffers, faced with their publication&#x27;s owner meddling in editorial decisions, revolted. A few published articles criticizing management&#x27;s decision to nix the endorsement, while others submitted letters of resignation. A much bigger and more damaging reaction came from outside the paper: According to Folkenflik, at least 200,000 people have cancelled their digital subscriptions to the Post since the publication of Lewis&#x27;s editorial, a number that represents roughly eight percent of the paper&#x27;s paid circulation.</span>

You might see some things, up to and including the richest man alive showing up and capering about behind Trump like a weird child, but fundamentally people go to these events for the same reason that people stand around in Times Square on New Year&#x27;s Eve, which is to wait for and then witness the one big thing that they know will happen. Taken on its own, there&#x27;s nothing much to the jerky descent of a bedazzled ball at midnight, and probably even less to a peevish former president pivoting disconcertingly from side to side before horking up some undigested chunk of reactionary cable-news gristle at mid-size convention center, but also there doesn&#x27;t really have to be.

                              <span>A RAINFOREST, New Jersey — Last week in Atlantic City, amid discussions of business, enterprise, and strategy, nearly half of the Defector staff convened for fine dining at the exclusive, Michelin-snubbed establishment that is the Rainforest Cafe. Sean, Justin, and I had the unique privilege of shepherding Ray into his first-ever Rainforest Cafe experience, which quickly catapulted him into an abyssal state of misery that persisted despite a glass of the Rainforest Cafe house red. But that is not what I am here to discuss. I am here to discuss the creatures.
As soon as I glimpsed the dark tunnel of vines that connects the Rainforest Cafe gift shop to the Rainforest Cafe restaurant, a threshold I had not crossed since my halcyon days, a question began buzzing in my mind: Which rainforest is the Rainforest Cafe supposed to be? Of course, the most obvious candidate would be the Amazon, the world&#x27;s only A-List rainforest. But I also suspected that Rainforest Cafe may be a product of its time and represent not one particular biome, but rather a melange of all rainforests—the high-concept restaurant equivalent of a Coexist decal.</span>

                              <span>No team karmically deserves a championship, though that sentiment is especially true this year. Neither the Dodgers nor the Yankees chalk up kindly on the moral scale of historic suffering, but, on paper, they can make up for it by promising entertainment for the masses: a powerhouse vs. powerhouse match-up laden with stars. What, then, to make of the fact that one of the purported powerhouses not only currently resembles an ant, but one of those types of ant whose primary defense mechanism is literally exploding?
After falling to a 2-0 series deficit to the Dodgers to open the World Series, the Yankees spent their first game at home making their eventual 4-2 loss feel like a blowout. Now, as per the laws of arithmetic, the Yankees are down 3-0. The sweep alarms are going off! The spaceship is steering itself directly into the sun! The Dodgers have continued getting their postseason success from relatively unexpected corners. The &quot;Three Batters Away&quot;-style FOX chyrons for Shohei Ohtani (though also used for other stars, such as Juan Soto and Bryce Harper) weren&#x27;t paying off even before people started making slow-motion videos of Ohtani&#x27;s backpack-wearing range of motion. Then again, the Dodgers haven&#x27;t needed them to. After all: Freddie Freeman.</span>

                              <span>There has rarely been a shortage of drama in this topsy-turvy Formula 1 season, with no truly boring weekends to speak of since the weather turned warm, but Sunday&#x27;s Mexico City Grand Prix stood out, thanks to chaos up and down the grid. It seemed that every lap had a different combination of drivers trying to ram each other off the road, all while sending aggrieved radio messages like they were going out of style. By the end of the 71 laps, almost every driver had a bone to pick with someone, whether that was an opponent, a teammate, or a pit wall.
The 20th race of the season started with Yuki Tsunoda and Alex Albon making contact before the first turn, landing both drivers with a Did Not Finish, and only got sillier from there. Sergio Pérez continued to be down real bad in what surely has to be his last home race on a top team—it has to be, right? Right?—drawing more notice for calling Liam Lawson an idiot after a scuffle on the track. (Lawson also flipped off Pérez on track; the Australian has been really good at pissing off the old guard, following last week&#x27;s entanglement with Fernando Alonso.) Teammates Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc had a frosty post-race moment, as Ferrari had Leclerc hang back during the race in order to not slow Sainz down, only for Lando Norris to take advantage of the reduced pace and pass the Monegasque driver. Ferrari&#x27;s plan worked, but only for Sainz, who won the day, followed by Norris in second. Leclerc couldn&#x27;t fight back against the McLaren and finished third, although with the fastest lap.</span>

                              <span>Manchester United lost at West Ham 2-1 on Sunday. After equalizing in the 81st minute, the visitors conceded a penalty in the second minute of stoppage time, which Jarrod Bowen converted for the winner. The loss dropped the miserable Red Devils to 14th in the Premier League table, with 11 points in nine matches. Only two clubs in the league have scored fewer goals than United&#x27;s measly eight. On Monday the club announced the dismissal of manager Erik ten Hag, which, well, that makes sense.
In 2022-23, his first full season with the club, Ten Hag led the Red Devils to a League Cup title and a return to Champions League qualification; perhaps just as impressively, he ran off Cristiano Ronaldo and seemed to rejuvenate a moribund Marcus Rashford, who scored 30 goals in all competitions. It&#x27;s been a steep and largely uninterrupted fall since then. Last season United plunged to an eighth-place finish, its lowest since the advent of the Premier League, and squandered that UCL berth, finishing dead last in Group A with four points from six matches and even missing out on the Europa League fallback spot. Rashford regressed; Ten Hag picked a stupid fight with winger Jadon Sancho and banished him from the squad; the Brazilian winger Antony, one of Ten Hag&#x27;s flagship additions, performed abysmally on the field while also facing horrifying domestic violence accusations from an ex-girlfriend and two others.</span>

Beating the best team in the division immediately after losing the quarterback they&#x27;re paying $46 million per season—a mega-contract with two more years on it to which the Browns signed Watson after 22 massage therapists had already filed sexual assault lawsuits against him—is a funny result for a rotten organization, although, as befits the Browns, even the triumph was weird and off-putting. They got the full-strength Jameis Winston experience, as the vet threw his team into and nearly out of a big win.
One week ago, Winston seemed unlikely to see the field this season. The Browns demoted him to emergency QB and listed him as inactive before their Week 7 game against the Cincinnati Bengals, only for emergency to strike. Not only did Watson tear his Achilles in that game, but backup Dorian Thompson-Robinson hurt a finger on his throwing hand after playing two godawful quarters in Watson&#x27;s stead. So the Browns activated Winston and became the first team in 16 years to have three different players attempt double-digit passes in the same game. Winston earned the start this week and instantly cut a weird promo before the game, looking directly into the broadcast camera as he touted his &quot;unwavering faith, ultimate belief, depending on the lord.&quot; He echoed similar sentiments in a signature lacrimal pregame hype speech to his team.</span>

                              <span>Now that Manchester United&#x27;s latest ex-coach Erik ten Hag has been finally been deposed as the world&#x27;s meest verslagen piñata (that&#x27;s &quot;most beaten piñata&quot; for our non-Dutch readership), the new leader in the field of hanging from the rafters and swinging tortuously from side to side is Dallas Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy. There is nobody else even close.
It wasn’t so long ago that we had Robert Saleh, Sheldon Keefe, Christie Sides, and Pedro Grifol. All had high-profile jobs and higher-profile stars—Saleh had the New York Jets and Aaron Rodgers, Keefe had the Toronto Maple Leafs and Auston Matthews, Sides had the Indiana Fever and Caitlin Clark, and Grifol had the Chicago White Sox and, uh, Corey Julks, but also this year’s White Sox were an outlier’s outlier, and so deserve mention all the same.</span>

                              <span>We’re celebrating our first full year of Defector crosswords with a slightly different kind of puzzle than you’re used to, a cryptic by Hoang-Kim Vu. Kim works in global public health in Washington, D.C., and is a member of the crossword editing team at Defector and AVCX. His puzzles have appeared in numerous outlets, including the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and USA Today. We’ll be back to our regularly scheduled programming next week, but thanks for solving along. It’s been a fun year of puzzles.
Defector crosswords, launched in partnership with our friends at AVCX, run every Monday. Launched 16 years ago as the house crossword of The Onion, the AVCX not only offers weekly standard crosswords, but also midi puzzles, a cryptic, a themeless offering, and a trivia contest. Like Defector, AVCX is an independent venture with a fresher sensibility than mainstream outlets, and is committed to diversity in its masthead, fair pay to our contributors, and a fiercely progressive streak. And like Defector, the AVCX relies on subscriptions from solvers like you. If you like Defector&#x27;s puzzles, please consider a subscription with the AVCX.</span>

                              <span>A good Hail Mary looks like chaos, and isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not just a matter of having every receiver sprint to the end zone, chucking the ball up, and hoping for the best. A good Hail Mary is a designed play. Everyone has their spot to be in, their role to play. If it still requires a mini-miracle to complete, well, a good Hail Mary is about shaving off the odds by controlling what you can control. And Washington&#x27;s 52-yard touchdown to beat Chicago 18-15 at the buzzer on Sunday was not merely a good Hail Mary; it was flawless. This [football man voice] is how you draw it up.</span>
