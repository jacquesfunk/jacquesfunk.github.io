That year is almost over, and the White Sox are on the cusp of the wrong kind of history, but with three games remaining they may have finally turned up the only lifejacket on their sinking ship of a season.
The Los Angeles Angels are even more depressing.</span>

                              <span>The past Sunday&#x27;s Singapore Grand Prix was a farewell for Daniel Ricciardo, but only in retrospect. Reporters had all but confirmed that Liam Lawson would receive a permanent seat at VCARB and Ricciardo&#x27;s choked up post-race interview seemed to indicate a departure. But neither VCARB, or their owners at Red Bull, had released an official statement. So the day&#x27;s send-offs took on a half-stated tone, none of which stemmed from his team—the commentators couched declarations about Ricciardo&#x27;s final race with &quot;likely&quot; and &quot;may.&quot; Kym Illman, a Formula 1 photographer and fellow Australian, posted a photo mentioning a &quot;last goodbye hug.&quot; Fans voted him Driver of the Day.
VCARB only made the official announcement this Thursday. The outwardly unnecessary four-day delay to the announcement would have been distasteful even for the average driver; that a company of Red Bull&#x27;s profile made such an oversight could be ascribed to the year&#x27;s broadly self-inflicted dysfunction that has plagued the Red Bull higher-ups. An explanation does not change the travesty that Ricciardo, a boisterous fan-favorite, is somehow leaving the sport without similarly boisterous fanfare. Putting aside what respect a 13-year career in F1 may or may not demand in return, Ricciardo was the sort of personality that could bear such ceremony: some build-up, a video, an opportunity for other drivers on the grid to share fond memories or embarrassing stories.</span>

                              <span>CHICAGO — On Tuesday night, the Chicago White Sox had a shot at history, if not the kind any team sets out to make. At 36-120, they were just one loss away from breaking the record for futility since the MLB started scheduling this many games. Late September baseball contests, for two thirds of the league, tend to be either dubious searches for meaning or the barest excuse for drinking beer outside, but this one was played on the precipice of a loserdom that hasn’t been seen since the 19th century, when Cleveland had a 20-134 squad called the Spiders. In the 162-game universe, the White Sox were about to surpass the 1962 New York Mets, who finished their first season of existence at 42-120.
It wasn’t going to happen that night. The White Sox had their first late-inning comeback of the entire season, eking out a 3-2 victory over the visiting Los Angeles Angels. In normal terms, the Angels—at 63-94—are very bad as well. They were also the recipient of most of the home crowd’s scant goodwill on that night. When Angels’ second baseman Jack López hit a home run in the seventh to put L.A. up 2-0, Sox fans cheered him—a little too much. “The bleachers were getting real rowdy and people kept getting escorted out,” a friend who was at the game told me. “It felt like folks were ready to rage.” Earlier, fans had been chanting “sell the team” vigorously enough that the Sox-employed television broadcasters couldn’t really ignore it. When the Sox finished their improbable victory, improving their record when playing from behind after the seventh inning to a hilarious 1-94, the home fans booed them for it.</span>

                              <span>Bun Ito, a master&#x27;s student at Tokyo Metropolitan University and Nagoya University, had begun rearing some Taiwanese tree frogs, greenish yellow amphibians each about the size of a lychee. The frogs, Kurixalus eiffingeri, live in the bamboo and broadleaf forests of Taiwan and parts of Japan, and raise their young in the small pools of water in tree hollows and bamboo stumps called phytotelmata. Ito was interested in the fact that parent frogs fed their tadpoles unfertilized eggs. But he noticed something strange. &quot;I observed that the tadpoles were not defecating,&quot; he wrote in an email.
From the moment a Taiwanese tree frog hatches from an egg to the moment it metamorphoses into an adult frog, between 21 and 43 days later, it eats just like any other species of tadpole. But, unlike other tadpoles, it does not appear to poop. It excretes no solid waste whatsoever until a few days after it reaches adulthood. Ito and Okada recently described the remarkable feat of these tadpoles in the journal Ecology.</span>

                              <span>OAKLAND, Calif. — Adam Curtis would have blushed at how obvious the metaphor was: As a thick stratum of cops and security guards ringed the foul lines, guarding the field and menacing outward toward 46,889 fans in attendance, the Oakland Coliseum PA blared &quot;Celebration&quot; for the last time. It was a final, fitting insult to fans of the Athletics, a team in the AL West that as of today used to play their home games in Oakland. Someone in the building, maybe only one single someone, had cause for celebration—not with the fans but at them.
With the future ripped away by John Fisher and the other owners who voted unanimously for this, what would the final major-league game on Oakland soil be like, I wondered? Would it be a party? A riot? How would the Oakland A&#x27;s, an organization whose stated position to its own fans and the world at large for three years has been, more or less, We do not exist; do not regard us or our product, handle a sold-out crowd? It turns out that a fun funeral is still a funeral, and the energy that A&#x27;s fans brought to the Coliseum served primarily to underscore the irrationality at the heart of the situation. They showed the baseball-watching world what the A&#x27;s meant to them, while Fisher and his organization showed how little that mattered.</span>

                              <span>Things are not going well for New York City Mayor Eric Adams, and they haven&#x27;t been for a while. The criminal charges filed against Adams on Thursday account for only a strand in the web of corruption allegations that has covered his administration. There are many other characters in this saga, including Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Phil Banks, who is no stranger to scandals himself and had his home raided by the FBI this month.
He also doesn&#x27;t know shit about the Knicks! Following today&#x27;s unsealing of the indictment against Adams, Banks was approached on the street and asked for comment by NY1 reporter Kelly Mena. As a graduate of the Fetterman School Of Political Oafs, Banks attempted to defuse the situation by talking about the upcoming Knicks season.</span>

                              <span>One of the highest honors an athlete can achieve, at least in my piddling personal head canon, is the descriptor &quot;relaxing.&quot; It&#x27;s not the only virtue for an athlete to pursue—its total opposite, jarring unpredictability, is also pretty cool—but watching a relaxing athlete can lower your own heart rate. Maybe you don&#x27;t even think they&#x27;ll win the game, but you do know that every gesture is backed by some intent.</span>

                              <span>Broadly speaking, episodes of The Distraction that are just Drew and me talking tend to break down into two different styles. They can be kind of digressive in ways that are personal or just extra loopy, and then there are ones that are ... well, it&#x27;s still a podcast, and it&#x27;s still this particular podcast, but I was going to say &quot;focused.&quot; The idea behind this one was to field a bunch of listener voicemails and do a quick whip-around the sports landscape first, and what it wound up being instead was a decently detailed talk about the NFL, the state of TV color commentary, and the trouble with processing something as unprecedented as Shohei Ohtani&#x27;s most recent unprecedented season. And then eventually we get to the voicemails about cat poop. But it was a pretty thoughtful podcast for a while there!</span>

                              <span>Wednesday night marked the second episode of the 47th season of Survivor—and with it, the end of an all-too-brief era. For a certain member of the chattering class, this season held the sort of promise not seen since Mike White nearly conquered that Fijian beach: a chance to watch a famous writer make a fool of themselves on national television. This year&#x27;s media surrogate was none other than Pod Save America co-host Jon Lovett, a man whose list of former employers includes Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Aaron Sorkin. None of this impressed his tribe, who voted him out at the end of last week&#x27;s premiere episode.
This week&#x27;s elimination was arguably even more of an upset, but still, I found myself largely unmoved, if not bored. Some important context might be needed here: I&#x27;m not a Survivor superfan. I hesitate to even call myself a fan. Until last Wednesday, I&#x27;d watched exactly half of one season while high in an AirBnb in Burlington. If reality television is a spectrum, my tastes trend more towards docusoap (think Real Housewives, Wife Swap, Selling Sunset) than competition-based programming. It most likely comes down to the fact that I fundamentally do not understand the kind of person who would voluntarily spend weeks without running water. But what I do understand is podcasters—specifically the kind of podcaster that Lovett is. He&#x27;s the sort that will say on national television, with an ain&#x27;t-I-a-stinker face, &quot;And now when people ask me what I do, I have to say that I&#x27;m a fucking podcast host.&quot;</span>

                              <span>QUEENS, N.Y. — The final stretch of All Elite Wrestling&#x27;s annual September blowout at Arthur Ashe Stadium, Grand Slam, feels remarkably similar to the back half of the nighttime tennis doubleheaders that run at these grounds for the U.S. Open a few weeks earlier. Like the Open, there is a primetime segment that captures the audience at peak capacity—for AEW, that&#x27;s the live airing of their show Dynamite from 8 to 10 p.m. But also like the U.S. Open, there is a lot left for those who stick around late into the night—a whole other tennis match, or, in AEW&#x27;s case, a taping for one of their other TV obligations that stretches past midnight.
As such, when I leave Arthur Ashe, the atmosphere is different than the feeling leaving any other sports arena I&#x27;ve ever entered. The crowd is no longer a cohesive throng high on a win, crushed by a loss, or simply juiced from the action. It&#x27;s more a collection of individuals thinking, We were the ones who cared enough to stick it out, and Oh god, when am I going to get to sleep?</span>

I am the dad around this house, which means that I am the grillmeister. If my family needs anything grilled to imperfection—chicken, steaks, vegetables, shitty Mission tortillas—I am ready with my grill tongs and a generous amount of Pam. My grill counts as old now and, in grand American tradition, works in ways that only I understand. Only I know where the dead spots on the grate are. Only I know if the Blue Rhino tank is running on empty. And only I know that the two left burners will only ignite if you close the lid and hold down the ignition button until your knuckle cramps. This grill and I are simpatico. Whenever meat is required, we stand ready, together. I love grilling. Every middle aged guy does. It lets you play with fire, it gives you a chance to eat food before serving it, and it gives you an excuse to start drinking.</span>

                              <span>Eric Adams, the very weird, very incompetent, and very shady mayor of New York City, is also now formally accused of being very corrupt. Adams was indicted by a grand jury and is being charged by federal prosecutors with five counts of bribery, wire fraud, and soliciting illegal foreign campaign donations. The news broke Wednesday night and the indictment was unsealed Thursday morning; the full 57-page indictment can be read at the bottom of this blog.
This follows a series of FBI raids, subpoenas and resignations among the mayor&#x27;s confidants and cabinet members for a growing web of investigations that, incredibly, may be about assorted corruptions entirely unrelated to today&#x27;s indictment. Today&#x27;s indictment is mostly about how much Eric Adams allegedly loves Turkey.</span>

                              <span>The sea robin begins its life looking like any other fish: a finned, larval speck drifting in the open ocean. As the sea robin grows, the pectoral fins on either side of its body widen like two unfurling fans—still fins, if a bit extravagant. But eventually the first three rays of each fin separate. They lose their webbing, tapering into slender structures that look remarkably like legs. When adult sea robins settle on the seafloor, where they will spend the rest of their lives, they use these &quot;legs&quot; to walk, stilt-like, the rest of their body hovering a few inches above the sand.
Corey Allard, a cell biologist and electrophysiologist at Harvard University, knew sea robins as the fish his dad and brothers frequently reeled in from the Atlantic. But he did not realize they had legs until he saw them at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. &quot;Never looked that closely, I guess, nor expected a fish to have legs like that,&quot; Allard said.</span>

                              <span>Since the arrival of NIL and the decision that college athletes deserve to be compensated for their work on the field, the NCAA, along with universities, have done everything they can to avoid responsibility for ensuring that compensation is distributed in a fair and orderly fashion. The last few years have constituted a desperate bid to maintain the illusion of amateurism, and in that desperation the NCAA and the schools have turned to boosters, NIL collectives, and corporate sponsors to keep the money flowing. As a result, NIL, while nice in theory, is deeply flawed and about as lawful and orderly as the old wild west.
Many of the problems with the current NIL system are now fully on display thanks to Matthew Sluka, the UNLV transfer who has been the starting quarterback for the Rebels during their hot 3-0 start. The team is expected to compete for the Mountain West title and now, thanks to the 12-team playoff, have a real chance at competing for the group of five slot in the bracket. Sluka, who had spent the four years prior as a dual-threat QB at FCS Holy Cross, claims that he was verbally promised $100,000 by a UNLV assistant coach to transfer over, but has only received a $3,000 relocation stipend. As a result, Sluka announced on Wednesday that he intends to redshirt and will not play for the remainder of the season.</span>

                              <span>This week, some of the most prominent figures in American broadcast news tried to get away with a staggering lie. The story is a particularly instructive case study on the dynamics of the American media&#x27;s failure to accurately cover the ongoing Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza.
On Sept. 12, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced that her office would pursue criminal charges against students and alumni who protested the genocide by setting up an encampment on the University of Michigan&#x27;s main quad. That protest launched on April 22, one day after Palestinian civil defense crews unearthed a mass grave containing 180 bodies at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Yunis. On May 21, university police moved against the protest in the early morning and cleared the encampment, pepper-spraying protestors in the process. Nessel&#x27;s office filed misdemeanor trespassing charges against two of the protesters; the other seven face felony charges for &quot;an additional count of Resisting or Obstructing a Police Officer,&quot; per the DA&#x27;s office, for &quot;making direct contact with the officers&#x27; bodies&quot; while they were being arrested.</span>

This was the correct decision, from his team&#x27;s perspective: Shohei Ohtani was on deck, and Rojas would make an acceptable sacrifice to enable a possible Ohtani walk-off against the Padres. But swing the bat Rojas did, and for that, there were consequences.</span>

Tellez was in Pittsburgh on a one-year contract; in all probability, Tuesday&#x27;s release brings to a close his days with the Pirates. The timing of this otherwise minor transaction is pretty icky: As first noted by Pirates fans on Twitter and then confirmed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Tellez was cut loose at the threshold of a performance bonus written into his incentive-laden contract. Tellez would&#x27;ve earned a $200,000 payout for hitting 425 plate appearances on the season; instead, after this last-minute maneuver, Tellez ends his campaign stuck on 421.
Ben Cherington, Pittsburgh&#x27;s general manager, insists this is an unfortunate but otherwise pure coincidence. &quot;Zero factor in the decision,&quot; Cherington said Tuesday, ahead of a game against the Brewers. &quot;Aware of it, certainly. I’m aware of the contracts that all players have. No factor at all, zero.&quot; According to Cherington and Pirates manager Derek Shelton, the team wants to prioritize giving roster spots to the players who are most likely to factor beyond the end of this shitty, disheartening, last-place season. In related moves, the Pirates released veteran outfielder Michael A. Taylor, also wrapping up a one-year contract, and promoted a pair of minor leaguers into the big club&#x27;s two fresh vacancies. One of these call-ups, 23-year-old Liover Peguero, is a gifted infielder with a somewhat faded prospect profile, the type of youngster that non-contenders traditionally do like to promote in September. The other, 29-year-old outfielder Joshua Palacios, is just a guy. Maybe one or both of them make the Pirates next season; for what it&#x27;s worth, both of them have already seen time with the big club and played their way back to the minors.</span>

                              <span>Rumaan Alam&#x27;s new novel Entitlement begins, as so many New York stories do, on the subway. It’s summer—&quot;strange, sultry&quot;—and the city is being terrorized by a &quot;lunatic at large who was jabbing unsuspecting commuters with a hypodermic needle.&quot; Creatively dubbed the &quot;Subway Pricker,&quot; the anonymous piquerist has already claimed three victims and the imaginations of the city’s denizens. None of this concerns Brooke Orr, who considers &quot;the pricker like Santa Claus or the tooth fairy, real only if you believed him to be.&quot; In fact, other than her new job as a program coordinator at a Manhattan foundation established by a white octogenarian billionaire named Asher Jaffee, very little seems to concern Brooke.
The headlines she reads on the train to work are &quot;anodyne ... the good luck of a boring moment in the world&#x27;s long history, Obama’s placid America.&quot; Entitlement is set in 2014, a year that that might register as anodyne in the nostalgic gaze of its post-pandemic audience, but probably wouldn&#x27;t to a 33-year-old black woman like Brooke. The summer of 2014 was the summer of Ta-Nehisi Coates&#x27;s landmark essay &quot;A Case for Reparations.&quot; It was the summer of the Flint water crisis, the summer of Elliot Rodger, the summer of the Ebola outbreak, the summer of #BringBackOurGirls. It was the same summer where Michael Brown&#x27;s body was left to bake on the hot Missouri pavement for four hours.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard to pin down Lamine Yamal&#x27;s place amongst the top players in the world today. I guess it should be no surprise that a teenager resists fixity, being in that stage of life defined by constant growth and flux.
The difficulty is twofold. On the one hand, you don&#x27;t want the allure of the new to rob you of perspective. How can you call Lamine the best player in the world for what he has done over the past six months, when, for instance, Kylian Mbappé has been doing what he does for the past six years? On the other, you can&#x27;t let your attachment to the past prevent you from accurately assessing the present state of things. Yes, he&#x27;s only 17, and he&#x27;s only been playing like this for the better part of this calendar year. But in that brief time Lamine has already achieved feats within the reach only of the game&#x27;s generational talents. How could you deny that what you routinely see from him, both in Barcelona&#x27;s colors and in Spain&#x27;s, earns him a place in the highest tier of the player hierarchy?</span>

                              <span>I could not help but recall J.K. Trotter&#x27;s charmingly deranged old Gawker blog, &quot;How to Find a Beeping Smoke Detector If You Don&#x27;t Know Where It Is.&quot; His revelatory technique: Once you have not found the smoke detector where you expected to find it, continue looking in other places until you find it. I thought of this as my wife and I hunted a mysterious high-pitched ringing sound around the main floor of our house. Trotter had eventually found the smoke detector beneath the bathroom sink (!), in the back of a cabinet (!!), covered by a bag of sand (???), nowhere near the sound&#x27;s seeming point of origin, a phenomenon he discovered was due to the auditory qualities of the alarm&#x27;s sound and the acoustic properties of his bathroom. (It&#x27;s a good blog!)
It was a sustained, maddening, high-pitched ringing sound, not all that unlike that made by a smoke or carbon monoxide detector when it&#x27;s actually set off. We couldn&#x27;t figure out what was making it; though it sounded vaguely alarm-like, it also clearly was not the sound any of our various alarms make. It seemed to be originating from the bathroom, but like Trotter&#x27;s sound, not from any discernible point in the bathroom.</span>

                              <span>This is baseball&#x27;s version of Holy Week, and because it is a much less regular occurrence than the tawdry religious hoopdeblah of the same name, its emergence should be celebrated by more than just those directly involved.
It is that rarest of rare white elks, a true multiple-team playoff race, and no it does not matter that the race involved is for the much less climactic extra wild card spots, nor that there are four right answers and roughly twice as many quizzers. It is the beauteous chaos of simultaneous events all emanating import into other corners of the world. Or in English, it&#x27;s the Royals, Tigers, Twins, and Mariners all fighting for the two American League wild card spots not already claimed by the Orioles, and the Diamondbacks, Mets, and Braves for the final two National League vacancies. All those teams have their evident flaws and alluring charms and fan bases that simultaneously warm the hearts and irritate the spleens; the winners will all both be considerable underdogs against their first-round opponents and teams with not entirely specious hopes for an improbable run deeper into the fall.</span>

                              <span>Thanks to those of you who joined us for our discussion of In the Freud Archives back in August. Not long after we finished DRAB-ing, I found myself with a free afternoon in Berkeley, and took myself out to the upstairs cafe at Chez Panisse. I left the meal with a 60 percent water, 40 percent roasted fig body composition. I can see why Jeff Masson wanted to dine there. If any of my future interview subjects would like to make plans there, you have my permission. Let’s expense some figs to the company.
This fall, we&#x27;re doing something we never do at Defector Reads A Book. You know us by now: We&#x27;re the sort of book club that skews Beowulf and Moby Dick. In a twist, we&#x27;re reading a book that is not hundreds of years old—one that, in fact, just came out today. A group of Sally Rooney newbies and completists on staff is gathering to chat Intermezzo, the buzzy Irish novelist&#x27;s fourth novel. Could this be the great Marxist chess novel of our time? We&#x27;ll have to ask Patrick.</span>

                              <span>I like their outfield defense, the team’s truest weapon. I like how they turn doubles into outs, and triples into outs, and homers into outs, and pretty soon, that’s 27 outs. They do lots of things I don’t like, but I like them so much, I forgot what those things are.</span>

Kennedy Jr., many of the most powerful people in journalism are asking, rhetorically, Why are people making such a big deal about this? That&#x27;s not a question to be dismissed out of hand simply because other people also happen to be mad at Nuzzi for stupid reasons.
Dead-eyed hacks like Caitlin Flanagan and Chris Cillizza have made their predictable cases, as has former Buzzfeed editor-in-chief and New York Times media columnist Ben Smith. Smith, of Smith &amp; Smith Media, addressed the scandal in a confused edition of his newsletter over the weekend. Against the &quot;full fury of American media prurience and self-righteousness,&quot; Smith&#x27;s defense of Nuzzi is that to draw the ethical line at engaging in a sexual relationship with a reporting subject is arbitrary, and that the work of reporting is inherently compromising:</span>
