                              <span>This is the time of year when the the best, biggest, and most ambitious movies come out. Not Oscar season, but rather that stretch when the halls of streaming services are decked with the brightly lit, thinly disguised advertisements that are the year&#x27;s new Christmas movies. There are more than 100 new Christmas films to watch this holiday season, and whether that number horrifies or excites you depends upon how much of a freak you are for the festive. Sabrina is proud to say they are a real Christmas freak, and this year they asked some of their colleagues to watch some of the most, uh, available new holiday movies. The first movie in our lineup is Hot Frosty, Netflix&#x27;s romance between a human woman and a magical snowman with abs.
Sabrina Imbler: I am very grateful to both of you for taking a chance on this idea and watching perhaps the film of the 2024 Christmas movie season: Hot Frosty. Before we get into it, I wanted to ask if each of you could share more about your relationship to Christmas movies, good and bad. Had either of you heard of Hot Frosty before this?</span>

                              <span>It’s been some time since I’ve taken Robert Zemeckis seriously. His last film to make a lasting impression was 2007’s Beowulf, an unwieldy but compelling action adaptation of the ancient epic poem that, three years after The Polar Express’s ambitious venture into the uncanny valley, proved that Zemeckis was a filmmaker willing to keep pushing past the bounds of good taste. 3D animation was no longer nascent, but his goal was to blend semi-realistic human characters via motion-capture with the elasticity and graphic creativity of 2D cartoons, somewhere beyond the territory of Looney Tunes and The Incredibles but a few stops short of Gollum in Lord of the Rings. If one were to term this a bet, Zemeckis won. Performance capture animation, from the new Planet of the Apes franchise to Into the …</span>

                              <span>Years ago, as a student at the University of the Ryukyus in in Okinawa, Japan, Ai Takahata was researching the color patterns of a seahorse about the size of a shelled peanut. The pygmy seahorse Hippocampus bargibanti lives only on knobbly, branched corals called gorgonian sea-fans, where its own, equally lumpish body is perfectly camouflaged. When Takahata cut off a branch of the seahorse&#x27;s coral, a handful of worms spilled out.
She brought the worms to Chloé Julie Loïs Fourreau, a graduate student in the same lab at the university, who studies worms. &quot;At that time I didn’t even know about this species and wasn’t looking for them,&quot; Fourreau wrote in an email. But when Fourreau looked into the literature, she identified them as Haplosyllis anthogorgicola, a species of polychaete worm that was first described in 1956 and then never recorded again. The researchers had unwittingly rediscovered a long-lost species of a tiny, nearly transparent worm about as long as a green lentil. Their paper on this rediscovery, &quot;The Trojan seahorse,&quot; was published recently in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.</span>

                              <span>At darker moments, contesting this kind of stuff in the wake of the 2024 election—and all the shameless, shameful, unforgivable work the American media did to produce that election&#x27;s outcome—feels as absurd as demanding the cannibal presently eating your legs use a knife and fork. In less dark moments, that contestation feels like just about the only form hope can take. The language still exists. Maybe someone will need it, someday, to accomplish some good in the world, while the world still exists. If that&#x27;s ever to be possible, then our language has to retain some usefulness, too. It has to be tended.
&quot;Trump Picks R.F.K. Jr. to be Head of Health and Human Services Dept.,&quot; reads the New York Times headline from Thursday, atop a story by health policy reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg about, well, pretty much what the headline says. We&#x27;re fine up to that point. Then there&#x27;s the subhed (emphasis mine): &quot;Whether the Senate would confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic who has unorthodox views about medicine, is an open question.&quot; That formulation repeats in the lead paragraph (emphasis again mine):</span>

                              <span>Because Philadelphia sports fans are the irradiated mutants they are, a win by the local team is not necessarily the central point of the exercise. If you’re wondering why the Eagles fan in your life seems grumpy and sour this morning even in victory—that is to say, slightly more hungover but otherwise normal—know that it is mostly because they are an Eagles fan, and also because they are fuming that Saquon Barkley did such yeoman&#x27;s work in saving Jake Elliott&#x27;s job.
Oh, they&#x27;ll open any conversation, whether you asked or not, with their pleasure at the Eagles beating Washington, 26-18, grabbing the NFC East race by its saggy eyelids, and covering the 4.5 en route. But if they bet the over, they will be fuming in their own charmingly unintelligible way about the seven gettable points that Elliott, the team&#x27;s veteran placekicker, could not deliver. And in a division race that now almost surely belongs to the Iggles, those little things count—not some knobhead’s bet, but the worry that your kicker might screw you in real time in December, or worse, January.</span>

                              <span>It can be easy, as a sports fan and a blogger, to focus on the times players and teams screw up. Easy, and satisfying too. And hilarious. Oh man, when a guy really biffs it? Has a total brain-fart and all you can do is laugh and say What the fuck were you thinking? I live for that shit. If they could bottle LeBron yelling at J.R. Smith I would develop a drinking problem. 
I have lost my train of thought. Let me start over. It can be easy to focus on the poor choices made in sports, because they&#x27;re aberrations. But it&#x27;s worth noting the good decisions too—the unsexy choices that won&#x27;t generally make highlight reels but do increase a team&#x27;s chances. We had one such example in Thursday&#x27;s Blues-Sabres game, tied in the final minute of regulation when St. Louis interfered with Buffalo goalie Devon Levi.</span>

                              <span>It is clear what we most need to happen in the sure-to-be-bastardized 2025 baseball season, and that is for the Tampa Bay Rays and West Sacramento Athletics to not only reach the postseason but to fight their way to a match-up in the American League Championship Series. If we&#x27;re doing Major League Baseball at Major League Prices in minor league settings, let&#x27;s not half-ass this. Let&#x27;s really go for it.
The Rays announced yesterday that their 2025 home will be Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, the spring training home of baseball&#x27;s reigning anti-Rays, the New York Yankees; in keeping with America&#x27;s exciting new approach to the redistribution of wealth, the Rays will be paying the Yankees $15 million in rent for the privilege. For big league teams, that amount of money is a rounding error, but as a metaphor—with the poverty-unravaged Yankees getting more financial oomph in their pursuit of Juan Soto while the Rays scramble to re-up Jose Siri—it is exquisite. One team lives the newly-in-vogue shameless patrician&#x27;s life while the other barely gets by on a diet of Montgomery Biscuits and Charleston River Dogs, with the former extracting rent from the latter. It&#x27;s one American pastime embedded in another.</span>

                              <span>There is something bleakly inspiring about the fact that despite the total saturation of sports culture with the brand and business, there appears to be no way to make sports gambling feel like anything but poisonously bad vibes. People are still doing it and sometimes wrecking their lives in the process. The gambling concerns that sit atop the industry are propping up what&#x27;s left of sports media with their advertising expenditures, and bending coverage toward their own cheesy ends. A government that only grudgingly restrains predatory industries like this one, under the best of circumstances, is not remotely under the best of circumstances. None of this appears to be going anywhere, but it is also not getting any less repellent. Sounds like podcast stuff to me!</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t care that he left Sacramento to go to high school in bullshit Southern California, then played in college for the Duke Blue bullshit Devils, or that he now plays for the bullshit Philadelphia 76ers: I love Sacramento native and Sixers point guard Jared McCain.
When he was drafted 16th overall this past spring, many snickered that a little guy who paints his nails and is famous foremost for his TikToks would be playing in Philadelphia, on the theory that he would be a weird cultural fit in a city whose citizenry prides itself on eating rocks and loving pain. That line of thinking misses a key thing that McCain has in him, which is: That Dog. McCain is a hooper&#x27;s hooper, and the main aspect of McCain&#x27;s game that has struck me through the serious hot stretch he&#x27;s enjoying, aside from the discrete basketball skills he&#x27;s showing off, is his ironclad mentality. He&#x27;s operating like he&#x27;s the best player on the court at all times, which I think is as important for young players adjusting to NBA speed as hitting open shots or making rotations. To belong, you have to believe you belong, and if there&#x27;s one thing that makes me optimistic McCain will stick, it&#x27;s his confidence.</span>

You’re in a casino. It’s early in the morning, but it could be any time of day. There are no clocks here. No windows, either. Surrounding you is nothing but the strangely cheery hum of the casino that occupies the main floor of this hotel: bright and colorful screens, verdant felt gaming tables, cartoonish bloops and farts emanating from all of the machines, even the ones not being used. The playlist is solid but also relentless, following you anywhere you walk. You’re one of the few people here right now, but the ambience of the casino doesn’t make it feel that way. The place feels alive, even though it’s only artificially so. Fake life will have to do for now. It’s early and you haven’t had your coffee yet, so you’re not ready to confront reality yet anyway.</span>

                              <span>Disgraced former NFL coach Jon Gruden has spent the last few years desperately trying to return to his craft. Gruden lost his head coaching job with the Las Vegas Raiders in 2021, after emails in which he used racist, homophobic, and sexist language were leaked to the press. In one of those emails, he wrote that &quot;Dumboriss Smith has lips the size of michellin tires,&quot; in reference to then-NFLPA head DeMaurice Smith. Gruden resigned from his position with the Raiders in October 2021, and then popped up the following year, sporting a Mark Davis-lite haircut, to half-heartedly apologize for the things he wrote.
That didn&#x27;t do the trick, so Gruden has spent the last two years coming up with other ideas. He managed to weasel his way into the Kansas City Chiefs&#x27; training camp this past summer, but that didn&#x27;t lead to any jobs. Then he sat down for a profile with CBS Sports in September, in which he revealed that his new goal was to get a job coaching college football. Still, no coaching opportunities materialized, which left Gruden stranded with one final option: content creation.</span>

                              <span>What exactly is the Utah Hockey Club? I can give you the obvious answers: They&#x27;re an NHL team playing its first season in Salt Lake City; they&#x27;re the reanimated corpse of the Arizona Coyotes; they&#x27;re a company that still hasn&#x27;t settled on an name for its product. But none of those mean a whole lot in the context of actually watching a game. To fans of other teams, their presence on the schedule remains abstract and unfamiliar—detached from any memories of past experiences. For those in Utah, they&#x27;re by definition your team, but you don&#x27;t really know the players yet, haven&#x27;t gotten used to the rhythm of week-by-week hot and cold streaks. It&#x27;s like living with a new roommate; you may be open-minded and even optimistic, but there&#x27;s a lot of blank space left to fill.
The Carolina Hurricanes do not have this issue. As they&#x27;ve made the playoffs in six straight years under head coach Rod Brind&#x27;Amour, they&#x27;ve established one of the firmest identities in the NHL. With longtime players like Sebastian Aho, Marty Nečas, Andrei Svechnikov, Jordan Staal, and Jaccob Slavin, you know exactly what you&#x27;re getting when you play the Canes: a team that will do everything they can to maximize shot differential and win by out-possessing their opponents. Utah got the quintessential Canes experience at home on Wednesday night, getting outshot 50-21. But with a statement-making third period that began with fireworks and ended safely in Karel Vejmelka&#x27;s glove, they picked up an unlikely and inspiring 4-1 win.</span>

                              <span>The hits keep coming for Premier League referee and self-proclaimed Liverpool hater David Coote. After the leak of a video showing Coote, possibly if not definitely zooted out of his mind, disparaging Liverpool and Jürgen Klopp, a new video, published by the often unsavory and sometimes downright evil tabloid The Sun, reportedly shows the now-suspended Coote snorting a white powder of some sort—wink wink—while on duty at Euro 2024 this past summer in Germany.
According to Sky Sports, the English soccer referee association (PGMOL for short) is aware of the new video and said in a statement that they are taking the allegations &quot;very seriously.&quot; The spokesperson for the PGMOL goes on to say that &quot;David&#x27;s welfare continues to be of utmost importance to us, and we are committed to providing him with the ongoing necessary support he needs through this period.&quot;</span>

                              <span>For me, seeing a screen in a theater is like seeing a bank logo at Pride. We don’t need that here! This space is about living, breathing, three-dimensional people. And I’m not just talking about the tiny cell-phone screens that light up in the rows around me—though, obviously, put those away. I mean when a Broadway production devotes a chunk of its stage to images of the actors instead of the actors themselves. When I go to the theater, I like to feel myself disappear into the production, and a screen is inherently distancing—a copy of the real thing. Every once in a while, like in Ivo Van Hove’s production of Network, the presence of a screen makes diegetic sense. But mostly, like in Ivo Van Hove’s production of West Side Story, the staging makes you wonder if you should have just gone to an IMAX theater instead—a place where person-to-person empathy is supposed to be subsumed by spectacle. But if any production can make an argument for these screens as experience-enhancers rather than mere shiny toys, it’s Sunset Blvd., the new staging of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, which feels like the trendiest thing to see on Broadway this holiday season.
When the 23-foot LCD screen swung down from the ceiling to magnify Tom Francis’s harried face in the show’s early going, I was a little bit relieved, against my traditionalist instincts. You see, I had one of the worst seats in the house at the St. James Theatre—any farther away and I’d be watching The Hills Of California across the street. And because I was so high up, and could see no details whatsoever of anyone’s face, I appreciated the Jumbotron-esque assistance provided by the compact camera rig Francis held in front of him. But as it kept returning, I was confronted by the inevitable question: Do you look at the real thing, or the larger-than-life thing? It was only at the start of the second act, when that decision was made for the audience, that I could embrace the full extent of the possibility that the Broadway camera offered.</span>

                              <span>However you measure the longterm efficacy of the NBA&#x27;s in-season tournament (we recommend this is as a helpful road sign), last night&#x27;s mass homage to Gilligan&#x27;s Island in San Francisco is what this event was always meant to be—an entertaining outlier on the all-important road to a trophy with no apparent value. That it was buried in the late window on a Tuesday night is one of those puzzling decisions that makes a person wonder if the NBA wants the tournament to matter to its bill-paying viewers in the way it hopes the tournament will someday matter to players.
There was no way to make this one not matter, though. Warriors-Mavericks was its own electronic billboard, a sure spike in the regular season drone no matter when it was played. Stephen Curry is one of the two pillars of the league&#x27;s ratings renaissance alongside King James I, and his brilliance has powered the league&#x27;s last two media rights contracts; Klay Thompson was Curry&#x27;s left ventricle on a series of near-magical teams that dominated much of the last decade. On Tuesday, they played against each other for the first time since Thompson chose expat status in Dallas with a team that, on paper, seemed to offer a better chance to get him a mood-altering fifth ring than the seemingly aging-out Warriors.</span>

                              <span>I spent the first year of the pandemic picking my battles. My partner and I tried many new things together: cooking pierogies, shaving our arms, playing the ukelele, getting so high you get lost in your own tinnitus, buying too many house plants, Animal Crossing. In one way, we succeeded in doing all these things, because we did do them and time did pass. In another way, failure was a universal constant. When that happens, it is probably not helpful to tell someone that you will scream if you have to hear &quot;Hallelujah&quot; on the ukelele one more time. 
But in the context of a massive crisis where so much is out of your control, what does it mean to be helpful? What is good when the world is upside-down? When the usual compasses stop working, many of us revert to bizarre reflexes and weaponized boredom. And who are we to judge?</span>

Joining me in skipping a Sunday shower was Syracuse football coach Fran Brown, whose team gave up 313 yards rushing in a 37-31 loss to Boston College on the same day I took my most recent shower. During a Monday press conference, Brown revealed that after losses, he is so despondent he does not shower. “I just brush my teeth,” he said. “I don’t deserve soap. I don’t deserve to do all that … winners get washed.” Brown says he can’t sleep in the same bed as his wife because he smells after losses. He finally showered Monday morning.</span>

                              <span>The weird, turnover-heavy first weeks of the college basketball season should be watched with a strong stomach and a roving eye. Navigate them the way you might an overstuffed museum wing: Sidle up to whatever looks interesting, scan the rest, and trust that you can always circle back later to see what you missed. Champions of the women’s game like to talk up that last point. On this side, where the best players stick around for three or four years, star power burns slow.
But if there’s an industry poorly served by this arrangement, it is blogging. We do not need to develop intricate parasocial relationships which players can leverage into brand deals; we need new people to post about! We need interesting new youths to wring through our take machine! We need, of course, freshmen, and already a couple have caught my eye. Think of this as an unofficial, non-exhaustive list of future stars. JuJu Watkins and Paige Bueckers, the season’s headliners, are plenty compelling themselves. All the more reason to place some novel obstacles in their way.</span>

                              <span>Tuesday&#x27;s game marked a measuring stick of sorts for both teams. The Jets, coming in with an NHL-record 14-1-0 start to their season, sought to keep the train rolling against one of the East&#x27;s contenders. The Rangers, with functionally the same roster as the one that won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy a year ago, hoped to prove they&#x27;re in the same league as the NHL&#x27;s best. It was a fun one, a back-and-forth 6-3 Jets victory in which Winnipeg showed conclusively they&#x27;re a cut above, playing relentless, mistake-free hockey behind the league&#x27;s best forward line and in front of the scariest goalie in the world.
Connor Hellebuyck vs. Igor Shesterkin was the undercard, pitting two of the last three Vezina winners, and coming at a time when Shesterkin is trying to lap Hellebuyck and every other netminder with his pending contract. The game didn&#x27;t quite play out as a duel—the Rangers turned the puck over too many times, and the Jets took too many penalties, for this one to feature any brilliant statlines in goal. Hellebuyck saved 33; Shesterskin stopped 27 of 32 for his second straight start allowing five goals.</span>

                              <span>Fans of chromatically bold hardwood courts rejoice: The NBA&#x27;s in-season tournament, freshly rebranded as the NBA Cup with a big fancy title sponsor, returned Tuesday night. In both basketball and business terms, last season&#x27;s inaugural go-round was a success, though there&#x27;s no guarantee that&#x27;s a permanent condition. Even if it&#x27;s bad, it will still be interesting, as the tournament will function as the league intends only if teams and players take it seriously, which requires them to make a series of revealing choices from among a handful of somewhat mutually exclusive options.
The NBA tipped the business ambitions of its FA Cup cosplay with the scheduling. Games take place on football-less Tuesdays and Fridays, in the hopes that the relative novelty and theoretically higher stakes will draw in larger audiences of curious casual viewers during the part of the NBA schedule when the games typically matter the least. Of course the NBA wants people to watch the first eighth of the interminable regular season, and the NBA Cup is a significantly more management-friendly alternative to shortening the schedule by the dozen or so games the union has occasionally asked for. If you&#x27;re not going to engineer significance through scarcity, simply enrich the existing offerings.</span>

                              <span>The first thing I thought when I saw the big pigeon was I wish I didn&#x27;t know the big pigeon was here. Oh, I was plenty charmed. It&#x27;s a hyperrealistic, 16-foot aluminum pigeon—like pizza, the basic idea is good enough that I&#x27;m not really sure there&#x27;s any version of the execution that wouldn&#x27;t have satisfied me. But I had come specifically to see the pigeon, and achieved that goal, and wished I had been surprised by it instead. Turned a corner and been gobsmacked by the pigeon, or been riding up 10th Avenue and seen the pigeon in the distance, getting ever-closer and -larger. What the hell? would have been my ideal reaction to seeing the big pigeon for the first time. Why is there a pigeon here?
Well, why not? It&#x27;s Manhattan. There are pigeons everywhere. Anywhere from half a million to nine million, depending on who you ask. Iván Argote, a Colombian artist living in Paris, has added one more with his sculpture which perches atop the High Line, an unused rail trestle turned linear park, and stares somewhat menacingly down on passing traffic. The sculpture is called Dinosaur (on display through spring 2026), and it does look more than a little saurian at this scale—the claws look like they could properly gut you, perhaps as revenge for all those times you didn&#x27;t offer his smaller cousins any crumbs. Close-up foot here, with, helpfully, a pigeon for scale.</span>

                              <span>Before Monday night&#x27;s game between the Miami Dolphins and Los Angeles Rams, ESPN reporter Jeff Darlington and Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa teamed up to produce one of the year&#x27;s strangest pieces of NFL-related media.
Tagovailoa is exactly the sort of young, talented, charismatic quarterback that the league and its broadcasters crave in order to sell fans on a Monday night game between two mediocre teams, so it makes sense that he would be the centerpiece of ESPN&#x27;s pregame coverage. Tagovailoa&#x27;s marketability is complicated, however, by the fact that he recently completed yet another stint on the IR after being concussed in Week 2. Tagovailoa&#x27;s career, from college to the pros, has been riddled with brain injuries, at such an alarming rate that many pundits were urging him to retire following the hit he took in September. Tagovailoa didn&#x27;t retire, though, and now he&#x27;s trying to salvage the Dolphins&#x27; season. It&#x27;s a story worth telling, surely, but how exactly does a network sell the story to fans?</span>

                              <span>Every morning, I make for myself a protein shake. It is my impression that this is good behavior, healthy and so forth. I do not consider it my business to engage in any even half-serious interrogation of this impression. The body requires protein, probably, and though I do enjoy gnawing on animal parts, it&#x27;s a lot simpler to fire down a daily hit of protein out of a shaker bottle (or three) than it is to make sure I have handfuls of meat available in the fridge at all times. Every morning, I open the pantry and hunt around for the tub of protein powder. Very often on these hunts, I encounter other, different tubs, tubs and bags of things that look like protein powder but possibly are not, or tubs or bags of things that definitely are not protein powder, but look and smell like they are meant to be dissolved in water and then consumed, for health. Health being good, I find it wise simply to throw a scoop or two of these things into the shaker bottle, to make the resulting sludge maximally healthful.
Here are some things that are going into my current &quot;protein&quot; shake, in order of application.</span>

                              <span>Bridget Everett is 52. She was 48 when HBO took on her show, Somebody Somewhere, now in its third and final season. The show, in which she plays the lead character, Sam, loosely depicts Everett’s own life, or at least the one she would have lived if she had stayed in Kansas instead of moving to New York, where she eventually became a downtown alt-cabaret star. If you consider her start getting her equity card around the age of 26, that’s a good two decades to get to the position she is in now, where her show is a Peabody Award winner and she no longer has to wait tables as a fallback. Depending on your perspective, that’s incredibly cool or incredibly nuts.
“Dreams don’t have deadlines.” The first time I saw Everett say that was in 2017, during an interview for the indie film Patti Cake$, in which she plays the alcoholic mother of a bartender (Danielle Macdonald) who aspires to become a rap star. “There’s a quote from LL Cool J,” Everett tells the young interviewer, laughing, “it’s DDHD—Dreams don’t have deadlines—and I live by that and I think everybody should live by it because it doesn’t matter if you’re 15, you’re 23, or you’re collecting retirement checks, just keep going for what makes you feel happy and follow and live your dream.”</span>
