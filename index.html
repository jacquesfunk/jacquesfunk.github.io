                              <span>Former NFL punter Chris Kluwe was arrested Tuesday night after speaking out in protest at a Huntington Beach City Council meeting. The California resident had voiced his disgust against a proposal to mark the 50th anniversary of the Huntington Beach Central Library with a plaque adorned with Trumpist kitsch. He spent the rest of his allotted time detailing what the MAGA movement actually represents.</span>

                              <span>It all started with a Messenger notification. In my inbox was a blurry image of a Tiramisu Cupcake sent by my grandpa, featuring a too-perfect frosting swirl with a thick coating of cocoa powder and a mysterious missing chunk from the cupcake liner that made me think: What kind of monster eats through the cupcake liner? 
Like so many times before, the picture that he sent accompanied a short note: &quot;Can we make this next time you&#x27;re home?&quot; Usually, I jump at the chance to plan a menu with my grandpa (my grandparents owned a restaurant for over 30 years and in lieu of going to culinary school, I learned how to cook from them). This time though, there was a problem: The post was very obviously AI-generated. When I called to tell him that the cupcake was AI—or &quot;made by a robot,&quot; as he said—he had no idea. He has since sent me dozens more AI recipes, despite our conversation.</span>

But soon the camera adjusts to reveal two white stellate shapes. They are too big, too lumpy and organic to be stars in the sky. As the camera drifts closer, they reveal themselves as sea stars, one with arms that taper elegantly, and one with arms that end in rounder stubs: the Bert and Ernie of the seafloor.</span>

                              <span>The only thing wrong about Canada&#x27;s 3-2 overtime triumph over the United States in Thursday&#x27;s 4 Nations title game is that there was only one extra period, and that lasted under 500 seconds. By rights, it could have, nay, should have lasted past midnight in the east, with every subsequent overtime as high-octane as the first.
Other than that, it could not have been much better as entertainment, as long as you accept the fact that there was an annoying level of contrivance to it. The country that cares most about hockey won, the game&#x27;s most recognizable player, Connor McDavid, scored the winning goal, the game&#x27;s disputably best player, Nathan MacKinnon, was named the most valuable player, and the goaltender who stole the show, Jordan Binnington, fully resuscitated the reputation as a big-game player he last enjoyed six years ago.</span>

                              <span>On a long enough time scale and if the sport is widely popular, a country tends to lose its dominance in a sport it creates. England ceded soccer long ago. The U.S. is, perhaps, in the process of losing its unquestioned position as the supreme basketballing nation. Canada, not for the first time and certainly not the last, faces a reckoning with its place in the hockey world. Since the fall of the U.S.S.R., the top of the sport has become more European, increasingly global, and, above all else, creepingly American. A smaller percentage of NHL players are from Canada than ever before, and more of the best players are from the U.S., as the league has expanded below the border and contracted above it. It&#x27;s a numbers game, and if it isn&#x27;t reflected in relative culture cachet, it&#x27;ll become apparent by who raises the trophies in international competition. Canada may well lose its iron grip on hockey—but not yet.
Team Canada re-expressed its dominion with a 3-2 overtime win over the U.S. in the final of the 4 Nations Face-Off, a totally made-up all-star replacement that almost accidentally stumbled its way into becoming a geopolitical referendum, and served as emphatic notice that the sport is still Canada&#x27;s to lose. I won&#x27;t drag out this blog before giving you the climactic goal, the one that&#x27;ll be replayed for years and years. And because the champions wear red maple leaves, you get the Chris Cuthbert call:</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard to know whether or not Bayern Munich is particularly good this season. On one hand, they have the best stats in Europe. Die Roten score more domestic goals than anyone in the Old Continent&#x27;s top-five leagues, and allow among the fewest. Even in the Champions League, where their underwhelming results consigned them to the funky but fun new format&#x27;s purgatory round, the Germans could point to their competition-best expected goal difference as evidence that their performances have been better than the scoreboards might indicate. And just in terms of pure talent, Bayern doesn&#x27;t have to look at any other team&#x27;s roster with envy. By all accounts, this should be one of the best teams in the world.
On the other hand, Bayern&#x27;s cumulative showings across the season give off a strong whiff of a flat-track bully. Though they consistently hammer their lessers, Bayern&#x27;s record against more or less equals isn&#x27;t very good: four draws and no wins against Bayer Leverkusen (twice), Eintracht Frankfurt, and Borussia Dortmund in league play, a loss to Leverkusen that bounced them from the German Cup, and three Champions League defeats to Aston Villa, Barcelona, and Feyenoord by a combined score of 8-1. A 1-0 win over almost-didn&#x27;t-even-make-it-to-purgatory Paris Saint-Germain and a 5-1 Bundesliga win over FC Lawn Ball Sports are the closest Bayern has come to statement victories this season.</span>

                              <span>About halfway through this week&#x27;s episode, returning champion guest Rohan Nadkarni asked a question I didn&#x27;t really know how to answer. We&#x27;d spent the first half talking about the NBA, which I enjoyed, and per the pre-show rundown the idea was to get back to it for a while in the second half before things kind of inexorably move in the direction of &quot;talking about fried appetizers&quot; in the way they always do on Rohan episodes. But before we could do that, Rohan asked why it is that we still feel compelled to do the sports talk at all when we could very easily justify doing an entire hour on foods we have enjoyed, with a couple Funbag questions stuck on at the end. It wasn&#x27;t a gag, or anyway it wasn&#x27;t just a gag. It&#x27;s a good question.</span>

                              <span>On Thursday morning, the NBA announced that Milwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis would be suspended for 25 games after testing positive for the pain medication tramadol. The Bucks have 29 games left in the regular season, so they will be without a critical player for an extremely important stretch run in which they will have to fight desperately to stay in front of, somehow, the Detroit Pistons. Portis, in turn, will lose $2.8 million in game checks, so everyone involved is screwed—all over what Portis&#x27;s representatives are calling an accident involving a substance of questionable performance benefit.
As Portis&#x27;s agent Mark Bartlestein detailed to ESPN&#x27;s Shams Charania, Portis takes the very similarly named Toradol to manage pain and inflammation from an elbow contusion he picked up at the start of the season, which explains the mixup. &quot;The tramadol pill he took came from an assistant of his, with a valid prescription for the painkiller, which he mistakenly told Bobby was Toradol,&quot; said Bartlestein. Portis does not plan to appeal the suspension.</span>

                              <span>Victor Wembanyama will not play for the rest of the regular season due to a deep vein thrombosis in his left shoulder, the Spurs announced Thursday. The team believes that the blood clot is an &quot;isolated condition,&quot; per Shams Charania of ESPN.
Wembanyama was on court as recently as Sunday&#x27;s All-Star Game, where he tried pretty hard, at least within the context of that game. The team said that the condition was discovered upon his return to San Antonio. Wembanyama had been feeling &quot;low energy,&quot; and that feeling persisted throughout the All-Star break, which prompted the tests that uncovered the blood clot, according to Sam Amick of The Athletic. The Spurs are optimistic he&#x27;ll return for the 2025-26 season, Tim MacMahon of ESPN reported, citing a team source.</span>

Leaning in to a (friendly!!!) rivalry with our closest neighbor, and hopefully beating them at their own sport, and, maybe if we&#x27;re lucky, making Brad Marchand cry. I didn&#x27;t sign on for Team USA becoming the icebound avatar of Trumpism.
Blame Bill Guerin. On Monday the former NHLer and Team USA GM went on Fox News to plead with the president to attend Thursday&#x27;s 4 Nations Face-Off final in Boston, a rematch of Saturday&#x27;s game that saw the U.S. defeat Canada 3-1 in Montreal, before which the American anthem received moderate but notable boos. After that, a whole bunch of people who have never watched a hockey game in their life all of a sudden became huge, or at least loud, Team USA fans because their politics consist solely of supporting things that will upset the people they&#x27;re told they should hate.</span>

                              <span>A few weeks ago, I was going through the thousand-odd people I follow on one social media site in an effort to ease my transition onto another, when I noticed that I was still following the accounts of several people who were dead. I tabbed over to their pages, knowing I would not see anything profound or overwhelming, merely the mundane thoughts they&#x27;d had in 2013, 2017, or 2024, preserved in amber as long as the platform clings to life. The contrast between ephemerality and permanence was jarring. I didn&#x27;t know whether it felt more respectful to continue following them or let them go.
This precise, hypermodern dissonance is one of the subjects of Jeremy Gordon&#x27;s forthcoming novel, See Friendship. Gordon&#x27;s book tells the story of Jacob, a somewhat adrift digital-media drone who needs to create something substantial to keep his career going. Once he learns that a close high school friend named Seth did not die in his sleep as he was told, but under stranger and more tragic circumstances, he decides to create a narrative podcast investigating the death.</span>

                              <span>The National Court of Spain delivered its verdict today in the trial of former national soccer federation (RFEF) president Luis Rubiales, charged with sexual assault over the unbidden, nonconsensual kiss he planted on the mouth of women&#x27;s national team star Jenni Hermoso during the medal ceremony after Spain&#x27;s victory in the 2023 World Cup. Judge José Manuel Fernández-Prieto found Rubiales guilty of the assault charge, but acquitted him of an accompanying charge of coercion concerning his subsequent efforts at pressuring Hermoso into supporting him and downplaying the incident.
Although the prosecution had asked for a prison sentence of one year for the sexual assault charge (and a further 18 months for the coercion), the court opted to impose a fine instead: €20 per day over 18 months, €10,800 in total. Rubiales is also forbidden from contacting Hermoso or coming within 200 meters of her for one year. Also acquitted of coercion were Rubiales&#x27;s fellow defendants on that charge, former women&#x27;s national team coach Jorge Vilda and former federation executives Albert Luque and Rubén Rivera.</span>

                              <span>The “black box” in the title of Shiori Itō’s documentary Black Box Diaries, in which the journalist investigates her own sexual assault, essentially refers to the excuse Japan gives for not properly investigating rape cases. “Because it’s in a black box, we’ll never really know what happened,” is what Itō was told, and as she says in the film, “I think that tells everything about our justice system.” But the black box works as a loose metaphor for another kind of unknowability that permeates the documentary, which was recently nominated for an Academy Award and is made up largely of personal video diaries, sound recordings, and a fly-on-the wall footage of the filmmaker as she investigates her case and ultimately writes a memoir about it (Black Box, 2017). Itō explains a few times that her way of surviving is to wrap herself up in work, to treat her case as a journalist would. But in the midst of this singular focus, the filmmaker in a sense puts herself—that is, Itō the survivor—in a black box. In the midst of this grand investigation, she herself remains unexamined. “I realized I haven’t faced myself,” she says at one point. The tension between the two sides of her—Itō the journalist and Itō the survivor—makes Black Box Diaries a kind of stealth dual narrative, one in which it becomes clear that a guilty verdict is not the end, not even close.
The film starts with a trigger warning, and I will defer to it here. Itō’s documentary opens with cherry blossom petals floating along the water beneath a script warning of the content and offering up how she has dealt with triggers in the past: by closing her eyes, by taking a deep breath. The flowers seem like just a pretty aesthetic choice at first, but by the end of the film you learn that these petals themselves became a trigger for Itō, and only later did she realize it was because the crime took place during cherry blossom season.</span>

                              <span>What do you get the club that has everything? Trophies provide a buzz, as does dominance over another of the so-called titans of European soccer, but nothing gets the juices flowing more than a brand-new superstar. Soccer is a team sport, but few things can tilt the favor in the direction of one team more than a world-beating attacker. Real Madrid already had one such superstar in Vinícius Junior, but Wednesday&#x27;s second leg against Manchester City demonstrated why one is never enough for this club and its limitless ambition. These must-win games, in the competition Real Madrid has won more than anyone else, are why the club spent multiple summers courting and, eventually, landing Kylian Mbappé.

Last Friday, my partner T and I were lucky enough to visit an insect lab at the American Museum of Natural History. The room was hot, humid, and smelled faintly of roach, because, well, there were lots of roaches there. Some were familiar, like the cocktail-sausage shaped Madagascar hissing cockroaches, and others were strange, like some freshly molted cave cockroaches whose newly hardened bodies gleamed the ethereal yellow of a bamboo shoot.</span>

Also, the Anti-Defamation League would browbeat you for writing it, in between administering back rubs for Elon Musk. But that&#x27;s what happened this past weekend in Miami Beach.
Mordechai Brafman, 27, told police that he shot 17 times at a vehicle Saturday night because he thought the two occupants were Palestinian. He also thought he killed them. In reality, they were Israeli tourists and very much alive. Ari Rabi was shot in the shoulder; his father Yaron was grazed on his forearm. Both were taken to the hospital, but not seriously injured. Brafman was charged with two counts of second-degree attempted murder.</span>

                              <span>As the dog teams competing in the 2014 Yukon Quest rested at the race’s halfway point in Dawson City, I drove my Jeep Grand Cherokee out onto the frozen Yukon River. In Dawson, the main townsite sits on one side of the water, but the teams take their mandatory midpoint layover in a public campground on the other. For many years, an ice bridge has been built to connect the two sides—the main town and its more remote west-side suburbs—robust enough for even heavy vehicle traffic. During my coverage of the 2012 and 2013 Quests, I had always driven onto the ice bridge from the sloping boat ramp where a ferry docks in summer. That night in 2014, I did the same. It was very dark, and very, very cold.
I’d befriended a photographer from New York who was in town to cover the race, and she was in my passenger seat as I rolled us out onto the ice. We were partway across when I spotted an irregularity, a patch of darkness that resisted the light of my headlights. There was, I realized, open water lurking not all that far ahead of me. I tried not to panic, tried not to let on that we were both possibly about to die. Holding my breath, I put the Jeep into reverse, and eased back along my own tire tracks until we were on solid ground again. The next day, I learned that the bridge had been rerouted to cross farther upriver.</span>

                              <span>Maintaining a connection to your creative side can feel idiotic at best and selfish at worst during times like these. We&#x27;re officially halfway through The Artist&#x27;s Way, and this week we&#x27;re definitely negotiating the tension between nudging our creativity and the reality of the world right now.
It would be an understatement to say spirits aren&#x27;t high right now. Julia Cameron&#x27;s blithe, prosperity gospel-y point of view may come from a sincere place, but it feels especially grating and out of touch at the moment. Luckily for us having a common annoyance can also be a useful source of inspiration.</span>

                              <span>Over the past month, I&#x27;ve had plenty of days where my brain insists that I need to get the hell off the computer. This command is an inconvenient one when all of your professional responsibilities are on the computer, but as far as mental health struggles go, it&#x27;s actually one of the better ones, because it pushes me out of my apartment and into the world of friends and movies and art. I always feel better when I&#x27;m among more than just myself—trading an impersonal infinite bombardment for a more intentional communication borne of other people&#x27;s creativity and love.
Tuesday was rough, but I was lucky to have a ticket to the New York Philharmonic that night—a performance conducted by Karina Canellakis and main evented by Claude Debussy&#x27;s sweeping masterpiece La Mer. I have no education in classical music and rarely listen to it on my own, but I do have a sincere appreciation for the craft of playing an instrument, and beyond that respect I also look forward to engaging with these unfamiliar pieces of music, which force my ears to evaluate a brand new sensory experience without much assistance. Like a detective or an explorer, you get the stimulus, and then you have to decide what to make of it. It comes in a language all its own, and your emotional reaction to the message is yours alone.</span>

                              <span>This time last week, I had what I assume to be the average level of knowledge about Yoko Ono and her art: She screamed, she protested, she was a little too present in a project that wasn’t hers, and she continued creating art that advocated for peace even after watching her husband get shot right in front of her. 
But in terms of what that art actually was, I would have had trouble describing or naming any of it. This struck me as a cultural oversight on my part, so I did what anyone would do and signed up to attend a two-day academic and artistic symposium celebrating her work in honor of her 92nd birthday.</span>

                              <span>In a dream scenario for every ESPN producer, basketball-adjacent yapper, and SpringHill Company stakeholder, the Los Angeles Lakers will be the most fascinating team to watch during the NBA&#x27;s sprint to the playoffs. It&#x27;s not even close: No other team in the league so dramatically rejiggered itself at the trade deadline, to the point that the Luka Doncic trade feels categorically incomparable to the De&#x27;Aaron Fox or Jimmy Butler trades. The Lakers are fifth in the Western Conference at the moment, uncomfortably equipoised between second and eighth, leaving them very little latitude in figuring out how to get their two superstars, who are 15 years apart in age, on the same page.
Most intriguing of all, they have to do it with a hilariously unbalanced team. Days after snagging Doncic, L.A. agreed to trade a cache of future assets for permanently mangled Charlotte Hornets center Mark Williams—only to get him in for a physical and learn that there was apparently a compelling medical reason that he had played only 85 games in three seasons. Whatever the Lakers braintrust saw was bad enough that it compelled them to rescind the trade, which is a huge bummer for Williams and will probably cost him millions of dollars, and leaves the Lakers with a half-formed roster, without a functional two-way big. This is what makes them so fascinating. They have to try and win big, capitalizing on what&#x27;s turning into a great LeBron campaign, with a totally compromised squad. The Lakers did not intend to have their season serve as evidence in the ongoing trial of whether or not big men have a place in the NBA, though that&#x27;s now their burden.</span>
