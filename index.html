                              <span>Last week, the Washington Post wrote about why so many of the people that wait in line for hours to get into Donald Trump&#x27;s political rallies wind up leaving before they&#x27;re over. The answers are not necessarily surprising. Trump often takes the stage more than an hour late, and in his current state of diminishment his speeches are mostly a matter of him maundering, salty and glum and increasingly damp, through a free-associative list of half-remembered cable news gripes. Some of the people the Post spoke to left because they were sick of &quot;the insults,&quot; which feels a bit like storming out of a steakhouse dinner just before dessert because you don&#x27;t eat meat. But most left because they had other things that they needed to do, and couldn&#x27;t really justify not doing those things because they ne…</span>

                              <span>If you take the New York Jets aspect out of the thing, and then further strip a bunch of really crucial context from it, it is easy to see how Jets fans might have been optimistic about this season. The roster is as talented as any Jets team in recent memory, with the crew of Emotional Support Teammates that the team furnished Aaron Rodgers with last season mostly turned over in favor of more obviously NFL-grade contributors; Rodgers himself is as healthy as any 40-year-old NFL quarterback could be, which does not necessarily rise to the level of physical wellness traditionally associated with the word &quot;healthy&quot; but has mostly allowed him to stay on the field and intermittently do Aaron Rodgers-style football stuff; the defense, while depleted after some typically avant-garde front office maneuvering during the offseason, has the personnel to be good. In the abstract, the Jets are the sort of team that even reasonable fans could talk themselves into. In another, much more urgent, literal, and less abstracted sense, they remain the New York Jets.
That the Jets found a way to lose to the Minnesota Vikings in London on Sunday is less surprising with that in mind. The defense played its second straight excellent game, stymieing a Vikings offense that had been one of the NFL&#x27;s best and effectively turning Sam Darnold back into the forlorn figure he was during his tenure with the Jets. But that Jetsian aura, a fragrant greenish fug in which all Jets games have been played for roughly the last decade and a half, affects everyone on the field. And on Sunday, even as the Jets defense succeeded in turning the game at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium into the unloveliest possible demonstration of American football, Aaron Rodgers was absolutely lost in it.</span>

                              <span>Round up a little, and Diego Pavia might well be six feet tall, his generously listed height. Before he transferred to Vanderbilt, he played at New Mexico State, and before that at the New Mexico Military Institute, where he committed out of high school as a two-star recruit. If there was any hint of what was to come, of the wild self-belief required to lead an upset of the No. 1 team in the country, it was that Pavia arrived in Nashville with a suspiciously rich lore. See: the no-look pass he once threw because his helmet was on completely backwards; the in-state rivalry taken so far it ended with an Albuquerque Journal story headlined “NMSU coach ‘disappointed’ in Diego Pavia after urination video”; the wrestling move he once tried on an Auburn defensive back, the only time I can remember a quarterback being called for unnecessary roughness. In that context and perhaps only in that context, Saturday’s Alabama-Vanderbilt game, a 40-35 Vandy win and maybe the biggest upset in SEC history, makes perfect sense. 
Pavia had plenty of things to say after the win; unfortunately for the SEC Network standards and practices department, about 40 percent of it would need to be bleeped out later. (“Vandy, we’re fucking turnt!” he shouted into the mic, moments after explaining that God had given him a vision of this as a little kid.) In the stadium postgame, Vanderbilt looped a quote from Nick Saban over the PA. Two weeks ago on the Pat McAfee show, the former Alabama coach said, “The only place you play in the SEC that’s not hard to play is Vanderbilt.”</span>

                              <span>The moment at which an astute but otherwise objective observer might have begun getting suspicious about whether something might be going on with the New York Mets would probably have been late June. This was when it came out that the team had adopted as a clubhouse anthem the song that a reserve infielder had recorded in his home studio about being grateful and having a nice time. I can only guess at that perspective in this case, but take your own fan investments out of it and run this exercise through yourself. 
If you learned that, after wins, the baseball team you cared about was shouting along to the chorus of a song that the resident thirtysomething utility spork had recorded in his spare time—it could be Kevin Newman or Donovan Solano or whoever you like, in whatever genre you find most amusing to imagine—there would be in that news the sense that the good kind of weird thing was happening in that clubhouse. Any team that signed Jose Iglesias to a minor league deal, installed him as an everyday player out of necessity and watched him have the best season of his career at the age of 34, adopted his song, and then won nearly two out of every three games for four months would have some sense of destiny about it. It&#x27;s simply too stupid not to mean something. The challenge has been believing that this could happen, and then accepting that it was indeed happening, to the New York Mets.</span>

                              <span>Do you find yourself involuntarily salivating for Twin Snakes or Starmix? Are you standing tippy-toe for a handful of Sour Patch Watermelons? Is there a nonstop conveyer belt of tart treats going down your gullet? There is another way. I want to open a muscadine clinic for all the Haribo loyalists in the world. Nature&#x27;s gummy candy could fill the void as summer turns to fall.
The muscadine is a grape, but not the kind that populates fruit salads and Ziploc baggies. Those are mushy, easily yielding to the teeth, tossed into the mouth and eaten whole. Instead, the muscadine is an imposing orb that forces the eater to meditate upon its structure. Its skin might be a dull green with a purplish blush, or a wine-dark purple with a pinkish blush; it might have a dusty metallic sheen. It might be rough and speckled on the surface, a little leathery, and strangely taut. If that doesn&#x27;t sound like a pleasant bite of fruit, that&#x27;s fine—you won&#x27;t actually be eating that part. Think of the muscadine as an individually packaged treat.</span>

It&#x27;s a pivotal period in which the best movies expected to arrive just before the year&#x27;s Oscar cutoff get an early screening. This year&#x27;s edition has amassed a roster of greatly hyped and neat surprise movies from all over the world. Some of these movies, like the sure-to-be-favorite of the extremely online Anora, the masterful Nickel Boys, Luca Guadagnino&#x27;s ambitious William S. Burroughs adaptation Queer, and David Cronenberg&#x27;s latest The Shrouds, deserve their own blogs as the wider public gets to see them. In the meantime, here are a collection of movies I enjoyed and wanted to say a little something about.

                              <span>David Foster Wallace had a thing for boredom. He had such a thing for it that he turned it into a kind of last legacy. According to a lengthy (and pretty great) piece in The New Yorker by D.T. Max published a year after Wallace died by suicide in 2008, he left behind a third of his final novel, The Pale King, for which he had spent countless hours researching boredom. A typed note he also left behind laid out the book’s central intention: “Bliss—a-second-by-second joy and gratitude at the gift of being alive, conscious—lies on the other side of crushing, crushing boredom. Pay close attention to the most tedious thing you can find (Tax Returns, Televised Golf) and, in waves, a boredom like you’ve never known will wash over you and just about kill you. Ride these out, and it’s like stepping from black and white into color. Like water after days in the desert. Instant bliss in every atom.” 
This interest of Wallace’s has been closely connected to mindfulness, but the two things are a little different. Mindfulness is an awareness of things as they come, it is a kind of riding out, but that’s not exactly bliss you find through it so much as a kind of acceptance—which, to a person in constant distress, can no doubt, relatively speaking, feel like bliss. “Pay close attention to the most tedious thing you can find.” I didn’t realize this would be Joker: Folie à Deux.</span>

                              <span>On July 8, an all-star team from the Northwest Washington Little League (NWLL) faced off against Mamie Johnson Little League to open the D.C. city championship tournament, the first round in the global annual tournament for ballplayers 12 years old and under that ends with the Little League World Series. The game came to a halt in the middle of the sixth and final inning, when the NWLL first baseman picked up the game ball on his way to his position, prompting the home plate umpire to loudly declare that the first baseman now had to pitch. With NWLL up 6-0 and three outs away from advancing, manager Mike Klisch walked onto the field and spent several minutes conferring with the umpire. The first baseman had already pitched the first four innings before being relieved, so he was likely ineligible to return to the mound. It took a phone call from the ump to Little League headquarters to untangle the rules. 
“Is there a 24-hour line to answer questions about rules?” an NWLL mother in the crowd asked as the game resumed.</span>

                              <span>How fast the mighty fall, and timely, too. The Houston Astros&#x27; seven-year streak of reaching the ALCS ended the same night that the Atlanta Braves&#x27; six-year streak of reaching the NLDS did the same, and each in an unceremonious sweep—at least, as much as a sweep can be a sweep in a three-game postseason series. At the very least, the Milwaukee Brewers spared us an extra day without any postseason baseball by forcing a Game 3 against the Mets.
No sensible person will cry about these developments. The Astros are the Astros, and the Braves were a dead team walking even entering the playoffs; better they just be put out of their misery. Other than the overarching sentiment towards both teams&#x27; failings, conflating them is a bit misleading. The postseason record that the Astros strung together might be distasteful, but has to garner some level of respect: No other team has managed it. Meanwhile, &quot;reaching the NLDS&quot; can sound impressive when phrased that way, but even in the expanded playoffs, half the teams that reach a Divisional Series do it through the regular season.</span>

                              <span>What&#x27;s the absolute best kind of hit? A grand slam, you might say. I suppose, yeah, objectively, that&#x27;s right. But after Andy Ibáñez knocked a bases-loaded double into the left corner pocket in the eighth inning of a tied Tigers-Astros game on Wednesday, Tigers fans might disagree. With the bases-clearing two-bagger, they received beat after beat of great news: the suspenseful declaration that the ball was fair, and then the dramatic build of an incrementally larger lead. &quot;One run scores! ... Two runs score! ... Evvvvvverybody scores!&quot; It was as good as it gets, and so was the rest of the afternoon for the Detroiters, as Houston went 1-2-3, 1-2-3 to eject themselves from the postseason barely 24 hours after it began.

                              <span>Here we are again. For most of Erik ten Hag&#x27;s tenure at Manchester United, England&#x27;s most storied club has been reeling. Though his first season, the 2022-23 edition, was a moderate success—third place in the Premier League and a League Cup trophy, after a 2021-22 season in which the club finished sixth with no trophies—it&#x27;s been downhill since. Instead of building on that return to decency, last season United finished eighth in the league and last in its Champions League group, looking dire for most of the campaign.
The Dutch manager was almost immediately on the hot seat last season, losing four out of seven matches in the first six weeks, and it didn&#x27;t get much better as the season went on. A 4-0 loss to Crystal Palace in early May seemed to signal the end of his time at Old Trafford, but a shock FA Cup final victory over Manchester City bought him enough of a reprieve to try again this season. A spendy summer followed that victory, and if not a return to title contention, the United faithful and brass probably expected a solid push for the top four. If the first six weeks of this season are to be believed, however, they&#x27;re in for more of the same, which has to have put Ten Hag on the brink of the unemployment line.</span>
