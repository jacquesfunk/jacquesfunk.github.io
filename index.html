                              <span>Cooper Flagg got the ball at his own free-throw line with 4.6 seconds left. He looked up at the clock and sped down the court. Arizona was out of sorts in transition defense, and Flagg stopped behind the three-point line with a ton of space around him. He beat the buzzer easily. He’d hit a three on the previous possession, too. “We talk about inflection points,” said Kon Knueppel, who had 20 points in Duke’s 100-93 win over Arizona in the Sweet 16 last Thursday, “and the end of the half is a really big inflection point. So it was tie ballgame, and hit two threes gives us a bunch of momentum coming into the second half.” Flagg finished with 30 points, 6 rebounds, and 7 assists.
Flagg didn’t do as much in the Elite 8 win over Alabama on Saturday, but he also didn’t have to. Alabama-Duke had the look of a classic beforehand, and then the Blue Devils jumped out to a 15-5 lead five minutes in and were never really challenged in a 85-65 win. They put it away with a 13-0 stretch over five minutes late in the game. Flagg opened that run with an impressive one-hander after backing down AP All-American Mark Sears. He beat Sears again a few minutes later with a layup he basically shot sideways.</span>

Hence, the Detroit Pistons in this, the beginning of their latest renaissance, having to relearn everything here at the hinder end of the regular season. Since their last trip to the Eastern Conference Final in 2008, they have had the worst record in the NBA, their worst record in team history, the longest losing streak in league history, lost their last 12 playoff games, and in general been easy to dismiss—hence their persistent dismissal.</span>

                              <span>UCLA chose an odd way to muscle itself into its first women&#x27;s Final Four—by seeing its muscle get into early foul trouble and having her sit out the entire second quarter. This would surely be LSU&#x27;s moment as the very live and historically imposing three-seed in a tournament full of chalk.
Instead, the Bruins somehow managed to be better without center Lauren Betts than they were with her, as counterintuitive as that seems, building themselves a workable lead that they could then safely defend through the second half, when Betts returned to re-establish her place in the game&#x27;s highlight reel. In all, it was a structurally odd way for the Bruins to finally break through the bracket ceiling, but the final score of 72-65 was an accurate portrayal of the difference between the two teams.</span>

                              <span>Perhaps it was not a coincidence that on Friday night Alysa Liu wore gold. That&#x27;s when the 19-year-old took to the ice in Boston for this year&#x27;s figure skating world championships and made it all look so easy, like she never left figure skating (which she did), as if her victory had been assured all season (it was not). Skating to Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;MacArthur Park,&quot; Liu didn&#x27;t just land her jumps, she seemed to float. Her entire performance exuded ease and joy, without a stumble or slip to be found. When Liu neared the end of her routine with a gorgeous layback slide across the ice, the crowd roared. You know it&#x27;s a powerful performance when former Olympians Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir stop talking and just let the skating speak for itself. At one point, broadcaster Terry Gannon asked Lipinski if she believed what she was seeing. The Olympic gold medalist replied, &quot;I am not!&quot;
Even Liu herself was surprised, telling her coaches as she walked off the ice into a giant group hug, &quot;What the hell?!?&quot;</span>

                              <span>The AFC South has always been kind of a meh-stival—four under-noticed teams (just one media market inside the top 25) all doing relatively dull things (having the worst cumulative record since the division became an actual thing) and only very occasionally getting our attention for anything other than draft position. Thus it is with admiration as well as curiosity that we gaze upon the escalating uniform war between the Houston Texans and Tennessee Titans over the use of what the rest of us would just call light blue.
Or as the Titans call it, Titans blue. Or as the Texans call it, H-Town blue. Or as the rest of us call it, &quot;The Nothing Else To Do Battle Royal.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Jake Bauers looked history right in the eye and spat dead on its cornea. But that&#x27;s what great non-pitcher pitchers do. And when they do it on a late-model recreation of the biggest stage of all, it is all the more, well, more.
Bauers, the Milwaukee Brewers&#x27; backup first baseman, was looking Saturday morning at a relatively relaxing afternoon in Yankee Stadium. He wasn&#x27;t in the starting lineup and, if things went well, he wouldn&#x27;t be needed. Instead, it went galactically not. The Yankees started the game with three consecutive first-pitch homers off Nestor Cortes, a major league record for instantaneous pitcher abuse, and even then it seemed fair to assume that Bauers wouldn&#x27;t be needed for defensive or pinch-hitting reasons in a close game. But by the third inning, when 3-0 became 13-3, Bauers&#x27; availability became inevitability. As the Brewers&#x27; designated lost-cause pitcher, he has the responsibility of saving relievers&#x27; arms when a game is declared beyond redemption, and the Yankees had delivered the necessary conditions in near-record time.</span>

                              <span>The summer after I got married, one of my bosses bit me on the arm. I had a lot of jobs that summer, and a lot of bosses; at the time, I was recreating the sort of interchangeable, poorly paid jobs I&#x27;d had throughout my twenties in exhausting freelanced aggregate. The boss that bit me was the co-owner of a real estate agency that paid me more or less minimum wage to jam search keywords into apartment rental listings, write bios for their agents and copy for their website, and oversee whatever other writing or editorial work needed doing. There was a lot of that; unpaid college interns and international employees churned through the office nonstop, and their combined labor and movement kept the agency&#x27;s burgeoning online presence stocked with fresh spam. Agents came and went as agents do, as did various ostensible eminences—I remember one, after being told by my boss that I had written for The Wall Street Journal, excitedly launching into a speech about &quot;a disease called PC-itis&quot; like a child actor at an audition—and prayer group buddies and transient subletters and an intense Georgian named George, whom I liked and sometimes brought me strange Georgian desserts. It sucked.
When my boss bit me, I had just questioned his wish to include an easily disprovable lie in his bio, which I was writing on his computer, at his desk. I was shocked by the bite, but less surprised by the look on his face afterwards—he was flushed and eager, like a child that has just discovered how to be naughty, his eyes shining and a little wet. As with the cohort that generally does that sort of thing, which is weird little kids acting out in daycare settings, there was a question implied in that look—what would be the consequence for doing a thing that you are absolutely not supposed to do? In retrospect, I wonder if he was waiting to see if I&#x27;d hit him.</span>

                              <span>I was overly aware of my response the night I saw Moby-Dick at the Met. I don’t know the first thing about opera and, more worryingly, I’ve become known to friends as a person who won’t stop talking about the novel. Some of those people came with me that Saturday night, but no one really knew what to expect. 
Moby-Dick, originally adapted for opera in 2010 by composer Jake Heggie, is an American creation that was neither deemed consequential or groundbreaking upon its publication. Demonstrating the lives of many artists before and since, Herman Melville died in relative obscurity and with limited financial resources. The Moby-Dick opera premiered at the Dallas Opera nearly 200 years after the novel’s publication and has since toured around the country, from L.A. to D.C. The libretto is in English and its references, like the novel, pertain to the seafaring culture of northeastern America.</span>

                              <span>Less than a month before the NBA playoffs begin, the Memphis Grizzlies announced today that they have fired head coach Taylor Jenkins. This is fairly shocking news, for the timing and also because Jenkins was seen as rather entrenched in Memphis. He&#x27;d been there since the 2019–20 season, making him the fifth-longest tenured coach in the NBA. Jenkins was weeks away from coaching his fourth playoffs with the Grizzlies.
&quot;I&#x27;m genuinely appreciative of Taylor&#x27;s contributions to this team and this city over the past six seasons,&quot; general manager Zach Kleiman said in a statement. &quot;This was a difficult decision given the consistent and tangible development of our players and overall success under Taylor&#x27;s leadership. I wish Taylor the very best going forward.&quot; Kleiman and Jenkins were hired during the same offseason, so this is not a case of a GM dumping a coach inherited from a previous regime, but there were signs of unrest last summer. Kleiman oversaw a dramatic revamping of Jenkins&#x27;s staff, cleaning out the entire bench save for Patrick St. Andrews and Anthony Carter, each of whom had been hired just the previous offseason. In came six new coaches, including, most importantly, Finnish coach Tuomas Iisalo.</span>

                              <span>On a Friday morning in December, I found myself sitting on a bench outside a federal courtroom in Brooklyn. I was attending the sentencing of Carlos Watson, my former employer at Ozy Media from 2018 to 2020, because a curiosity had gnawed at me: Would he express remorse? What would he have to say for himself? 
Watson had been found guilty of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and aggravated identity theft by a federal jury in July. Now was time for his sentencing. I had experienced how disorienting it was to work for someone who routinely bent reality to match his will and beliefs. I was curious how it might feel watching Watson finally be forced to adhere to a judge’s reality and a jury’s findings—and potentially confront the consequences.</span>

                              <span>Welcome to The Backlog, a series in which we will take a look back at 12 games from 2020 that, in one way or another, had a lasting impact on the video game industry. 
In the first two installments of The Backlog, I looked at games that released in January of 2020. Part of this is because February was a bit of a dead month, and part of it is because I wanted to set the stage. The world was mostly normal that month, though there were already warning signs about the coronavirus. A botched remake of a classic game and a sequel to a long-running franchise ... those were the games that could make waves in a slow period for games. Now, though, we come to March of 2020, where things went off the rails very quickly.</span>

                              <span>The Chicago Bulls—I know! Listen, I know. It is March 28. Baseball has returned. Redbuds and daffodils are blossoming. Goldfinches are going yellow. There are better things to talk about, and even if there weren&#x27;t, there would be more serious things to talk about than this goofy-ass basketball team, which has been mired in miserable grinding sub-mediocrity for, Christ, a decade! Nevertheless, here we are. As I was saying: The Chicago Bulls—and really we are never going to get to the end of this if you can&#x27;t dispense with the whole groaning eye-roll thing, so please—are on one. It cannot be denied. These chaotic rebuilding bozos are currently shredding just about everything in their path. They&#x27;ve now won four in a row, and nine of their last 11. These are not horseshit wins: Over this run they have beaten seven teams that are currently in playoff position. Thursday night they beat the Lakers for the second time in five days; in between they exhausted and befuddled and totally worked over the Denver Nuggets.
That first win over the Lakers was an eye-popping beatdown, a 31-point destruction in Los Angeles against a would-be title contender very much motivated to reverse a recent swoon. The Bulls were out of their minds: Josh Giddey had 17 assists and eight steals; rookie Matas Buzelis put up a career-best 31 points; Coby White scored 36 on just 17 shot attempts. The Lakers were made to look dumpy and slow, and came to Chicago Thursday hoping for a better showing. Instead they spent most of the early stages of the game once again being made to look like old tired uncles, falling behind early and trailing the floppy-haired Bulls by as many as 13 points, and only scrapping back to within a possession in the final minutes before halftime. The game turned in the second half, and the Lakers built up a 19-point lead early in the fourth quarter. This was a win in-hand for a fairly desperate veteran team.</span>

                              <span>Whatever you want to call the current age of television, it is far from golden and far from the prestige era of the late aughts. Instead we have entered into some sort of silver age, where television has all the qualitative earmarks of the prestige era—fancy, though digitally glossy, cinematography, showy directing, big stars, elaborate stage production—but with the kind of story churn and writing that more resembles the kind of television I grew up on.
I&#x27;d compare present-day TV to the cable dramas of the late 2000s. Shows like the 911 series, Defector favorite Reacher, The Pitt, or the Taylor Sheridan and Tyler Perry television universes hearken back to familiar TV tropes of the 2000s, but with bigger names and often more elaborate filmmaking. I find this mostly refreshing. At the peak of the prestige era, it felt like television had forgotten something fundamental about its medium that separates it from movies—you spend more time with these characters and therefore they become members of your family, and you want to care about their stories and not just try and solve some overarching mystery the entire time. For every True Detective or Twin Peaks: The Return, there were a lot more Westworlds and Black Mirrors, shows that tend to fall apart when you&#x27;re no longer invested in solving their puzzles. TV should still be a little boilerplate, and should be more about characters than the story.</span>

                              <span>In a game from the gods, Texas Tech played its way into a not-so-sweet 16-point second-half deficit against Arkansas, then played its way out. And then some. The gutsy and fun Red Raiders used a late bank shot from Darrion Williams and some great last-second defense to beat John Calipari’s Razorbacks, 85-83, in the first overtime game of this year’s NCAA Tournament. Tech now advances to Saturday’s West Region final. 
Tech, the No. 3 seed in the region, fell behind early by way of an offense built around missed layups and missed three-pointers. Lots of Red Raiders had off nights. Star guard Chance McMillian, who hasn’t played since suffering what he said was an oblique strain in the early rounds of the Big 12 tournament, didn’t even dress for the Arkansas game. Senior guard Elijah Hawkins played all 45 minutes for Tech, but went 0-9 from the field in regulation, including 0-6 from three. Kerwin Walton, who had eight threes while putting up a team- and career-high 27 points a week ago in Tech’s tournament-opening win over North Carolina-Wilmington, was benched early against Arkansas and finished with zero points.</span>

                              <span>You can never be all that surprised when a team reverts to type. Yes, Real Madrid was fresh on the heels of the best week in its short history, having sealed two huge, potentially fate-altering wins. Nevertheless, this is still Real Madrid—talented but bumbling, ineptly managed, devoid of ambition, and disappointing as a rule. If the shock Clásico victory over the weekend, and the preceding 2-0 home win in the first leg of the Champions League quarterfinal tie against Arsenal, made for Real&#x27;s Cinderella moment, then the opening whistle of Wednesday&#x27;s followup match in London marked the arrival of midnight. Alessia Russo and her teammates were ready with the sledgehammers.

                              <span>If you know only one thing about Drew Magary, it is that he went on the Food Network show Chopped and won. If you know just two things, that additional knowledge probably involves one of his many acclaimed books or his long and successful writing career. But if you know a third thing about Drew it is that Bob Mould is his favorite musician. It&#x27;s a good choice, and in my opinion one that tells you something about a person. Mould is a one-of-one, a trailblazer and a punk rock legend who has continued to make ambitious, socially conscious, and extremely loud music over the course of five decades in a business with a short memory and narrow margins. I like his music a lot, too, but the person I just described is someone that I would, just given my own deep-seated sense of suburban uncoolness, be inclined to admire from afar. Drew, who is different, has not just set out to Meet His Hero but to have him on the podcast. And so, for a second time, we welcomed back one of the coolest and most admirable Americans of his era onto the podcast where we otherwise say &quot;pee pee&quot; and &quot;poo poo&quot; back and forth to each other.</span>

                              <span>LeBron James went on ESPN Sunburn Lord Pat McAfee&#x27;s show on Wednesday; while there, he said some mostly anodyne stuff about Michael Jordan and talked a little about his sons Bronny and Bryce. The parts of the interview that achieved escape velocity, though, were comments James made about two other ESPN personalities: Stephen A. Smith and Brian Windhorst.
Smith and James have been feuding for a couple months now, with Smith identifying that the concerned uncle angle is the most likely to provoke a reaction and being proven broadly correct, as James confronted him on the court after beating the Knicks on Mar. 6. &quot;If it’s one person that couldn’t wait until the video had dropped so you could address it, it&#x27;s your ass. Like, seriously,&quot; James said, to McAfee, of his courtside confrontation. He allowed that criticism was fine up to a point, &quot;But when you take it and you get personal with it, it’s my job to not only protect my damn household but protect the players.&quot;</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s not always easy to determine if and when a team has quit on their coach. Observers of the Philadelphia Flyers have no such uncertainty. After allowing six unanswered goals in Toronto on Tuesday, Philly&#x27;s 7-2 defeat was their 11th in the past 12, and only a couple of those losses featured anything positive to build on. This is rock bottom.

                              <span>When Veronica Correa started college at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, she knew she wanted to pursue some kind of science, but traditional paths—such as medicine or research—didn&#x27;t feel right to her. She sampled different classes, at one point signing up for a class about water management and human rights to fulfill a philosophy requirement. This class helped Correa realize she wanted to enter the environmental field, which combined many disciplines.
Correa&#x27;s interest in science was both personal and familial. Her parents are originally from Venezuela, where her grandmother worked as a biologist studying tropical disease and teaching at a university. &quot;I always thought it was really admirable what she was doing, especially starting her career in the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s in a time in culture when there weren&#x27;t a lot of women pursuing her particular field,&quot; Correa said.</span>

And that is probably all the detail you need, because Rule The First of fantasy drafts remains in force, and that rule stipulates that you must keep your fantasy team to yourself. Your designated typist has been assured (and when we say &quot;assured,&quot; we mean &quot;threatened&quot;) that there is an exemption for fantasy leagues that predate the first appearance of a high-five on television.</span>

It&#x27;s not worth taking seriously on any level, with all due respect to the people who delivered it. Those people did their best, twice, which is the troubling part. You only get one chance to get a nickname right, and you can&#x27;t get it back no matter how many do-overs you ask the audience to allow in search of that one chance.
The new NWSL franchise in Boston has unveiled their official do-over after the hilarious yet horrific BOS Nation debacle, and credit where it’s due: they started well enough with their choice of Sharpie Highlighter Green as a team color. Green is an underused and therefore fine idea; the color has been an out-of-fashion athletic choice since organized sport began, on both sides of the gender, geographical, and even oceanic barriers, and even now green is used in barely 10 percent of the college and pro teams in the major sports. The praise sadly must end there.</span>

                              <span>I’m gonna tell you a dirty little secret about the Pittsburgh Steelers: they don’t care about winning another Super Bowl. They have a coach who can win nine games a year with just weeds and garbage, a name brand pass rusher whose jersey will keep selling long after he’s retired, and a full stadium every home game. That’s Steelers-y enough for the Rooney family. They don’t need anything more than that to be content. And that’s good, because they just lost their other starting quarterback from 2024.
While the New York Giants are putting the finishing touches on their three-headed Herb-erus of a QB room, the Steelers have opted to go in the opposite direction by doing nothing at all. The only QBs they currently have rostered are a pair of nobodies in Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson, and their highest pick in the upcoming draft is 21st. If this were any other organization—even the Titans!—there would be a giant red siren flashing over team headquarters, and the franchise’s scouting department would be urgently canvassing the nation to measure the hand side of every would-be quarterback out there. This is the NFL. You need a quarterback to live. I believe Itchy explicitly told Scratchy this once.</span>

                              <span>In 2018, I went to Pompeii. I did not particularly want to go to Pompeii, but we were on vacation in Italy, and my partner wanted to go, and so I obliged. We could eat in Naples, I reasoned. Then even if I did not have fun in the hot sun amongst the rocks and ruins of an ancient town, I would still be happy. But I was wrong; I enjoyed it. How do you not fawn over a perfectly preserved mosaic floor laid carefully in the entryway to a opulent home almost two thousand years ago? How can you not need to catch your breath at a still-standing arch that has been excavated from thousands of tons of debris that buried it after a volcano exploded?
The only thing I did not like about Pompeii—besides the heat—was that I was denied full access. There was a whole-ass vineyard behind some very high walls that I was not allowed to touch, and worse, whole sections of the city were still roped off because archeologists were still painstakingly uncovering them. I respect science, and understand that they need excavations to abide by certain rules to make sure that everything stays as unbroken as possible. But also I went to the wrong entrance of Pompeii and wandered around without a map, and saw the sections I was not allowed to enter and it pained me. I wanted to go back there! I felt the pull of curiosity. And now I know why: There was a glass brain.</span>

                              <span>Soccer in Spain is defined by the rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona. It&#x27;s what stirs Spanish hearts (one study found that some 57 percent of Spaniards support either Real or Barça), captivates the world&#x27;s imagination (El Clásico is hands down the biggest rivalry match on the planet), and therefore drives the attention, passion, and economics that are the lifeblood of the sport. What Spanish soccer is, it is in large part directly due to Real and Barça.
As should be evident by now, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sides of the sport are two inextricably linked aspects of the same entity. Much of the history of women&#x27;s soccer can be told by measuring the gap between the two at any given point in time, success always found in the places where the chasm wasn&#x27;t quite as wide as elsewhere. The future of the sport is in shrinking that margin further still.</span>

                              <span>William Kim’s TikTok videos should not be popular. They are long, sparsely edited, and lack music or text that might hold viewers’ attention. Most of his videos start with a defiant and absurd statement: “This is my food. My food is me.” His first video, posted on January 30, 2025, has almost six million views. 
I first saw one in early February, not long after the TikTok ban was temporarily reversed in the U.S. My feed tends to be full of fashion theory and celebrity gossip, so the minimal editing of Kim’s video felt distinct and interesting.</span>

                              <span>The race reports following each of the past 29 editions of the men&#x27;s Milan–San Remo, the first monument classic of the cycling season, are more or less identical, save for the proper nouns. The peloton races down from Milan onto the coast of the Ligurian Sea for like six hours and, after being softened up by all that racing through foreboding spring conditions and one ascent of the Cipressa around 20 kilometers from the line, the race is decided by the ascent and descent of the Poggio, a sinuous and otherwise unremarkable climb made totally decisive by all that softening up. Oddly, the race&#x27;s structural predictability (matched only by La Fleche Wallone) lends itself to an unpredictability of outcome. You never knew who will win, but you know how they will win.
That is, until this past weekend&#x27;s men&#x27;s race, which not only ended with Mathieu van der Poel repeating his 2023 triumph, but saw a wholly different kind of finish. It was the best Milan–San Remo I&#x27;ve seen in my time watching pro cycling, a testament to the greatness of both van der Poel and Tadej Pogacar, and the possibility of their rivalry.</span>

Surely next week we&#x27;ll have more eloquent things to say about this three-month journey into the heart of our creative souls. Or, perhaps, we will be so broken and filled with dread that even the promise of being among the proud few to actually complete the The Artist&#x27;s Way will not fill us with joy. For now we&#x27;re trying to get through the last few days of morning pages. 
Will this next week mark the beginning of our new lives as enlightened artists? Will one (or many) of us burn the book when we&#x27;re done? Will the next time you see us be on a Broadway stage? Only time will tell.</span>

                              <span>The funny thing about getting invested in the race for the wild card is that, by definition, none of the teams involved are very good. Montreal is improbably clinging to the last playoff spot in the East right now mostly because they&#x27;re not losing in regulation. The Islanders, with their minus-16 goal differential (better than Montreal&#x27;s!), are right behind them for similar reasons. The Rangers have lost seven of their last 10. The Blue Jackets just ended a six-game skid by squeaking one out against the Isles. And finally, before we reach the completely unsalvageable wreckage, we have the Detroit Red Wings, currently experiencing the comedown after the coaching-change hot streak that rocketed them back into relevancy around New Year&#x27;s.
The Wings, last among the not-good teams, are really not good. They tricked people into thinking they might be when they ripped off a couple of seven-game win streaks in close proximity, but this is a squad that still hasn&#x27;t found a goalie solution, has struggled to make smart veteran acquisitions, and is stuck waiting on talent development to usher in a turnaround. Since the end of the international break, they&#x27;ve plummeted down the standings, and entering Monday&#x27;s first-ever franchise trip to Utah they&#x27;d won just four of their last 14. Facing the Hockey Clubs—another group that badly needs to scrounge up some points to sneak into the playoffs—the Wings, honestly, turned in another poor performance. But despite barely getting the puck on net, a couple of silly/frustrating goals delivered them the worst-looking 5-1 victory I&#x27;ve ever seen.</span>

                              <span>Over the course of nearly a decade, Gisele Pelicot of Mazan, France, was drugged and raped by her husband and as many as 83 other men he invited to do so. Presented with the option to prosecute the case privately, Gisele instead insisted on a public trial. Sophie Smith writes in an essay for The London Review of Books: “Her hope – and in this she is not alone – is that by publicising the behaviour such a society produces, the trial will be a step towards changing it.” The accomplices of Gisele’s husband, Dominique, variously admitted their guilt or rejected the use of “rape” outright. Several men repeated the line, “I am not a rapist,” with added justifications that Gisele must have known what was happening, that it was all a game, that she actually wanted the encounter to happen. “Liar, slut, loudmouth, killjoy: as is often true of rape trials, the best defense is one able to transform the victim into a contemptible Medusa, to make of the accuser the accused,” writes Jamie Hood, author of the new memoir Trauma Plot, in a recent Bookforum review of Virginie Despentes’s novel Dear Dickhead that begins with Pelicot’s trial. 
In Trauma Plot, Hood delineates her experience surviving three rapes through a prismatic formal lens. Each chapter of the memoir switches from a first, second, or third-person perspective, charting Hood’s time in grad school in Boston and her subsequent relocation to Brooklyn, while also weaving in threads from her childhood. But time, in Hood’s hands, is anything but linear. Hood destabilizes what might be deemed the tidy story of rape and gendered violence, the narrative that claims narrative is even a suitable form with which to contain trauma. “Everywhere I went, rape followed. Rape was the little phrase repeated through the score of my life.”</span>

                              <span>Thanks to some serendipitous scheduling, Manchester City and Chelsea are three-quarters of the way through a four-game series that started on March 15 with the League Cup final. It will end this Thursday, with the second leg of a Champions League quarterfinal tie. So far, this is a series that&#x27;s shown us the best of what the WSL has to offer.
It takes high-quality players and high stakes to turn a quirk of the schedule into a season-defining series, and this one has loads of both. For Chelsea, the WSL&#x27;s undisputed hegemon, these games presented an opportunity not only to continue their pursuit of a multi-trophy season, but to put Manchester City back in its place. Chelsea has failed to win the WSL title just once in the last eight seasons, but were pushed to the brink by City last season, which ended with Chelsea claiming their fifth consecutive title, but only on goal difference. For City, these four games brought with them the opportunity to salvage what is a season gone awry. City currently sits fourth in the WSL table, having regressed so far from last season&#x27;s heights that they are 15 points behind Chelsea at the top of the table and seven points out of the Champions League places. And yet, 12 straight days spent as Chelsea&#x27;s biggest obstacle to completing the treble left plenty to play for.</span>

                              <span>The Los Angeles Lakers dropped a game to the Magic Monday night, 118–106, in Orlando. There are worse things. The Magic are experiencing a rare patch of reasonable health, and in an otherwise nearly lost regular season they&#x27;ve managed to hold their heads above water at their home arena. Losing stinks—Nuke LaLoosh would say it&#x27;s, like, worse than winning—but for the Lakers this is just a loss. Rub some dirt on it, I say.
Far more troubling was the home loss Saturday night to the Chicago Bulls. This was supposed to be a get-well game, with LeBron James returning to action following a seven-game absence to tend to a groin injury. The Bulls aren&#x27;t exactly food, having now won 10 of 15 to pull into the East&#x27;s ninth seed, but that&#x27;s a second- or third-rate basketball operation over there, on the precipice of another gruesome rebuild, and the Lakers think of themselves as contenders. With James returning, and in the final game of the last significant homestand of the season, and with designs on righting a recently wayward ship, you would expect the Lakers to make a statement against so measly a foe. Instead, the visitors summarily karate-chopped the Lakers&#x27; buttcheeks to hamburger, in a drubbing so severe that Bronny James was given almost seven minutes of supervised sandbox time (naturally he missed all four of his shot attempts). The guys who shredded the Lakers are just guys: Coby White put up 36 points on 17 shots; Josh Giddey came two steals shy of a goddamn quadruple-double, and posted 17 assists to just two turnovers. Matas Buzelis (in fairness, he might someday become more than a guy) went for a career-high 31 points.</span>

                              <span>George Foreman could take a punch. 
Foreman, who died Friday at his home in Houston, was better known for other things. Like, most obviously, throwing a punch. He’s remembered as one of the hellaciousest hitters the sweet science ever saw, and his ring record (76-5 with 68 knockouts) and lots of YouTube highlights bolster that. The uninitiated can and should watch him seemingly lift Joe Frazier off the ground with a shot in 1973, or send former great white hope Gerry Cooney into retirement for good some 17 years later, or transport Michael Moorer to LaLa Land in late 1994. And outside the squared circle, Foreman famously shilled no-frills grills, and named all five of his sons George.</span>

                              <span>JuJu Watkins will miss the rest of the NCAA tournament with an injury she sustained in USC’s second-round game against Mississippi State, the team announced late Monday night. ESPN’s Shams Charania reported that the sophomore guard tore her ACL in her right knee. 
Watkins was carried off the floor by trainers just five minutes into Monday night’s game. To fans of Watkins, the sequence before the injury might have looked familiar. Her transition burst, and her rarer ability to change pace—to decelerate—make her one of the best players in college basketball. On a fast break in the first quarter, she seemed ready to bring both skills to bear against two defenders. But as the Bulldogs players caught up to her on the other end of the court, and as she tried to stop and swerve around them, Watkins fell and screamed in pain.</span>

                              <span>Chinook salmon start their lives high upstream in the rivers of western North America. The young fish linger in the safety of freshwater until they are big enough to head out into the open ocean, where they can live for up to five years. At sea, the salmon shine blue-green and glint silver. When the fish head back upriver, however, they flush into warmer hues: olive browns, reds, and purples. The jaws of the males lengthen and hook. The salmon almost always return to the exact stream in which they were born, following the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field like a compass. There, the salmon meet, mate, and prepare to die.
At this stage of the salmon&#x27;s life, they become &quot;gruesome zombie fish,&quot; said Sara Hugentobler, a fish biologist who worked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the hatchery evaluation program in Red Bluff, Calif. &quot;They&#x27;re losing scales. They&#x27;re losing tissue. You can see exposed bone.&quot; But this orgy of death leaves behind a bounty of carcasses—a buffet for bears and other scavengers. And whatever flesh, bone, and scales remain sink to the riverbed and become fertilizer for more life. &quot;They&#x27;re a really important ecological part of the environment,&quot; Hugentobler said.</span>

They’re still out there, but they’ve become minor players thanks to the revolution that followed players winning the right to get paid and transfer from program to program—only a nonagenarian or certified delusional still refers to them as &quot;schools&quot; in this context—until they get the fit or payday they want. In this new order, the general managers and athletic directors who make sure those payments come on time have taken over the top of the perception food chain; for every Tom Izzo, Rick Barnes, or Matt Painter, there is an army of younger, more mobile, and less martinet-ish new guys who lead with the smooth for the new generation of employees—less coaches than managers.
Fortunately, though, there is still Dan Hurley to corner the tantrum market.</span>

                              <span>My son was on a mission. Simon has been walking since December, and he’s getting more confident each day. He’d spotted something, and was scooting down the aisle as fast as he could towards it. He wanted to play in the clothing racks.
They were empty. The store was full of people, but all that remained was plus-size women’s clothing priced at 3-for-$5. Even most of the mannequins had been purchased; rental trucks idled outside as buyers loaded them up with fixtures from the store. Philadelphia’s flagship Macy’s was closing; signs declared it the “final few hours.” I was there with my son, my wife, and my parents. Some guy was riding his bike through the store, which is about when we figured it was OK to let Simon run around. After spending some time entranced by a jewelry case, he found the clothing racks.</span>

                              <span>Back in the late 2010s, my wife and I took our kids to Los Angeles for spring break. Being the good little tourist family that we were, we used the occasion to visit Universal Studios Hollywood, which included a Wizarding World of Harry Potter sub-park at its far end. This was back when my kids found Harry Potter interesting, and right as Potter author J.K. Rowling was committing herself to becoming a culture warrior of the most tiresome sort. We enjoyed all of the magical offerings that Potterworld had on display. The virtual roller coaster (Universal has a lot of them). The actual roller coaster (underwhelming). Ollivanders Wand Shop (endless line for what was ultimately just a gift shop). It was a good time, but hardly a memorable one. What was memorable, however, was the butterbeer.
If you know your Potter lore, and I do to a casual extent, you know that butterbeer was served at the pub in the town of Hogsmeade. I loved beer, and I loved butter, so the second that I saw the word “butterbeer” in the books, I wanted one. I could taste it just by staring at that word for seconds at a time: thick, foamy, sweet like butterscotch. When I’d finished the entire Potter saga, the desire hadn’t abated a whit. I said to myself, “Fuck me, I’d love to drink a butterbeer.”</span>

Yes, there&#x27;s a new Max Muncy in town. This one is a middle infielder, is 22 years old, and was a first-round pick in 2021. He&#x27;s listed as the organization&#x27;s No. 7 prospect mostly thanks to his stellar defense, and he&#x27;s got a little bit of pop in his bat. Max Muncy is not to be confused with Max Muncy, the 34-year-old Dodgers corner infielder. Two totally different guys! Even though both were drafted by the Athletics, and both have August 25 birthdays.</span>

                              <span>No baseball reporter delivers the goods as consistently as USA Today&#x27;s Bob Nightengale, by which I mean nobody else in his field possesses even one percent of his ability to make dispassionately tweeting news and information related to Major League Baseball a constant struggle. Bob attempting to break free agency news? A riot. Bob confidently sharing photos that look like they were taken from inside of a vaseline jar? Always kills. Bob just inventing and then getting really hung up on the idea of the $10 Million Club? I laughed all day.
On Sunday, Bob struck again. While everyone was just trying to relax and watch some college basketball, Bob attempted to share a heartfelt message about the death of sports columnist Bryce Miller. Instead, he briefly sent the entire city of Philadelphia into a panic:</span>

                              <span>A one-possession NCAA tournament game with seconds on the clock can induce as much dread as anticipation. For as often as situations like these produce iconic buzzer-beaters, they just as often fall victim to college basketball&#x27;s inherent jankiness—subpar coaches drawing up doomed sets and skittish players momentarily forgetting which direction their basket is. It&#x27;s a blessing to get one great shot out of a scenario like this; on Sunday night, Colorado State and Maryland gave us two.
The teams that successfully navigate these moments tend to be the ones that have a good idea of who they are and what they want to do. After Maryland&#x27;s Julian Reese hit two free throws to give his team a 70-68 lead with 22 seconds left, CSU head coach Niko Medved didn&#x27;t like what he saw as his team raced up the floor and struggled to get into an offensive set. He called a timeout with 12 seconds left, and while the Rams huddled up, there was no doubt who would be getting the ball on the next possession.</span>

                              <span>First, the apologetics. Barbecue sauce is not a necessity—not even and maybe especially not even to the making of good barbecue, but also just in general: You do not really ever need barbecue sauce, except perhaps where you expect the meat clad in it to come out otherwise dry or bland or underwhelming, and you can and should expect more of your barbecue efforts than to assume their products will need this help.
Now let&#x27;s drive back in the other direction a little bit. Barbecue sauce is fine! It tastes good and it&#x27;s fun, and making it is easy, and even excellent barbecue certainly isn&#x27;t harmed by the option of drizzling or brushing it with something tart and sweet and hot and sticky. If barbecue sauce is not a need-to-have type of thing, then it is for sure a nice-to-have type of thing.</span>

When I texted my roommate, &quot;what if we became board game people...&quot; I didn&#x27;t think it would come to this: two board games purchased to start and then, a week later, two more on the way and an all-consuming obsession with Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 that has resulted in playing 13 games in a little over a week. There is a lesson to be learned here about YouTube rabbit holes that see you watching hours of British men reviewing board games, but it&#x27;s already too late to interrogate.</span>

                              <span>If last year was any indication, two races is far too early to bang the gavel on Championship domination—but for structure&#x27;s sake, let&#x27;s save McLaren for last anyway. The Chinese Grand Prix is one of six sprint race weekends on the calendar this year, and in typical fashion, the sprint spoiled the contours of the feature race, if not the final results—a newly repaved tarmac that grinds through medium compound tires, combined with a track that makes for difficult passing without significant tire advantage. Then, Lewis Hamilton demonstrated some much-needed dominance for Ferrari, converting a sprint-qualifying pole into a tire-management masterclass until the end; there was even a vintage tire complaint over the radio before he pulled away from the rest of the field.
In typical Ferrari fashion, the good signs did not last very long. Whatever setup tweaks were made between the sprint race and qualifying proved a disaster. The race itself provided a laundry list of misfortunes. Neither Hamilton nor Charles Leclerc impressed in qualifying, while Oscar Piastri took his first pole in Formula 1. On the first lap of the race, Hamilton and Leclerc made contact as both cars passed Max Verstappen&#x27;s Red Bull, damaging Leclerc&#x27;s front wing. (One lucky break: The damaged wing barely affected Leclerc&#x27;s pace.) Later, Hamilton, unable to find the pace in the car, suggested a driver swap to his race engineer.</span>

                              <span>The entire production of KiiiKiii&#x27;s &quot;Debut Song&quot; reeks of maliciousness, or maybe that&#x27;s just a kneejerk reaction to watching the K-pop machinery discover irony. To start, &quot;Debut Song&quot; is not actually a debut song; it is a &quot;pre-release single,&quot; or additional promotional material that happens to come in the form of a song, as part of a prolonged rollout before the group&#x27;s official launch. KiiiKiii—that’s three i&#x27;s, twice—started promotions on February 24 and will only officially debut a month later on March 24. Both &quot;Debut Song&quot; and its music video aren&#x27;t meant to be taken very seriously. It&#x27;s a referential satire on the industry; it&#x27;s all in good fun.
