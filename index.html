                              <span>During matchweeks 13 and 14 of the season, the Premier League partners with LGBT charity Stonewall for Rainbow Laces, a campaign to promote LGBT acceptance in soccer, both on the field and in the stands. In practice, this entails some minor cosmetic changes around England&#x27;s top flight. The league provides clubs with rainbow corner flags, ball plinths, as well as handshake and substitute boards. Most notably, club captains during these games are given the option to wear a rainbow-colored armband, which they are free to decline. This is very much a bare minimum campaign by the Premier League, and one that it has backed away from somewhat; per The Athletic, the league cut the funding of its partnership with Stonewall by about half last December.
However, even the bare minimum is too much for some, which brings us to Crystal Palace captain and England international Marc Guéhi. During Saturday&#x27;s home match against Newcastle United, which ended in a 1-1 draw, Guéhi wore a rainbow armband that had &quot;I ♡ Jesus&quot; written on it in marker (pictured above). In Palace&#x27;s next game, a 1-0 away win against Ipswich Town, Guéhi once again wore the rainbow armband, this time with &quot;Jesus ♡ You&quot; written on it.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve spent the early chunk of this NHL season disproportionately watching underachieving Eastern Conference teams play listless hockey in front of crowds that seem barely engaged. So the Minnesota Wild&#x27;s Tuesday night overtime win over the Canucks, against the backdrop of a lively lower bowl, was hockey heaven. Down 2-1 to start the third, a team that missed the playoffs last season and hasn&#x27;t won a series since 2015 improved upon the league&#x27;s best record with an equalizer from their big D-man and a last-minute game-winner from possibly the most exciting skater in the sport today. The intensity may not truly start until the new year, but this was as good as early December gets.
The first-period action started a little tentatively, but the Canucks used a power play to their advantage when a Quinn Hughes shot whizzed through traffic to get them on the board. The Wild found their response with a fast-break three-on-one goal off a turnover in the second, but Vancouver stole back momentum just before intermission when newly acquired scoring leader Jake DeBrusk tapped in a rebound.</span>

                              <span>My grandparents held grudges so well and so thoroughly that in the aftermath of drama, everyone knew the drill: the offending person or subject was no longer to be mentioned. This is obviously unfortunate. Lore and venting instead spread outward from each person to their own webs of acquaintances, but within the family, drama became taboo. This is neither healthy nor productive for nosy little punks like me. Fortunately for gossips everywhere, some families chatter a lot. Some even consult fortune tellers for life advice. Others simply deal with forbidden subjects in the the good ol&#x27; way: lying.
For the penultimate episode of season seven, prepare yourselves for a huge family lore drop. We&#x27;re going One Hundred Years of Solitude mode. This is a good reminder to us all that you don’t get to be old without collecting a lifetime’s worth of secrets along the way.</span>

                              <span>There was a great sequence late in the second quarter of Tuesday night&#x27;s NBA Cup match between the Orlando Magic and the New York Knicks. Great for a neutral viewer, certainly great if you are a Knicks fan. Less great if you are the fan of the Orlando Magic, but still pretty fun! The Knicks were pulling away from the Magic, up 21 points at about the three-minute mark, and Magic head coach Jamahl Mosley put Moritz Wagner into the game. I assume this substitution was scheduled, but it was also appropriate to the specific moment: the offensive gravity of Knicks center Karl-Anthony Towns was tugging Magic counterpart Wendell Carter Jr. all over the court and largely negating his defensive value, and the Magic were badly losing Carter&#x27;s minutes. Moe is a change-of-pace type of player, both because he exemplifies try-harderism and because he is happy to play the pest and work his way under an opponent&#x27;s skin. And Mosley needed someone to upset the rhythm of the game: This may have been an early-December contest but the depleted Magic needed to manage the final margin in order to advance in the tournament, a dynamic that juiced up the competition all the way to the final buzzer.
Wagner came on, worked a dribble hand-off with his brother Franz, then immediately re-screened Franz&#x27;s defender and chugged into the paint, where he received a slick feed on the go and banked in a quick layup. The set had some nice flowing Wagner-to-Wagner chemistry, and Towns, who&#x27;d been exploited by the quick screens and darting action, seemed slightly annoyed. Seconds later, on the Knicks&#x27; ensuing possession, Towns made himself a little too angular setting an off-ball screen on the wing and wiped out Franz, earning an offensive foul. Again Towns seemed annoyed. The Moe Wagner Gambit was already showing signs of promise.</span>

                              <span>In The Game Behind The Game, his account of televising major sports events at ABC and at CBS, veteran TV sports producer Terry O’Neil writes about coming over to CBS and confronting a broadcasting culture that had pickled itself into a coma decades before. Apparently, the drinking culture at CBS Sports was even more widespread than that which O’Neil experienced working at ABC with Howard Cosell. This was plain even to the casual viewer at home, whose holiday viewing was spiced up annually by the Sun Bowl broadcast from El Paso during which Pat Summerall and Tom Brookshier regularly discussed how sockless they’d gotten themselves in Juarez the night before.
One of the non-alcoholic symptoms of stultification at CBS was the stubborn refusal to move its in-game cameras from their positions on the 50-yard line. ABC, as O’Neil points out, had long ago moved cameras to the 25-yard lines, as well as leaving one at the 50. This enabled ABC to show more football during its football telecasts which, for TV executives, was akin to perfecting nuclear fusion. But, as O’Neil remembers it, the issue almost came to guns and knives at CBS. People there actually made the argument that, at the 50, CBS had “the best seat in the house.” This sounded to O’Neil like they were bragging about cracking the technology of television three days before air.</span>

So you reach down to your belt, pull out a tiny silver spoon, and scoop up a tiny mound of powder, and take a snort. Suddenly, you feel extremely ready to go back out there; &quot;out there&quot; meaning the misted marshes of Northern Europe during the Roman Period, and rejoin your buddies, meaning the other Germanic warriors that have gathered today for battle. Sure, you might be brutally dismembered, but at least you&#x27;re going out on a high?
This was the conclusion of a paper published recently in the German journal Praehistorische Zeitschrift, in which archaeologists analyzed 241 tiny spoons found buried in what is now Germany, Scandinavia, and Poland, along with items of warfare from the Roman Period, and concluded the warriors must have been bumpin&#x27; that.</span>

It is true that Jameis is a singular entity in the insurance company world of the National Football League, from the way he enters games to what he does during them and on the post-game podium afterwards. He has as much fun doing superoptimal things on a suboptimal team as any quarterback has since Bobby Layne quarterbacked the Detroit Lions and Pittsburgh Steelers while largely hung over throughout the 1950s. Plus, Layne didn&#x27;t wear a facemask and still got to the Hall of Fame, and what&#x27;s more fun than that?</span>

                              <span>In the winter of 2015, David Lovelace, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Geology Museum, remembered a rock the size of a soccer ball that had been sitting on a shelf in his lab for months. He&#x27;d collected it the previous year, walking back to his car after a day of searching for fossils. It contained a small burrow, barely four inches long. He wanted to extract the burrow. &quot;Being a good geologist, I hit the whole thing with my hammer,&quot; Lovelace said.
Unfortunately, the strike did not free the burrow, but it did reveal the skull of a small animal that had died inside. The tapered snout of the skull appeared crocodilian. But as Lovelace glued the bones back together and prepared the fossil, he realized it was actually an amphibian. Its skull had small pits and ridges characteristic of early amphibians, as well as grooves indicating a lateral line organ. Another strike of the rock revealed another skull and partial skeleton of the same kind of animal. Lovelace and his colleagues recently reported on this new species, a burrowing amphibian, Ninumbeehan dookoodukah, in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.</span>

                              <span>UMass and UConn were all set up for the big one. The two programs played 77 times before, but this was the first time that a trophy sponsored by an NIL collective would be on the line. Sure, UConn was 7-4 coming into the game and UMass was 2-9. But with UMass moving to the MAC next season, it might be the last time these two teams played for a while. And there was a brand new trophy to fight for. This had all the makings of a classic.
Players were aware of the significance. “I did see it on social media,” UConn offensive lineman Chase Lundt, a sixth-year senior, told the Hartford Courant about the trophy. “Pretty neat. It would be cool if we could get something like that.”</span>

The scrap escalated until both parties started to laugh—a wholesome incident between Team Canada pals. On most teams, Brooks&#x27;s defensive intensity would be an anomaly, and yet he might not even be the second-most aggressive defender on the Rockets&#x27; roster.

                              <span>I hate to say it, but the biggest laugh in James Acaster’s new special, Hecklers Welcome, comes from a heckle. Obviously. The show opens with the British comic naming his house rules, which amount to allowing all forms of audience disruption (except if it’s, you know, actually offensive). Anyone who knows Acaster—I know him from his very popular food podcast, Off Menu, which he co-hosts with fellow comedian Ed Gamble—knows he hates a heckle, so to build an entire show around it is kind of a big move. Being the pro writer that he is, the start of the show is a rundown of the various formative heckles of his career, the first of which arrived very early on during what he calls the worst gig he’s ever done. “Does your mother know you’re up this late?” was the trigger, to which a young Acaster apparently responded that his mother was dead (she wasn’t)—and that she had died really recently. Which silenced the heckler, obviously. As well as the rest of the audience, for the entire show.
Fast-forward about 30 minutes into this latest special, and the punchline to another Acaster joke is a guy yelling to a bunch of bullies that their parents don’t love them. To which one audience member pipes up: “My parents are dead!” Acaster is so impressed by the callback that he says: “Lovely to have a heckler in here who appreciates structure.” But then a few moments later, another audience member adds: “...by suicide.” Acaster asks his name (it’s Richard, because this is England). Then Acaster says, completely deadpan: “Richard, what is wrong with you, mate?”</span>

                              <span>This is the time of year when the best, biggest, and most ambitious movies come out. Not Oscar season, but rather that stretch when the halls of streaming services are decked with the brightly lit, thinly disguised advertisements that are the year&#x27;s new Christmas movies. There are more than 100 new Christmas films to watch this holiday season, and whether that number horrifies or excites you depends upon how much of a freak you are for the festive. Sabrina is proud to say they are a real Christmas freak, and this year they asked some of their colleagues to watch some of the most, uh, available new holiday movies. The third movie in our lineup is &#x27;Tis the Season to Be Irish, a Hallmark movie that dares to ask, &quot;What&#x27;s the Gaelic word for house-flipping?&quot; This week, we are joined by an extra special guest: Leigh McKenna.
Leigh McKenna: This is Leigh. I&#x27;m on here.</span>

                              <span>At the time of writing, on Dec. 2, 2024, Liverpool is nine points clear at the top of the Premier League table. The Pool Boys have been in torrid form domestically this season: 11 wins, one draw to second-place Arsenal, and one less-shocking-by-the-day loss to sixth-place Nottingham Forest. That run of 13 games includes wins over third-place Chelsea, fourth-place Brighton, and an always-pleasant thrashing of rival Manchester United. As of Sunday, it also includes a quite comfortable 2-0 victory over Manchester City, a club in full-blown crisis, insomuch as the Sky Blues can be in crisis; the loss to Liverpool threw City into fifth place, and the reigning champions have not won in seven matches across all competitions.

                              <span>The theory of the dribble handoff is sound: The hub, typically a center brutish enough to dislodge trailing defenders with a screen but adept enough with the rock to make quick passing decisions, scrambles typical pick-and-roll coverage by simultaneously acting as both ball-handler and screener. With a live dribble, they have the latitude to punish overzealous help defense and dictate the angle of the screen. The player coming around the DHO can either pop into open space or attack a slightly shifted defense, with the hub either rolling or popping themselves. 
One NBA team, Sacramento, has made the DHO the foundation of its half-court offense. This made total sense when the Kings implemented the system two seasons ago and won 48 games; it also helps explain why the team is currently drawing dead in a conference that has passed them by.</span>

                              <span>You&#x27;d think it would get old by now, but it really hasn&#x27;t: It&#x27;s almost therapeutic to watch Aaron Rodgers eat shit week after week. The preceding months of smugness, sneers, and hack pop-culture references just enhance the results, and in a stroke of serendipity, today is Aaron Rodgers&#x27;s 41st birthday. Hey—happy birthday, big guy. You don&#x27;t play a day over 65.</span>

                              <span>Justin Tucker sat encased in a sideline cape and hidden under a hood, alone with his thoughts and the millions of other people thinking them. He had just missed a 53-yard field goal that would have put the Baltimore Ravens ahead of the Philadelphia Eagles, and Tucker looked more than just morose. He looked even more than baffled. The most productive NFL kicker of the last decade looked like the living embodiment of a yip.
People speak of the yips often, usually in relation to a golfer with putting issues; for whatever it may be worth, the Oxford English Dictionary pegs the first use of the term as having been in 1935, in American Golfer. Everyone agrees on what it is: the sudden inability to perform a task one has performed many times before because the one performing the task is thinking too hard about the task itself and becoming overwhelmed by the very idea. It’s less that the task becomes more difficult and more that it just slips further and further out of perspective.</span>

                              <span>On Saturday, the San Jose State women&#x27;s volleyball season came to an end, as the Spartans were beaten in four sets by the Colorado State Rams in the Mountain West Conference championship. A top seed comfortably prevailing over a second seed in a small conference tournament final is not a particularly remarkable or noteworthy outcome, but SJSU&#x27;s tournament run gained national attention thanks to the hard work of people who hate sports almost as much as they hate transgender people.
Last week, ESPN&#x27;s Katie Barnes published a long and deeply reported story about SJSU&#x27;s volleyball season, which I highly recommend you read. The short version is that earlier this year an anti-trans activist group called Independent Council on Women&#x27;s Sports (ICONS) and professional bigot Riley Gaines trained their sights on SJSU&#x27;s volleyball team, claiming that the team has a transgender player. (The player in question has not been named in non-reactionary media coverage.) In March, ICONS and Gaines filed a lawsuit against the NCAA seeking to overturn the policies that allow transgender athletes to play sports. In September, SJSU co-captain Brooke Slusser joined the lawsuit, claiming that the presence of a transgender player on her team posed a safety risk to her teammates and opponents.</span>

The dry season snuffs out the poker&#x27;s flowers, leaving the plant parched and yellow. But in the rainy season, the plants first regrow their spiky leaves, then their towering stem, and finally their red-hot flowers. &quot;They look like hundreds of fire torches covering the landscape,&quot; Sandra Lai, a senior scientist at Oxford University&#x27;s Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Program, or EWCP, wrote in an email.</span>

The Browns&#x27; offices in Berea are on Lou Groza Boulevard. There are parks named for Luke Easter, a Negro Leagues slugger who played for the Indians, and Mel Harder, a longtime pitcher and coach. (Harder&#x27;s park is also his final resting place. His ashes were scattered there following his death in 2002.)
But Cleveland immortalizes its sports villains, too. Art Modell has an Ohio law named for him.</span>

                              <span>The Washington Wizards started the season at a plucky 2-2. Perhaps that was pluckier than they intended. They proceeded to lose all 14 games they played in November, settling in the muck at a league-worst 2-16. This would be bleak new territory for most teams, but incredibly, this is not even the franchise&#x27;s first winless month in the current calendar year. Last season&#x27;s Wizards went 0-12 in February. That was part of a larger 16-game losing streak, tied for the worst in franchise history. Should the current Wizards lose three more games—and, given that the opponents are the Cavs, Mavs, and Nuggets, they might—they would claim that franchise record instead.
Another astonishing aspect is how uncompetitive the games themselves have been. The Wizards lost all 14 games in this streak by a margin of at least nine points, which had never been accomplished in NBA history. In 10 of those games, they were blown out by at least 15 points. The team is omni-directionally bad, with both the league&#x27;s worst offensive rating and the worst defensive rating and, as such, the worst net rating, a gruesome -14.1.</span>

                              <span>Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence left Sunday&#x27;s game on a medical cart after Houston Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair hit the QB while he was sliding, appearing to lead with his forearm and helmet. The smack of the tackle could be heard on TV.
Lawrence lay motionless on the field in what looked like a fencing response. But it was hard to see all of Lawrence&#x27;s body because, almost immediately, a fight broke out. After Al-Shaair made the tackle, Jaguars tight end Evan Engram rushed over and shoved him, and players from both teams escalated the clash. At one point, the broadcast showed a huge swath of players on one sideline as the fight wound down while, further away, a handful of personnel tended to Lawrence. ESPN&#x27;s Michael DiRocco reported that &quot;an official knelt to protect Lawrence as the skirmish moved toward the Jaguars sideline.&quot;</span>

                              <span>For the second time in 2024, one of the best tennis players in the world has violated anti-doping rules. The International Tennis Integrity Agency announced Thursday that Iga Swiatek, currently the world No. 2, tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine, a heart medication used in Europe and Asia to treat angina. It was detected in an out-of-competition test Swiatek provided just ahead of the Cincinnati Open in August, the ITIA said. Swiatek formally admitted to the anti-doping rules violation and accepted a one-month ban from the sport; her three weeks of provisional suspension earlier in the year count toward that ban and she is currently serving the remaining eight days during a meaningless stretch of the tennis calendar. She was also stripped of $158,944 in prize money and 390 ranking points for her semifinal run in Cincinnati.
Swiatek previously had a provisional suspension as she sought to explain the source of the trimetazidine to the ITIA. While doing so, she missed tournaments in Seoul, Beijing, and Wuhan in September and October. Swiatek was able to have her suite of at least 14 supplements analyzed to identify a possible source of contamination. She concluded that the culprit was her melatonin, which Swiatek has long used, she said, because with &quot;all my traveling, jet lag and work-related stress mean that sometimes without it, I couldn’t fall asleep.&quot; She provided both an opened and unopened containers of the melatonin to the ITIA, which had them analyzed and found the contamination consistent with the trace amounts of trimetazidine detected in Swiatek&#x27;s urine sample. Her provisional suspension was lifted and she was able to continue competing at the WTA&#x27;s year-end finals, per the ITIA decision.</span>

                              <span>Michigan beat Ohio State on Saturday for the fourth season in a row. The win gave this year&#x27;s senior class at Michigan a clean sweep over their longtime Buckeye rivals, and it was a stunning upset as OSU hosted the game and came into it ranked second in the country. Sure, college players are increasingly transferring between programs and extending their careers into their mid-twenties, but facts like that mean little next to the emotions of a longstanding rivalry that goes back more than a century. The most important fact of all is that Ohio State and Michigan hate each other. When the Wolverines won in Columbus, 13-10, and a player tried to plant a Michigan flag on the field, a brawl unsurprisingly followed.
Reporters were already on the field when the fight broke out, and Nicole Shearin of WBNS got video of what happened. The Michigan player, carrying a Michigan flag on a pole, walked up to an area of the field and motioned as if to plant the flag. He was slowed down, first by what looked like people in Ohio State clothing, followed by someone in Michigan clothing who put his arms around the player. The Michigan player wasn&#x27;t able to plant the flag, but kept talking as Ohio State athletes filled up the area. Video from another angle by UMGoBlue showed that after the failed flag planting, an Ohio State player grabbed the cloth part of the Michigan flag and ripped it off its pole. In the videos, this is when the fight started. (A different video also showed former Wolverine turned broadcaster Jason Avant securing the loose Michigan flag, but it&#x27;s hard to tell when that happened relative to everything else.)</span>
