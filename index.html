                              <span>Gerrit Cole is, by many people&#x27;s standards, not likable. I find this way of thinking to be incorrect because I like Gerrit Cole, though in a way that&#x27;s not always contingent on his continued success. He&#x27;s a guy with a dad comportment who is very invested in labor and the MLB Players Association. He&#x27;s one of the best pitchers of his generation. He is often one of the most informative pitchers to listen to talk after a start, especially a poor one. He sounds a bit like Kermit the Frog? His 2021 spider tack era proved so fascinating to me that I got in the graph mines for my own satisfaction.
This is not to say that I don&#x27;t derive joy from his successful starts, it&#x27;s just that it is not the only part of what defines a satisfying Cole game. To me, he remains narratively interesting as a hyper-competitive guy who has gone through ups and downs in recent years. It&#x27;s hard to begrudge anyone their disaffection—he can be a bit of a heel on the field, but he&#x27;s a well-constructed one who&#x27;s generally chill off of it, and, most importantly, has a fatal flaw: Rafael Devers.</span>

                              <span>If Lando Norris wanted a defense for his pole-to-win conversion rate in 2024, he can point to Charles Leclerc. Leclerc has gotten every single pole at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix since 2021, including this year&#x27;s, and has converted none of them. Baku was Leclerc&#x27;s race to lose on Sunday, and lose it he did, though not through the traditional Ferrari methodology of engine explosions, egregious strategy calls, or things of that nature. The race was a war of attrition that was, somehow, still won by the first pit stop.
But for all the pre-race chitter chatter about McLaren favoring Norris in team orders, a disastrous qualifying performance meant that Norris&#x27;s chances at a win were infinitesimally low. Instead, it was his teammate, Oscar Piastri, who started P2. Leclerc pulled off the line cleanly, and quickly built a six-second gap to Piastri. But with the medium tires degrading quickly, the undercut became extremely powerful. Sergio Pérez—who, in spite of a horrible 2024, could be a zombie and still get a podium finish at Baku—was the earliest frontrunner to pit. He came out just behind Norris, who started P15 and was accordingly running a different strategy.</span>

Maybe the recent, increasingly loud din made amongst adventurous music fans in the West about Brazilian funk isn&#x27;t your first introduction to it. Maybe you once downloaded those old Diplo funk compilations that came out a couple decades ago (boy, time flies!), from one of his many excursions out Daniel Plainviewing for a new sound to rip off. But maybe you didn&#x27;t really give those comps much attention, easy as they were to lose in your ever-ballooning music library (shoutout to Megaupload!), and your only subsequent interactions with contemporary South American music were from passing references or short clips when a Brazilian soccer player would get ahold of the locker room&#x27;s aux cord (do the kids still use those?) and put his teammates to shame with his dancing skills.</span>

                              <span>Cinema tells us that when a batter steps into the box and the catcher proceeds to tell him which pitch is coming, the catcher may be doing this for one of many reasons. It might have nothing to do with the batter; the catcher could be teaching his hotshot flamethrower not to shake off his elders. It might have everything to do with the batter; perhaps he is Michael Jordan. Some pitches are so good they can be fired past anyone, even a slugger who knows what&#x27;s on the way. 
A new report from ESPN&#x27;s Jeff Passan and Kiley McDaniel says none of these can explain a recent game between the Lakeland Flying Tigers and the Fort Myers Mighty Mussels, Low-A affiliates of the Tigers and Twins. In the second game of a Sept. 6 doubleheader, one the Mighty Mussels needed to win to stay in the Florida State League playoff race, Flying Tigers batters were puzzled to hear 21-year-old Mussels catcher Derek Bender telling them which pitches starter Ross Dunn was about to throw.</span>

                              <span>The continuing assault by university administrators upon elementary school teaching standards advanced another step this week with the latest burst of math, furniture, and geography rearrangement in college sports. The Pacific 12 Conference, which began as the Pac 8 then went to a membership of 10, and then 12, and then worryingly down to two, is now back up to six, only five of which cannot see the ocean after which the conference is named. As a result of that conference’s raid on its own ranks, the Mountain West is now slightly less mountainous and notably less western. If all pundit-based guesstimates are right it will be even less of both by Hallowe&#x27;en. 
Because this is American athletic culture in the third decade of the 2000s, it both fits and is essential that one of those candidates for re-re-re-location is based in, wait for it, Las Vegas.</span>

Visiting their website, I felt like I’d stumbled across a standard conservation group, or maybe a slightly pretentious yoga studio. There were pleasant, neutral-colored serif fonts, a looping video of moss and trees and sunlight breaking through a forest canopy and people happily trudging through the undergrowth in slow motion. The vibe isn’t death so much as what death might yield: greenery, abundance…</span>

                              <span>It wasn&#x27;t even a particularly crazy hit that did it. Tua Tagovailoa was scrambling, so committed to converting a fourth down that he never thought of sliding. Instead he lunged forward, his helmet making contact with Damar Hamlin&#x27;s forearm, and then banging the back of his head on the turf. A normal football play. But normal football plays involve very strong men moving very fast, and Tagovailoa&#x27;s brain, having suffered officially three previous concussions and in reality more than that, is especially susceptible to another one. 
There was a time not all that long ago, when I started blogging, when I&#x27;d need to explain the fencing response: what it is, what it means. Not anymore. Football fans have seen it too many times—we&#x27;ve seen him do it too many times—while somber broadcasters cut to a commercial as the network&#x27;s minor-key injury music plays. Tagovailoa instantly performed the fencing response after being tackled, and no one needed further explanation. Not again.</span>

                              <span>There was no way we were going to win this seagull. It was the second time I’d put a buck into the claw machine, attempting to win a little stuffed seagull with a french fry in its mouth. My dad had an idea. “Go for this one,” he said, pointing to one in front.
With Drew McQuade’s 73-year-old vision and Dan McQuade’s 41-year-old hand-eye coordination, and with claw machines being what they are, the odds were against us. I moved to the spot he picked, and it quickly became clear that his vision outpaced my coordination. I missed it by a lot and started laughing, and then he did.</span>
