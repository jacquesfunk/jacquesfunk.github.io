With two minutes left in the fourth quarter of Sunday&#x27;s game against the visiting Connecticut Sun, Wilson popped out to the perimeter to receive an entry pass from Jackie Young. Despite intense pressure from Brionna Jones, Wilson corralled the pass, took two hard dribbles toward the elbow with her off hand, and pulled up to cash the 11-foot leaning jumper right before DeWanna Bonner&#x27;s help from the strong side could alter the shot.

More than that, there&#x27;s no sense in searching for a justification when the people involved know that they are doing something that can&#x27;t be justified. That is more or less why they&#x27;re doing it, and any supposed tactical advantage should be understood as secondary to the primary purpose, which is to see what they can get away with, and to begin seeking permission in earnest for something that is (probably) still impermissible.
There was surely some calculation in J.D…</span>

The exception, here, is your peripatetic author, who long ago eschewed traditional (read: obnoxious) forms of fandom for both personal and professional reasons.

                              <span>In addition to running the pig skin the main job of an NFL analyst is scouting. For me that means watching &quot;NFL&quot; Hard Knocks, a show that goes inside the mind of the competition. This year &quot;NFL&quot; Hard Knocks had a whole season about some guys at the New York Giants who sit around in their unremarkable offices and look at computers with lists of players on them. First of all: Don&#x27;t care. Second of all: Hey, where did you buy those office decorations—Office Depot? Is this a glamorous professional football operation, or a paper company based in Scranton, Pennsylvania? 
Let me tell you how I would decorate my office if I were to become the Head of Player Personnel for the Jacksonville Jaguar organization, something that many suspect is a distinct possibility. I would have a big office and in the corner is an ordinary-looking water fountain. When someone came in for a meeting I&#x27;d say, &quot;Have a drink from my water fountain. Oh, but it&#x27;s not water in there—it&#x27;s Red Bull.&quot; I would have a water fountain installed in my office that shoots out Red Bull instead of water. That would raise a few eyebrows, I bet.</span>

                              <span>More often than not, an NFL coach&#x27;s job security is tied to how his quarterback performs. This being the case, it&#x27;s rare to see a coach speak publicly about his starting quarterback in anything but encouraging terms. The most incapable bozo in the league can go out there and throw three picks, and his coach will still say stuff like It&#x27;s not one person who wins or loses a game, or We believe [incapable bozo] is still the right guy to lead this football team. This is because most coaches know that publicly undermining an already-bad quarterback will only make things worse for himself.
So it&#x27;s meaningful when a head coach, just two weeks into his tenure, has this to say about a play made by his signal-caller:</span>

                              <span>The final score tells lies, at least by omission. 21-18 implies a normal football game, and not a single point in the Commanders&#x27; win over the Giants was scored without some accompanying angst or absurdity. There is a very normal way to get to 21 points, and it involves touchdowns, and Washington scored zero of those. There are several normal-ish ways to score 18 points, and all the ones you can probably think of include field goals, and the Giants had none of those because they didn&#x27;t have a kicker. Just another Sunday afternoon for two very silly teams.
It was not exactly &quot;bad&quot; football, though both teams are generally very bad. It was farcical, and perversely entertaining, and maybe antifootball, but the players all performed competently. Do you know how NFL rules contain a few obscure, vestigial rules from the game&#x27;s messy origins, rules that feel like they come out of a different sport altogether, because they do? On Sunday it was almost as if the Commanders and Giants were playing two entirely separate parallel universes&#x27; versions of football, one where touchdowns were never invented and one where placekicking is forbidden, and the clash of styles actually made for some pretty good drama. These two teams and their fans will take competitiveness wherever they can find it, I suppose.</span>

                              <span>In Week 1, Caleb Williams and his rebooted Chicago Bears did something that nobody had seen since David Carr and the 2002 Houston Texans. And it was something good! No rookie QB picked No. 1 overall in the past two decades had managed to start and win his team&#x27;s opener, though Williams&#x27;s success came in large part thanks to his defense and special teams. In the 24-17 comeback victory, nine points came from field goals, while the two touchdowns arrived courtesy of a blocked punt and this gift of an underhanded pick-six from a falling Will Levis. The No. 1 overall pick&#x27;s stat line suffered from a distinct lack of pizazz—93 yards on 29 passes, 15 more on the ground—but a win was a win, and after an 0-4 start to the season last year, 1-0 felt pretty good for Chicago.
On Sunday night, however, Williams turned in a much more traditional tribute to David Carr&#x27;s legacy, getting sacked a bunch of times in a loss in Houston. This was a tight game but not a pretty one—19-13 was the final, with only six total points scored in the second half—and as the Texans boosted themselves to 2-0 primarily off kicker Ka&#x27;imi Fairbairn&#x27;s big beefy leg, they illuminated the uphill battle the Bears still face with the developing Williams at the helm.</span>

Except for one team, with a used quarterback, an aging running back, a recycled coach with a specialty in defense, a modest list of weapons, and a sad gray pedigree. That team has scored 11 touchdowns in two games, punted just three times, beaten the face masks off the NFL&#x27;s answer to the Chicago White Sox, and then defeated the most hyped team in the last half-century of American professional sports.</span>

                              <span>Gerrit Cole is, by many people&#x27;s standards, not likable. I find this way of thinking to be incorrect because I like Gerrit Cole, though in a way that&#x27;s not always contingent on his continued success. He&#x27;s a guy with a dad comportment who is very invested in labor and the MLB Players Association. He&#x27;s one of the best pitchers of his generation. He is often one of the most informative pitchers to listen to talk after a start, especially a poor one. He sounds a bit like Kermit the Frog? His 2021 spider tack era proved so fascinating to me that I got in the graph mines for my own satisfaction.
This is not to say that I don&#x27;t derive joy from his successful starts, it&#x27;s just that it is not the only part of what defines a satisfying Cole game. To me, he remains narratively interesting as a hyper-competitive guy who has gone through ups and downs in recent years. It&#x27;s hard to begrudge anyone their disaffection—he can be a bit of a heel on the field, but he&#x27;s a well-constructed one who&#x27;s generally chill off of it, and, most importantly, has a fatal flaw: Rafael Devers.</span>

                              <span>If Lando Norris wanted a defense for his pole-to-win conversion rate in 2024, he can point to Charles Leclerc. Leclerc has gotten every single pole at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix since 2021, including this year&#x27;s, and has converted none of them. Baku was Leclerc&#x27;s race to lose on Sunday, and lose it he did, though not through the traditional Ferrari methodology of engine explosions, egregious strategy calls, or things of that nature. The race was a war of attrition that was, somehow, still won by the first pit stop.
But for all the pre-race chitter chatter about McLaren favoring Norris in team orders, a disastrous qualifying performance meant that Norris&#x27;s chances at a win were infinitesimally low. Instead, it was his teammate, Oscar Piastri, who started P2. Leclerc pulled off the line cleanly, and quickly built a six-second gap to Piastri. But with the medium tires degrading quickly, the undercut became extremely powerful. Sergio Pérez—who, in spite of a horrible 2024, could be a zombie and still get a podium finish at Baku—was the earliest frontrunner to pit. He came out just behind Norris, who started P15 and was accordingly running a different strategy.</span>

After all, it&#x27;s been three days now and the only people in Punditostan who haven&#x27;t urged him to retire are doing either gambling shows, fantasy shows, or both in one. Since those shows do not recognize players as humans, their disinterest is understandable.
But this was the first time for the Sunday morning auctioneers without portfolios to get their crack at diagnosing Tagovailoa&#x27;s latest concussion, and the general consensus remains as it was on Friday morning—that Tua should vote for his own brainpan. This is unusual given that most studio faces tend to err on the side of &quot;I played without half my head one time and had 17 tackles and threw for 367 yards and five scores,&quot; but nobody gets to work the pregame desk by saying, &quot;I think we should wait for the neurologists to see him.&quot; The take must be immediate, forceful, and deniable when incorrect.</span>

Maybe the recent, increasingly loud din made amongst adventurous music fans in the West about Brazilian funk isn&#x27;t your first introduction to it. Maybe you once downloaded those old Diplo funk compilations that came out a couple decades ago (boy, time flies!), from one of his many excursions out Daniel Plainviewing for a new sound to rip off. But maybe you didn&#x27;t really give those comps much attention, easy as they were to lose in your ever-ballooning music library (shoutout to Megaupload!), and your only subsequent interactions with contemporary South American music were from passing references or short clips when a Brazilian soccer player would get ahold of the locker room&#x27;s aux cord (do the kids still use those?) and put his teammates to shame with his dancing skills.</span>

                              <span>Cinema tells us that when a batter steps into the box and the catcher proceeds to tell him which pitch is coming, the catcher may be doing this for one of many reasons. It might have nothing to do with the batter; the catcher could be teaching his hotshot flamethrower not to shake off his elders. It might have everything to do with the batter; perhaps he is Michael Jordan. Some pitches are so good they can be fired past anyone, even a slugger who knows what&#x27;s on the way. 
A new report from ESPN&#x27;s Jeff Passan and Kiley McDaniel says none of these can explain a recent game between the Lakeland Flying Tigers and the Fort Myers Mighty Mussels, Low-A affiliates of the Tigers and Twins. In the second game of a Sept. 6 doubleheader, one the Mighty Mussels needed to win to stay in the Florida State League playoff race, Flying Tigers batters were puzzled to hear 21-year-old Mussels catcher Derek Bender telling them which pitches starter Ross Dunn was about to throw.</span>

                              <span>The continuing assault by university administrators upon elementary school teaching standards advanced another step this week with the latest burst of math, furniture, and geography rearrangement in college sports. The Pacific 12 Conference, which began as the Pac 8 then went to a membership of 10, and then 12, and then worryingly down to two, is now back up to six, only five of which cannot see the ocean after which the conference is named. As a result of that conference’s raid on its own ranks, the Mountain West is now slightly less mountainous and notably less western. If all pundit-based guesstimates are right it will be even less of both by Hallowe&#x27;en. 
Because this is American athletic culture in the third decade of the 2000s, it both fits and is essential that one of those candidates for re-re-re-location is based in, wait for it, Las Vegas.</span>

Visiting their website, I felt like I’d stumbled across a standard conservation group, or maybe a slightly pretentious yoga studio. There were pleasant, neutral-colored serif fonts, a looping video of moss and trees and sunlight breaking through a forest canopy and people happily trudging through the undergrowth in slow motion. The vibe isn’t death so much as what death might yield: greenery, abundance…</span>

                              <span>It wasn&#x27;t even a particularly crazy hit that did it. Tua Tagovailoa was scrambling, so committed to converting a fourth down that he never thought of sliding. Instead he lunged forward, his helmet making contact with Damar Hamlin&#x27;s forearm, and then banging the back of his head on the turf. A normal football play. But normal football plays involve very strong men moving very fast, and Tagovailoa&#x27;s brain, having suffered officially three previous concussions and in reality more than that, is especially susceptible to another one. 
There was a time not all that long ago, when I started blogging, when I&#x27;d need to explain the fencing response: what it is, what it means. Not anymore. Football fans have seen it too many times—we&#x27;ve seen him do it too many times—while somber broadcasters cut to a commercial as the network&#x27;s minor-key injury music plays. Tagovailoa instantly performed the fencing response after being tackled, and no one needed further explanation. Not again.</span>
