Also, an announcement: Defector Trivia is happening on Twitch today at 5 p.m. ET. I would have put that in the newsletter, too.</span>

As frustrating as this can be, I think the very fact that this week&#x27;s episode is a pretty straightforward football-and-Funbag installment of the pod, and not a morose reckoning with the horror and unknowability of this country and this moment, is a good thing. You&#x27;ll get one of those soon enough, but for the time being perhaps I could interest you in something more along the lines of &quot;Three guys trying to figure out what&#x27;s wrong with various lousy NFL teams, as if they had no other care in the world.&quot; Also I got kind of upset about my co-hosts&#x27; bagel orders of choice, which is maybe small or ungenerous of me, but which I also stand by.</span>

Here are some Dad Facts for you. Sam Darnold is 27 years old, three years older than Falcons rookie Michael Penix. He became the youngest starting quarterback in post-merger NFL history after the Jets drafted him. He played for three different franchises in his first six seasons. His first head coach was Todd Bowles, who was fired at the end of his rookie season. His second head coach was Adam Gase, who is Adam Gase. His third head coach was Matt Rhule, who was fired early into Darnold’s second season in Carolina. And his fourth head coach (if you don’t count Steve Wilks, who took over the Panthers as interim coach after Rhule oozed back down to the college ranks) was Kyle Shanahan, who used him exclusively as a backup. His career was Ryan Fitzpatrick’s in miniature, with the proportionately diminished reputation to accompany it.</span>

                              <span>As loyal readers of Defector know, I am never wrong. I&#x27;ve certainly never written an article that was eventually proven to be overly optimistic, overly pessimistic, or overly incorrect. Given my general infallibility, I come today to apologize for my first incorrect thought in at least three years: The new Champions League format kind of whips ass.
I didn&#x27;t think it would, and I wasn&#x27;t alone in that thought. When it was announced, my first reaction was that this would just make the group stage—now called the league stage—even more tilted in favor of the big clubs on the continent. Whereas before, these clubs could be thrown in together in a group of death—like last season&#x27;s Dortmund-PSG-Milan-Newcastle meat grinder—now, my theory went, they would just be able to mop up on a diet of weak clubs to secure a spot in the knockout rounds.</span>

                              <span>Derrick White, unglamorous secondary ball-handler for the defending champion Boston Celtics, does many things well. He&#x27;s a knock-down shooter who in his eighth professional season is attempting a career-high 9.6 threes per game, or about 68 percent of his total shot output. He&#x27;s a Tony Allen-level perimeter defender, a Danny Green-level transition defender, and among the greatest shot-blocking guards in NBA history. You might lazily describe him as a 3-and-D specialist, except that he is also a competent and quick-thinking passer, a slick and reliable pick-and-roll operator, and an artist from floater range. Through nine games this season he is giving the Celtics 20 points a night on 64 percent true shooting, and is averaging better than three assists per turnover, and is using just a shad…</span>

                              <span>The Golden State Warriors are evidently the dynasty that won&#x27;t die. It is a dynasty that will age and eventually expire, of course, because they all do, and maybe this will all collapse in a heap of spent tendons and uncontrolled rage. But dynasties can sometimes linger beyond their rational shelf life; San Antonio&#x27;s fifth championship came seven years after its fourth. And every time the Warriors seem to flatline—the 2024 season, for one example—they rise up and remember themselves. What they remember, specifically, is not really that complicated. When the Warriors defend, they are truly dynastic. It’s not as easy as they make it look, but it is almost as simple as that.
Their 118-112 win over Boston last night was a fresh reinforcement of that essential truth. Yes, many folks will be distracted by Steve Kerr having the carte blanche to yell at Stephen Curry after Curry passed the mythical 3,000 career turnover mark, but all that has been true forever; Curry turnovers, Kerr getting cranky about it, Curry not making a thing out of getting yelled at, and so endlessly on. Same as it ever was, same as it ever was.</span>

                              <span>In Quincy, the 2018 documentary meant to capture the totality of Quincy Jones&#x27;s contributions to the last 70-plus years of music, film, and television, he spoke about his time living in Paris in the late 1950s and working under acclaimed composer Nadia Boulanger. &quot;There are only 12 notes, and you should investigate what everyone did with those 12 notes,&quot; she said to him, as he explains in the doc. It was the lesson of not just the outward simplicity of music, but the lineage and vast worlds contained within its grand history. It was a call to be a student of the art, just as much as a player.
Jones, who died on Sunday at the age of 91, leaves behind an enormous absence in entertainment. He was the ultimate connective tissue in making the greatest media of the last few eras of entertainment. He orchestrated Count Basie&#x27;s band when they played for Frank Sinatra. He composed the theme for Sanford and Son, and scored films like In The Heat of the Night, The Italian Job, and The Color Purple. He produced The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, co-founded Vibe magazine, brought jazz and hip-hop together for his Back On The Block album. Off The Wall, Thriller, Bad—there is not one medium, genre, or business within entertainment that did not have Jones&#x27;s hand in it. He was just as eager to teach the intricacies of making good music and art as he was to tell those ribald stories about Sinatra, Michael Jackson, or Prince. His death is not a surprise, but it is upsetting all the same, less because of what he&#x27;s done and more because of how little the modern entertainment industry resembles the kind of place that fosters that kind of artistic talent and allowed him to thrive.</span>

                              <span>WHITEHORSE, Canada — I stood on an empty stretch of the Alaska Highway and squinted north as the sky darkened. I had parked a couple of miles away, at a relatively busy intersection on the edge of the Yukon’s small capital city, and pedaled north up a long hill onto this quieter stretch of road. It was just after 9:30 on a Saturday night. I waited on the southbound shoulder, helmeted and hi-vis-vested, watching for a cyclist.
When a black dot crested the next hill, my heart started beating a little faster. I turned, threw a leg over my own bicycle, and stood on my toes, checking over my shoulder as the dot coalesced into a woman pedaling steadily toward me. As she came closer, I pushed off and started riding, trying to get up to speed so she wouldn’t just blow right by.</span>

On the last day of vamping about opinions before the election became a fact, in a roundtable discussion among New York Times pundits, the respectable conservative David Brooks tried to turn to history to understand what might be coming. &quot;Mostly I just worry about Trump&#x27;s general incompetence,&quot; Brooks wrote. &quot;We got lucky during his term, because there were no existential or complicated threats, until the pandemic.&quot;</span>

                              <span>A frugal baker can also be an adventurous baker, in the sense that leftover ingredients from one recipe can be used as an excuse to try something new. I still had a bunch of marshmallows from the fudgy frosting I made for these decadent peanut butter brownies that use approximately one tanker truck full of sugar (they tasted spectacular; I will go to the hospital if I eat one more before at least 18 months have passed). I can use marshmallows in hot chocolate, but it is 75 degrees right now, so instead I thought of the one other use I know for marshmallows. I did a search for &quot;smores brownies&quot; and hit this extremely basic and simple recipe, which I thought would occupy my mind without providing any extra stress on Tuesday night.
Basically, all you&#x27;re doing in this recipe is baking brownies from a mix and putting a bunch of s&#x27;mores toppings on it midway through. I&#x27;d actually never in my life used a pre-packaged mix before, but I appreciated the shortcut on this occasion. I baked it for 15 minutes, took it out of the oven, and added a very appealing collage of chocolate, marshmallow, and graham cracker.</span>

But how are matters of the heart mediated through the sometimes delicate, sometimes volatile state of brohood? Could you leap without looking into a new romance if subtly pushed, or, perhaps, hit by a flying tackle from your most supportive bro? Can two college-aged bros survive a bond of mutual support without serious injury?</span>

The streets near my neighborhood, normally clogged with cars dropping off children at an elementary school down the road, were mostly empty. Public schools were closed, and the same yard signs I’d been walking and driving past for the last several months—Trump/Vance, Harris/Walz—seemed, ironically, beside the point. In a country where the lead-up to a presidential election is excruciatingly drawn out, where, in this specific case, an incumbent head of state more closely resembling a corpse threatened to run for office again before bowing out at the last second, throwing the entire race into disarray, the eventual arrival of the day itself was lackluster. I drove to work, where I overheard murmurs from customers about how they voted, the increased police pr…</span>

                              <span>It doesn&#x27;t appear to have been close. Georgia flipped for Trump. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, too. The Blue Wall crumbled like Jericho&#x27;s. Just about everywhere voted redder than in 2020. Young people went right. New York City went right. The polls said what they said, but then Americans went to the voting booth and said what they said, which is that they want four more years of Donald Trump. This feels worse than 2016. That was a squeaker, and you could convince yourself it was a fluke. The Comey letter. No Midwest Dem ground game. A uniquely unpopular candidate. Belief that maybe Trump wasn&#x27;t being totally serious about the things he said, or might surround himself with smarter, better people. Maybe it was possible people were voting for Trump just to seize on an intrusive thought, a call of the void. You can&#x27;t tell yourself these stories this time. Trump is a known quantity. We know what he would do as President, and we know all the things he&#x27;d promised to do as President a second time, and millions of Americans took all that into consideration and said, Yes, I want that.
What do you do in a place like this, with an electorate like that? You survive it, mostly, unless you don&#x27;t. You will try to figure out how it got there, got so angry and stupid and cruel, so that you can nudge it somewhere else next time. You do this by seeing what went wrong this time. This seems like an impossible task this morning, because everything went wrong.</span>

                              <span>No one knows anything. Everyone claiming to know something is lying. The odds are 50-50, always, even if they say the odds are different. And though it can be a delicious hell to watch cable news and scroll on your phone all night, it does not make actually the election get decided any faster. In all likelihood, there will be nothing to know until well past midnight, if not several days from now. It is perhaps unreasonable to expect anyone who cares about this country to truly log off in any real way, but perhaps you can make your evening less miserable as the polls close. What if you could go to the bookstore and pick up something that would be gripping enough to stop you from watching Steve Kornacki zoom in on some random county that is behaving slightly differently than it did four or eight years ago? What if you could escape this mortal level of hell by entering your imagination guided by a sure hand? 
Well, you could try! The key to choosing a good book for election night is that it must be engaging, plot-heavy, and more desirable than your phone. You must be so mesmerized by what is happening that you are more invested in the next page than you are in the results out of Fulton County, which, remember, you cannot affect with your television-watching. This is both a high bar and a low bar for fiction to clear. Also: The book should not explicitly contain material that reminds you of the election, and it should not be so highbrow that if you check your phone every 10 minutes (you are allowed to cheat, and will) you will lose the plot.</span>

                              <span>Imagine you are running the New York City Marathon, trying like hell to hold onto the group setting a sub–three hour pace.
You are ingesting disgusting energy slurry from gel packs, listening to Crazy Frog on your wireless headphones for motivation, and longing for your foam roller. You can feel sweat emerging from the soles of your feet. As you run north up First Avenue, you feel the ache set in, and you grit your teeth. You are off the pace, slowing, but you know you only have to endure 30 more minutes of pain. All of a sudden an electric Citi Bike, ridden by a guileless jackass in a yellow hi-vis vest, catches up to you, then a second electric Citi Bike, also piloted by a jolly dipshit in a yellow hi-vis vest, catches up to you. Through the throng of miserable souls, they are filming a hot shirtless man in tactical sunglasses, who is trying not to look at the phones filming him as he runs at 6:44 pace. You look around at your fellow runners to see if they are also seeing this trio when you drift ever so slightly into one of the electric Citi Bike cameramen, who sends you careening into the barriers and onto the deck. As you seize into a full-body cramp, you wonder what final product could be worth such debasement, and then you smile as you realize that because of the social media video content that ended your marathon, people will discover running and lead better, healthier lives. Your sacrifice was worth it.</span>

                              <span>It all comes back to the missed opportunity of 2016.
That year, of course, marked the biggest disappointment in the history of the San Jose Sharks—a loss in the Stanley Cup Final to the Pittsburgh Penguins. What could have been the culmination of nearly two decades as one of the NHL&#x27;s most consistent franchises instead left Sharks fans hanging yet again. While that generation of stars still managed to string together one last push in 2019, which ended in Game 6 of the Western Conference Final, it&#x27;s that failure eight years ago that continues to define San Jose&#x27;s identity.</span>

                              <span>Joe Few, son of Gonzaga men&#x27;s basketball coach Mark Few, has fond memories of hanging out courtside as a kid and asking his dad to put the walk-ons into the game. &quot;Don&#x27;t ever do that again,&quot; he recalled his dad replying in one instance involving a crowd chant for Rem Bakamus. Now Joe himself is one such walk-on. The redshirt junior has appeared in 29 games and averaged under three minutes per. With the Bulldogs up 36 points on Baylor in Monday&#x27;s season opener, Mark Few reasonably concluded that it was Son Time.
&quot;It might blow the roof off this place if Joe Few scores,&quot; said the ESPN commentator as Gonzaga set up its offense. Instead, Dusty Stromer&#x27;s lazy pass was picked off, Joe hustled back on defense to get in front of Baylor guard V.J. Edgecombe, and the two of them collaborated in the clearest possible visual representation of &quot;five-star recruit vs. coach&#x27;s son.&quot;</span>

Put simply, and to borrow a phrase from our Bakery Division, the Eastern Conference is made up almost entirely of warm, flaky ass. And it&#x27;s going to stay that way all year. Now that&#x27;s turgidity you can taste.
Now, we realize there have only been 108 games played so far over 11 days, which measures out to less than nine percent of the season. We know, too, that early projections do not necessarily indicate final results, as the gathering cadres of electoral fraud lawyers will make rancidly clear over the next several days. But the East has two teams, Cleveland and Boston, who are 15-1 and well worth your attention. The third best team at this moment by record is Brooklyn, which had to grind its gears audibly to hold off Memphis last night to get to 4-4. Memphis is also 4-4, a record that has more reasonably placed them in 10th place in the West.</span>

                              <span>Just days before the presidential election, the death of a gray squirrel named Peanut has become a somewhat inexplicable rallying cry for some of the worst people in the country. JD Vance claimed at a rally that Donald Trump was &quot;fired up&quot; about Peanut&#x27;s death. Elon Musk tweeted an unsettling AI rendering of a red squirrel (a different species) cloaked in Jedi garb with a quote attributed to &quot;Obi PNut Kenobi.&quot; On Nov. 2, the House Judiciary GOP tweeted &quot;Justice for Peanut.&quot; $PNUT is trending, and I refuse to learn what that means.
If you are a normal person, you might have not heard of Peanut and have no interest in learning who he is, in which case I wish you a peaceful and evolved day. But you are open to a light bit of brain poisoning in the name of knowledge, step inside, and let me explain how the saga of Peanut the Squirrel took over the internet and may or may not influence the 2024 presidential election.</span>

                              <span>Since their inception, food competition shows have seen very little real innovation. Most entries into the genre are variations on a theme, the stakes artificially raised through less time allotted, increasingly sadistic ingredient choices or semi-regular trauma dumps. There&#x27;s something deliberately anesthetizing in this; in the same way that I know a Starbucks sous vide egg bite will taste the same whether I buy it in New Jersey or Texas, I know what I&#x27;m in for when I turn on Chopped or Great British Bake-Off or Top Chef.
At first glance Culinary Class Wars, Netflix’s newest entrant into this gastronomical pantheon, looks to be yet another of these variations. There are familiar elements at play here; two celebrity judges, mystery ingredients and seemingly rigged team challenges make frequent appearances.

                              <span>Why does Brian Daboll hate the Irish? 
Among the many failed decisions the soon-to-be-former Giants head coach made on what was a bloody awful Sunday for his home side, none were more noticed than Daboll’s bypassing extra-point kicks in favor of two-point conversions in the fourth quarter—not once, but twice. Daboll kept kicker Jude McAtamney on the sidelines, only to watch poor and poorly supported quarterback Daniel Jones muck things up both times, and see his team lose precious points in a 27-22 loss to the Commanders.</span>

                              <span>For many reasons, the São Paulo Grand Prix is my favorite weekend of any in Formula 1. The track is the best, or at least my favorite, on the ever-more-bloated calendar, and its traditional position towards the end of the season makes it appointment viewing any time there is a semblance of a title race. Throw in the possibility for rain, given that the race almost always takes place in São Paulo&#x27;s wet season, and the stage is often set for chaos, drama, and all-timer performances. The 2024 edition at the Autódromo de Interlagos might end up the most memorable weekend of all, if not for the pure quality on display, then for the sheer chaos that altered the schedule, upended the grid both before and during the race, and left the only man who could have won this race at the top of the podium, and within millimeters of another world title.
Let&#x27;s start with that man, Max Verstappen. While last weekend in Mexico brought out some of Verstappen&#x27;s worst impulses en route to a penalty-aided sixth-place finish that kicked Lando Norris&#x27; title charge and its corresponding narrative into overdrive, Sunday&#x27;s race was Verstappen at his absolute best. That&#x27;s not to say he had a great Sunday altogether; thanks to heavy rain on Saturday, qualifying was postponed to Sunday morning, under still wet conditions. Thanks to poorly timed red flag in the second part of qualifying, Verstappen was mired in 12th place for the start of the race, and a five-grid penalty, due to adding in a new internal combustion engine, pushed him further back to 17th. To make matters worse, Norris nabbed pole position, giving the McLaren driver hope of a not just a big points finish but also the possibility that Verstappen wouldn&#x27;t get many points of his own, shrinking the drivers&#x27; championship gap further.</span>

                              <span>The NFL is becoming weirder with every week. If you doubt that, let us present Saquon Barkley&#x27;s airborne rear end as the first thing you see when he and it sail over your head. It&#x27;s becoming too hard to keep up with all of the concussion-infused nonsense in this league, especially in a week in which two teams with one win on the season triumphed on the same day.
But then, just as your disorientation is threatening to swallow you whole, there are the Las Vegas Raiders. To call them a pillar of stability would be inaccurate, but damn if they aren’t reliable. Their gift for ass-backwardness (hello again, Saquon) is overwhelming, and after a loss on Sunday they defenestrated three of their most prominent offensive coaches—nine months after those coaches were hired, and nine games into the current season.</span>

                              <span>The hurdle only gained the Eagles five more yards, on a drive that ended with a field goal. But it was one of the weirder things you could ever see on a football field; until it happened, it wouldn&#x27;t have even seemed to be on the menu. It will be in Eagles highlight packages forever. Early in the second quarter on Sunday, Saquon Barkley took a pass from Jalen Hurts in the flat. He juked one defender to pick up a first down, then spun away from another. Now with his back to the end zone, Barkley jumped into the air and over Jacksonville Jaguars cornerback Jarrian Jones and landed on his feet. It was a play that had Eagles color commentator Mike Quick screaming. “It was the best play I’ve ever seen,” head coach Nick Sirianni said.
Eagles beat reporter Zach Berman wrote that down the line, this is the play you will first remember from this game. That makes sense, and not just because the play was unique and incredible. When the Eagles honored LeSean McCoy at halftime yesterday, they showed some of his runs in the Blizzard Bowl. Nobody remembered that the Eagles trailed 14-0 in that game, or that they gave up punt and kickoff return touchdowns. They only cared that the Eagles came back to win 34-20, with McCoy rushing for a franchise-record 217 yards. (People tailgating yesterday will probably also remember that Robert De Niro and John Kerry were there.) The Eagles beat the Jaguars on Sunday, although what was once a laugher came down to the wire. Barkley&#x27;s hurdle will be remembered a lot longer than that, and deservingly so.</span>

                              <span>Heidi Clements jolted me out of a glaze-eyed scrolling spiral one night a few months ago. A typical video of hers starts with her bending over toward her camera and then stepping back to reveal her starting point, a bra and pants. Then she builds an outfit while a voiceover shares a funny or heartbreaking or inspiring nugget of wisdom, like &quot;If you don&#x27;t ask for what you want, you probably won&#x27;t get it,&quot; and &quot;You may say you have nothing to wear, I say: just get dressed. Even if you have nowhere to go, just get dressed. Even if you don&#x27;t like how your body feels right now, just get dressed.&quot;
Clements has amazing style. It&#x27;s androgynous and playful, a little punk, a little Stevie, California-easy with a heavy silver chain or a black leather bag. Her arms are covered in tattoos and she has a shaggy haircut I&#x27;ve been trying to learn to cut via internet videos. Her nose is pierced with a silver hoop and she loves a red lip. She&#x27;s an influencer; she has more than 600,000 followers on both TikTok and Instagram and her manager&#x27;s information is in her bio.</span>

                              <span>In the second quarter of their game against the Cowboys, the Atlanta Falcons faced fourth-and-3 from the Dallas 36-yard line. What played out once Kirk Cousins got the ball snapped to him was a pristine example of two interrelated statistical probabilities coming true at the same time. The Cowboys&#x27; pass defense allows the most yards per attempt in the NFL, and had given up the second-highest number of plays of 40 yards or more even before Trevon Diggs tore a muscle in his calf. Falcons wide receiver Darnell Mooney, meanwhile, leads the NFL in receptions of 20 or more yards. As three Cowboys defenders bumbled into each other, with Diggs raising his hands in disbelief, Mooney ran into a pasture of space and sauntered in for an easy touchdown.
That play was one of the many embarrassments suffered by the Cowboys as they lost, 27-21, and fell to 3-5. Their year is less than halfway over and they already have as many losses as they had in each of the past three seasons. The football Mike McCarthy&#x27;s team is playing has him smashing tablets on the sideline, Ezekiel Elliott is only nominally on the team, and they have to play through a brutal schedule without several key players, including possibly Dak Prescott. The NFL&#x27;s highest-paid player hurt his hamstring on a run in the third quarter and was quickly taken out of the game, leaving Cooper Rush to see out the loss. After three losses in a row, things are suddenly looking dire.</span>

                              <span>The first five or so games of an NBA season can only give you so much quantitative data about how the next 77 or so will go—e.g. the Warriors might not be this great without Steph Curry because they have mostly played bad or injured teams; the Nets are not going to remain this competent, as Dennis Schröder will at some point miss a shot—but they are useful as qualitative exercises. Shots will go in or not go in at aberrant rates in the short term, which doesn&#x27;t tell you much, but the processes by which teams generate good shots and prevent their opponents from doing so tell you plenty. Some qualities, then, that the Milwaukee Bucks have shown through five games: unconnected, slow, stinky, creatively adrift, thin, and generally miserable.
The Bucks are 1-5, winners in Philadelphia on the second night of the season and then losers of five straight, with double-digit losses to the Bulls and Nets in there. They lost a heartbreaker to the Cavs on Saturday as Donovan Mitchell nailed a tough game-winner.
