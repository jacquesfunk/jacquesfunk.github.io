                              <span>Today we’re listening to Staying: Leaving Records Aid to Artists Impacted by the Los Angeles Wildfires. The collection consists of 98 tracks by artists such as André 3000, Emily Sprague, Laraaji, Arushi Jain, Celia Hollander, Photay, Total Blue, Sam Wilkes, Luke Schneider, marine eyes, Reggie Watts, and KMRU. To quote the liner notes, “Leaving has pulled out all the proverbial stops to release a benefit compilation consisting of affiliated artists and supporters far and wide (many of whom have indeed lost everything). Seeking to supplement the numerous GoFundMes and the profound, often harrowing acts of mutual aid that are currently buoying recovery efforts, and in lieu of donating to a third party organization, all proceeds will be donated directly to impacted individuals.” Just a Bandcamp link today.</span>

You know, the one with all the points and yards and lead changes and quarterback stuff. Yeah, that one. The one that sucked even though everyone liked it at the time.
Yes, you spoiled piglets, you&#x27;re getting the much-dreaded reprise of Chiefs-Eagles, the third-highest scoring Superb Owl of them all. It&#x27;s all because Josh Allen couldn&#x27;t reach Dalton Kincaid with a drive-saving pass because George Karlaftis was the one pass rusher the Buffalo Bills couldn&#x27;t account for with the AFC championship on the line, and because Patrick Mahomes could find Samaje Perine in the flat with the game&#x27;s security on the line. Because Kansas City is on a roll of winning games by a cheese-slice-thick margin almost unprecedented in NFL history and is, for the moment, the most unbeatable beatable team there has ever been. Because the Chiefs, for all their socially recidivist trappings, just knows how to do this shit.</span>

Now Malinin is back, and this weekend he competed a free skate that has him attempting seven quads, plus a now-legal backflip. Look, there&#x27;s no need to get too technical here. It&#x27;s. Seven. Freaking. Quads. (No one has ever landed seven clean in competition.) Sometimes, the facts explain themselves.
Malinin didn&#x27;t land all seven quads on Sunday at the U.S. figure skating championships, but his entire free skate is still impressive as hell.</span>

After years without a deep run in March Madness, the Stephen C. O’Connell Center&#x27;s Rowdy Reptiles seem to finally have good reason to get loud. 
Except on Nov. 8 The Independent Florida Alligator broke the story that the team&#x27;s head coach, Todd Golden, has been the subject of a university Title IX investigation since September. Per The Alligator, the complaint said that Golden was under investigation for allegations of sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, and stalking aimed at Florida students. From The Alligator:</span>

                              <span>The Washington Commanders are new to this big game thing, which is why they acted on their first drive like their only way to beat the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC championship game was to never relinquish the ball. They must have known that they would spend the rest of Sunday relinquishing everything.
Such is the price of being a newbie—errors happen and then compound themselves. The plucky underdog with the pretty new quarterback (Jayden Daniels) started out treating fourth down like it was second down with a bad attitude. They drove for 18 plays, converted two fourth-and-punt-the-ball downs, and ground out seven minutes of clock to give the game the chaotic feel that they needed it to have.  It worked out for the opening score, though weirdly they kicked a field goal rather than press their luck. It was the omen that nobody saw coming.</span>

                              <span>The FIA&#x27;s priority for much of the 2024 Formula 1 season was cracking down on drivers&#x27; foul language over the radio and in press conferences. The word fuck, it made clear, was no longer acceptable, though for Federation Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile President Mohammed Ben Sulayem&#x27;s clear, dog whistle–laden stance on the matter—&quot;We have to differentiate between our sport, motorsport, and rap music&quot;—it was not formally codified until yesterday, Jan. 23. The new International Sporting Code recommends specific punishments for misconduct, defined as language or actions that reasonably be construed as either &quot;offensive, insulting, coarse, rude, or abrasive,&quot; or threatening. Within any two-year period, a first offense would incur a €40,000 fine (around $41,000), a second offense would incur a €80,000 fine and a suspended one-month ban, and a third offense would incur a €120,000 fine, a one-month ban and deduction of championship points. It remains unclear what a fourth offense would entail.
A professional sports league having a codified swear jar is ludicrous at face value. Though governing bodies frequently do ludicrous things and operate on ludicrous assumptions, it remains a mystery how three swear words over the course of two years would be more damaging to the sport than suspending a driver—like, say, the notoriously potty-mouthed but four-time World Champion Max Verstappen—for a month.  Verstappen&#x27;s formal punishment for swearing in Singapore last year was mandatory community service. Charles Leclerc&#x27;s punishment for swearing in Mexico was a €10,000 fine, half of which was suspended for a year.</span>

                              <span>I suppose I expected something more eclectic and thrilling out of this collision between two of the most innovative sentence-level orators in New York City. And when Eric Adams said, &quot;I&#x27;m a bald-headed, earring-wearing mayor that&#x27;s saying that you don&#x27;t have to have this one stereotypical look to be successful&quot; early in his hour-long interview with Stephen A. Smith, my appetite for stupid utterances was whetted. But I was soon disappointed, and in time, disgusted. When Adams began a story &quot;I will stop in the middle of the night when barber shops close down—I will go inside, sit down, smoke a cigar, drink a little Hennessy,&quot; I thought were were going to end in a destination more interesting than complaints about &quot;the people who are putting out the messages of what is important to the Democratic party.&quot; That&#x27;s really all this conversation was: a heavily indicted man arguing that he was ideologically abandoned, and then targeted, by a political party that he keeps threatening to quit.
Sure, it&#x27;s a little funny to hear Adams complain that his biggest challenge as mayor is the fact that the media doesn&#x27;t acknowledge his successes. It&#x27;s a little funny to see him play the hits, like the &quot;haters and waiters&quot; spiel. He is sometimes sort of accidentally correct, like when he argues that the Democratic party has largely abandoned working-class concerns. And he did have one refreshingly Adamsian turn of phrase: &quot;When a bullet carve a highway of death in your community and it hits someone it&#x27;s not a Democrat or Republican.&quot; There was room for improvement in the delivery.</span>

And, sure, the most-watched and talked-about bout of the last couple years, Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul, was far more a circus than a legitimate matchup. But the sport really isn’t in a horrible place right now. There are plenty of stars deserving of a bigger audience.
Case in point: Naoya Inoue, the reigning world junior featherweight champion and an absolute superstar in his native Japan. But only in his native Japan. You likely don’t know this, but Inoue already fought today. He retained his title with another artful, violent, and very expected knockout, this one of South Korean challenger Ye Joon Kim in Tokyo.</span>

                              <span>If you are light enough, the water&#x27;s surface is just another place to stretch your legs. The animal kingdom abounds with water-walkers: water striders perch atop ponds with thin legs held aloft with the help of water-repelling hair; basilisk lizards can run as far as five feet across water with long toes creating buoyant pockets of air; birds called western grebes have a mating ritual that involves running for up to seven seconds across water as their wide, flat feet slap the surface. And cricket frogs were long observed to cross ponds by way of &quot;skittering,&quot; meaning jumping across the water without sinking.
Intrigued by the frogs&#x27; water-walking prowess, a group of scientists decided to study how the amphibians managed to stay at the top of the water&#x27;s surface as they skittered, findings they recently reported in a paper in the Journal of Experimental Biology. When they filmed the cricket frogs on high-speed video, the researchers learned the hard truth behind skittering. Instead of bounding across the surface like a real water-walker, the cricket frogs completely submerged themselves in water between each hop. &quot;This study is a testament to how even processes that seem so obvious can have a lot going on underneath the surface,&quot; Jasmine Nirody, a biophysicist at the University of Chicago who was not involved with the new paper, wrote in an email.</span>

                              <span>Liam Coen has been a head coach in the National Football League for, what, several hours now, and already he has set impossibly lofty expectations for himself. As we all know, in sports your reputation isn&#x27;t found in provable success as much as it in convincing people that you were better than you should have been. And for that, Coen can thank the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Jacksonville Jaguars, proving yet again that when you&#x27;re looking for weird, you&#x27;re looking at Florida.
Nobody outside The Other Bay Area much knew Coen before last week, but he is credited in that coachly way for the revivification of Baker Mayfield. And sure, why not? Mayfield was authentically great under Coen’s direction this season after nearly washing out of the league in the years prior; the Bucs didn&#x27;t matter, then they did. Credit spreads like paint when a bad offensive team becomes a good one, and that will tend to benefit the guy who is otherwise only known as a forehead with a hat talking into a Denny&#x27;s placemat. That’s Coen.</span>

                              <span>I know. I know. We write about Nikola Jokic all the time on Defector. We&#x27;re just as aware of this as you are. I am telling you this at the start of this particular blog about Nikola Jokic because I want to make it clear that we do try to exercise some self-restraint here. OK, yes, fine, we did recently publish a whole blog about the fact that Jokic slapped a basketball a great distance, but that really was crazy. We try to keep the bar high, but the problem is that Jokic just keeps doing incredible things. 
Take last night&#x27;s game against the Kings, which Jokic finished with 35 points, 22 rebounds, 17 assists, and two blocks. Wilt Chamberlain is the only other player in NBA history to have put up more than 35 points, 20 rebounds, and 15 assists in a single game, and Jokic&#x27;s particular stat line had never been achieved before. Nuggets fans like to track these performances, which they call Jokigamis. It feels like Jokic has been producing one every week this season.</span>

                              <span>You know how it is. Someone asks how you&#x27;re doing—in a casual setting, or at the top of the podcast you do every week—and in that moment you must decide just how honest an answer is appropriate, or kind, or just reasonably in keeping with the intention behind the question. If it seemed like I was stuck for an answer this week, it&#x27;s because I truly was. There&#x27;s a lot of bad stuff happening, enough that the usual &quot;I&#x27;m good&quot; kind of stuck in my throat. This is not the only reason why we have guests, but it is a good one. I was determined not to get up there and filibuster and fret in front of Justin Halpern, returning champion Distraction guest, on-call Padres magus, and executive producer of Abbott Elementary and Harley Quinn.

                              <span>In his October 2024 introductory press conference as the new president of baseball operations of the San Francisco Giants, Buster Posey declared, &quot;We&#x27;re in the memory-making business.&quot; No matter any outsized belief in RBI, it was the strongest repudiation of the old Farhan Zaidi regime, an optimized, min-maxed platoon machine with a veritable lack of new dudes, which spent each year scuttling about trying to sneak into the Wild Card, caught lightning in a bottle in 2021, and—after showing prediction models who&#x27;s boss—never broke .500 since. It doesn&#x27;t matter if Matt Chapman never puts up another 7 rWAR season, or if Willy Adames is the ideal guy to drop a $182 million contract on—so long as the Giants&#x27; roster winds up with people to root for, year over year, Posey&#x27;s team-building philosophy will readily outperform Zaidi&#x27;s as a maker of memories.
Combine commitment to the memory-making business with an optimized, min-maxed machine, and you wind up with the Los Angeles Dodgers, who are, if you missed it, ruining baseball. Admittedly, signing a guy so fans and future fans alike will have someone to root for is a bit different from signing every guy on the market; the latter is, to simplify a bit, the Dodgers&#x27; approach to this past offseason. So far, Los Angeles has signed or extended, in a semi-rapid succession of long-term contracts: Blake Snell, Tommy Edman, Hye-seong Kim (a 25-year-old free agent with 37 career home runs in the KBO, who is not to be confused with cool Padres guy Ha-seong Kim), and then, in the span of one week, Roki Sasaki, Tanner Scott, and Kirby Yates.</span>

                              <span>Draymond Green has been to therapy. He&#x27;s worked through some things, addressed some pent-up feelings of anger and insecurity. Now he has made it through to the other side, and you know what? He still kinda feels like he was justified in punching Jordan Poole back in 2022.
This is the only logical takeaway from Green&#x27;s latest podcast episode, where he once again got into the infamous altercation. After the Golden State Warriors beat the Washington Wizards in an otherwise unmemorable game—save for the fact that Poole got a warm reception from the San Francisco crowd—Poole commented on his relationship with the Warriors locker room by saying &quot;I love those guys over there,&quot; before immediately correcting himself: &quot;I love most of those guys over there.&quot; Green, who truly cannot help himself, took the bait, tweeting in reply &quot;I really am sorry.&quot; Green reiterated this sentiment on the podcast saying, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry. I shouldn&#x27;t have punched him. But it happened. Let&#x27;s move on.&quot;</span>

                              <span>When the Champions League schedule came out, the Matchday Seven showdown between Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City looked to be a veritable clash of the titans, but I have to admit I was a bit underwhelmed by its timing. Thanks to the new league-stage format, I figured that two of Europe&#x27;s most expensively assembled sides would be safely through to the knockouts by this point, and that the match wouldn&#x27;t have all that much riding on it.
I was wrong on two counts. First, I have to admit I did not foresee that El Gásico would be not a matchup at the top of the table, but rather a true battle of survival. Entering Wednesday&#x27;s match in Paris, both clubs were in a klaxon-worthy panic, marooned in the bottom third of the 36-team table and in real jeopardy of missing the knockout round all together. My second mistake was in assuming that a PSG-City match would be anything but a banger, an intuition that seemed to bear out during the scoreless first half, only to explode into a delirious 4-2 PSG comeback win that might have been the most entertaining match of the campaign.</span>

It’s the mid-2000s. I’ve just moved to the D.C. area. My wife is from here. I am not. My wife has friends here. I do not. My wife has a job. I do not. Every day, I have to boot up a PC we borrowed from my brother-in-law and scroll through listings on Monster that are either fake jobs, or jobs I’ve already seen listed 500 times before. In the meantime, my wife is the breadwinner, working a cubicle job she hates in a suburban office building she may hate even more. We only have one car—a champagne Honda Accord her parents let us have—so I’m her ride to and from work. I have to pick her up every day just after five, but sometimes her work runs a little bit long and I stay in the car to wait. I don’t mind this wait, because while I don’t know anyone in this town, I do know that everyone here (at least, for now) loves football, and their football team in particular.</span>

                              <span>The Oscar nominees for 2025 were announced Thursday morning. The list for Best Original Score caused a minor stir in Defector&#x27;s Slack when it was observed that the score of Challengers, by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, didn&#x27;t make the cut. Reznor and Ross have been nominated before, lots of times, for lots of different awards. They&#x27;ve won a couple Oscars already, a BAFTA, an Emmy, three Golden Globes, and probably some Grammys. The score for Challengers was well-received and memorable, and was an important part of a well-reviewed film. And like most Reznor and Ross joints, it&#x27;s something a normal person might choose to bump on their car&#x27;s sound system, in those moments where they feel like driving very fast. Certainly I will not be jamming out to the score of The Wild Robot, a movie I had never heard of before this morning.
Unfortunately, I am forced to rush to the defense of the Academy in this case. However jaunty and fun the rest of the Challengers score may be, the Academy was right to penalize Reznor and Ross for having created the song &quot;Yeah x10,&quot; which is the most irritating piece of music imaginable.</span>

                              <span>Vishal Subramanyan and Prakrit Jain had never even heard of the rare shrew they would soon spend months chasing. The students were both in the same mammalogy class at the University of California, Berkeley, which included trips teaching students how to catch, handle, and process small mammals. On one such trip, Jain brought his camera and snapped some shots of voles and deer mice. Curious if there were any other small and obscure mammals nearby to photograph, Jain perused a list of the mammals of California and noticed that one species, the Mount Lyell shrew, had never been photographed before. &quot;I was immediately fascinated,&quot; Jain said.
Jain told Subramanyan about the shrew in September, and the two hatched a scheme. Subramanyan, who has since graduated from Berkeley, is a wildlife conservation photographer and a creator in the California Academy of Science&#x27;s California Creators for Nature program. Neither Jain nor Subramanyan had worked with a species like a shrew before; Subramanyan ordinarily photographs wildlife giants such as mountain lions and wolves, and Jain ordinarily photographs itty-bitty invertebrates, such as scorpions and arachnids. The small shrew offered them a chance to meet in the middle.</span>

                              <span>The further we get away from the 2016 Democratic National Convention the more I become convinced that Michelle Obama standing on that stage saying, “When they go low, we go high,” was a death knell. By now, she’s realized it. In the brief period of this past election cycle where the Democrats were trying to win, calling Donald Trump and J.D. Vance “weird”, she backed away from the statement on the convention stage. But then, just as suddenly, Democrats backed off their line of attack. Why try something new, to seeming success, when you could run the same old playbook to failure?
The reason that phrase sticks in my head is because it was a failed strategy from the get-go. If your opponent is “going low,” following the rules will not help you. You will not be given a gold star by the teacher. In fact, it will only give your opponent more space and opportunity to play dirty. The Republicans (who are winning politics, currently) know that they are in a competition, and that the Democrats are their opponents and enemies. They behave like it. Democrats, over and over again, seem to be trying to prove that they are not actually in a feud with Republicans. In their efforts at peace-keeping, they allow violence to reign.

                              <span>Even prodigies must learn hard lessons in public sometimes. Carlos Alcaraz has won four major titles and extracts tennis wisdom at a disturbing rate, but there are plenty of situations on court that the 21-year-old has yet to confront. In Tuesday’s Australian Open quarterfinal against the 37-year-old Novak Djokovic, Alcaraz lost, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4, and learned how to grapple with an opponent whose injury did not prevent him from playing at a world-historical level. 
At 4-4 in the first set, Djokovic slid hard while running to his right and seemed to tweak something in his left groin, causing him to grimace and stretch it out. On his next serve, he struggled to push off the ground with that leg. He lost the ensuing rally then shook his head at his player’s box, suggesting that he wasn’t right. Injury suddenly imperiled the most anticipated match of the men’s draw in Melbourne. After having his serve broken, Djokovic was evaluated by a physiotherapist, who took him off court to wrap up his left thigh. A doctor administered a dose of painkillers. Djokovic returned to the court and lost the first set to Alcaraz, who looked unfazed.</span>
