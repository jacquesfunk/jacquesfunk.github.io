                              <span>On Monday morning, English soccer&#x27;s referee association (PGMOL) announced that it had suspended Premier League ref David Coote after an odd video of him leaked online. In the video, Coote, who appears to be absolutely smacked off of some kind of intoxicating substance, chats some generationally compromising shit. Despite his earlier assertion that someone put a ton of effort into producing a bizarre fake video of a relatively obscure referee talking generationally compromising shit, Coote&#x27;s since admitted it was indeed him.

                              <span>Jaron &quot;Boots&quot; Ennis put himself in a KO-or-lose situation. So even while keeping his belt in what was a romp on the scorecards in Saturday’s IBF welterweight title fight against Karen Chukhadzhian in front of a hometown Philadelphia crowd, in the big picture Ennis hardly came away a winner. 
Over the summer, Ennis and his team booked what looked like a paid workout when he signed to face the Ukrainian, whom he’d already beaten by decision in January 2023 on the undercard of a Tank Davis fight. Boots had the title, the perfect record (32-0 with 29 knockouts), and a one-two combo of out-of-the-ring charm and on-the-job ferocity that put him in any conversation about boxing’s Next Big Thing. The 27-year old Philly native was maybe just one highlight-reel KO away from breathing the rare air that Tank breathes popularity-wise, hitting pay-per-view headliner status and getting what all boxers suddenly covet: An invite to Saudi Arabia. This was the fight that was supposed to get Ennis all that.</span>

                              <span>Manchester City loves to give rivals hope right before snatching it away. The four-peating Premier League champions started each of those consecutive title-winning campaigns with whimpers, relatively speaking, dropping at least eight points in Premier League play in each of them by about mid-November. Each of those stretches of (relatively) subpar play gave hope to everyone who supports a fellow title contender or simply (and justifiably) hates City&#x27;s whole deal. But, as the saying goes, it&#x27;s the hope that kills you, and City eventually crushed those hopes in each of those four seasons.
Right on time, the present day Citizens have entered the late-fall point of the schedule mired in a funk. Right now City sits in second place on the league table, having dropped 10 points in its first 11 matches. After a strong start to the campaign, the Mancs have hit the skids hard recently, currently stuck in a four-match losing streak across all competitions. The latest blow came in a come-from-ahead 2-1 loss to Brighton on Saturday.</span>

                              <span>Early in the second quarter of Sunday&#x27;s game between the excellent but joyless Boston Celtics and the talented but butt Milwaukee Bucks, Giannis Antetokounmpo kerpowed Jaylen Brown with a high elbow. Giannis had the ball on the block, drove to the defense&#x27;s middle, and then attempted to pivot over his left shoulder, throwing out a cartoonishly long and pointy chicken wing to clear some shooting space; Brown, the primary defender, took the blow to the shoulder and head, and went down with a shout. The referees signaled an offensive foul and awarded the ball to the Celtics. Giannis offered Brown a conciliatory handshake and then cruelly yoinked it away, executing the rude &quot;too slow&quot; hair-smoothing maneuver and leaving Brown grasping at air.

Today&#x27;s IOTD is Chet Holmgren&#x27;s fractured pelvis, which given that he just played in his 100th career NBA game Friday night almost sounds like he is using his grandfather&#x27;s bones to carry his skin. He contested an Andrew Wiggins shot less than six minutes into Sunday&#x27;s early season marquee stealer between Golden State and Oklahoma City and fell hard to the floor, limped off, and won&#x27;t even be evaluated again before mid-January at the earliest. Now that we&#x27;re all more seasoned in the way of evaluating injury evaluations, that means he won&#x27;t be back until early February.</span>

                              <span>A big, dense ball of gas that has fascinated mankind since the dawn of time, Jerry Jones is constantly innovating in the field of sabotaging his own team. Not content with letting paying customers watch Cowboys players poop, Jones has perfected a unique method of neutralizing players: blinding them with the awesome power of the Sun itself. Supervillain shit.
A wide-open CeeDee Lamb tried and failed to catch a second-quarter touchdown pass in Sunday&#x27;s 34-6 loss to the Eagles, and it&#x27;s not really his fault, since he had no idea there was a pass at all. The Sun, low in the standard-time skies and blasting through the huge glass windows at the opposite end of Cowboys Stadium, made sure of that.</span>

                              <span>If an accurate quarterback is a comfortable quarterback, then the Texans&#x27; pass rush made Jared Goff play like he was wearing cleats filled with Christmas tree needles for most of Sunday&#x27;s night contest against the Lions. A one-loss signal-caller who entered Houston on a record pace for completion percentage, who hadn&#x27;t thrown a ball to the wrong-colored jerseys since Week 3, looked without warning like a Lions QB from the old days, completing a season-low 50 percent of his 30 passes while tossing an increasingly confounding five interceptions as his boys trailed by as much as 23-7 in the second half. Still, all was forgiven in the end, as some Texan mistakes, a refocused offense, and a couple of clutch kicks all combined to deliver Detroit an inspiring comeback—26-23, with a walk-off field goal for the win. 
Most of what you need to know about Detroit&#x27;s offense is this: In their one loss this season, Week 2 vs. Tampa Bay, Goff threw the ball 55 times. In all other games leading into their primetime clash against Houston, he&#x27;d maxed out at 28. The two prongs that allow this offense to plug into a power source are running backs David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs, and their punishing runs behind a fearsome offensive line are what open up opportunities for Goff to find his receivers on play-action pass plays. But the Texans&#x27; pressure in the early going both suffocated the run and forced Goff into uncharacteristic errors. On the game&#x27;s opening drive, an energetic deflection by Jalen Pitre created a Jimmie Ward interception, and with the Lions down 13-7 in the second, Denico Autry got his hand on Goff while he threw and sparked a tip frenzy that eventually led to another Texans field goal. Detroit proceeded to go three-and-out on each of the next two drives, as Houston&#x27;s aggression disrupted Goff&#x27;s rhythm and refused to give him clear looks at his targets.</span>

                              <span>FLATBUSH, BROOKLYN – It was 74 degrees on Election Day; I wore bike shorts on the two block walk to my polling site. The iced coffee in my hand proved unwieldy as I scanned my ballot, the poll worker’s hands fluttering nervously nearby. By the time I completed my civic duty, I still had most of my coffee left, along with a mostly free afternoon. When I messaged my editor to get a vibe check for the day, she told me “For election coverage, I think nobody has a sense of what to write right now but then it will get either pretty easy or pretty hard.” It was as true then as it is now. 
But I had that strangely beautiful afternoon ahead of me. It was the kind of day that tricks everyone into believing they like summer in New York, except it was early November. My face and legs began to prick with heat as I settled onto a park bench and lit a joint. A pickup basketball game unfolded before me. A group of teens gossiped at a table nearby, shedding their black puffer jackets as the sun&#x27;s warmth intensified. I remembered a wish I’d made earlier that year, that this fall would be the most beautiful I’d ever witnessed. I wondered if it was a curse. In a group chat with my best friends, one of them, a culture editor at the New Yorker, said, “I hate to say this and I want to be wrong but I kind of think he’s going to win.” My legs began to burn; I pulled a book out of my bag, my jacket over my knees.</span>

                              <span>Everyone in the stadium at Texas Tech&#x27;s loss to Colorado on Saturday would have understood why Tech head coach Joey McGuire took it upon himself to seize a microphone and begin yelling at the home fans near the beginning of the fourth quarter. They would have seen what people watching at home did not, which was those fans throwing a bunch of garbage from the seats and onto the field while officials reviewed a Colorado sack that involved both a facemask penalty that was not called and a targeting infraction that first was, and then was overturned. While Dean Blandino explained to the TV audience what was happening, his traditional more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger tone was overtaken by something that sounded more like a Muppet that had been stuffed into a dryer against its will. That was McGuire, and he wanted everyone to knock it off.

                              <span>It is early enough in the college basketball season that nothing really feels consequential yet. Most of the programs that will matter in March are still tuning up teams that won&#x27;t, to the point where the scoreboard has kind of a pleasant abstraction to it. For every early match-up between North Carolina and Kansas—it really happened, on Friday night; Kansas won, it was a fun game—there are two that mostly serve to remind you what a vast and varied country this is. Kentucky and Bucknell? Arizona and Old Dominion? Auburn, but also Vermont? Provided you don&#x27;t look at the scores in those games, which were decided by a combined margin of 137 points in favor of the programs you&#x27;d expect, it&#x27;s kind of nice to think about. But it&#x27;s conceptual, in the ways that basketball games played before Thanksgiving tend to be.
So much of the season hasn&#x27;t happened yet that the broader stakes are not yet set, but it seems safe to say that Auburn&#x27;s convincing 74-69 road win over Houston on Saturday night will matter. Houston, which came into the game ranked fourth in the country, is very good; Auburn, which was ranked 11th, won by getting second-half buckets with striking efficiency against one of the best defensive teams in the country. What was abstract and unrepresentative about Auburn&#x27;s season-opening thrashing of Vermont—and they won that game 94-43, so that&#x27;s basically everything—looked sharper and more significant on Saturday. The performance vaulted the Tigers to the top spot on the KenPom rankings, just ahead of Houston; the inherently unstable admixture of transfer portal ronin and multi-star recruits, which could always become anything, looked like a (very good) basketball team.</span>

                              <span>Stripped of context, visiting soccer fans getting drunk and causing havoc ahead of a big continental match in Europe would be so routine as to be almost unworthy of mention. But the hooligans in this instance were supporters of the Israeli soccer club Maccabi Tel Aviv, and the residents of Amsterdam weren&#x27;t keen to their disruptive behavior, which meant that outlets like the New York Times and politicians like Joe Biden trained their focus on what happened and characterized it with their warped clarity.
After a few hours and several substantial edits, the Times&#x27; article about Thursday&#x27;s events has something approaching a comprehensive picture of what went down—though to get it, you still have to patch together a timeline from the facts scattered throughout the article. It all started on Wednesday, the day before the match, when a sizable number of Maccabi fans arrived into Amsterdam to watch their team take on Ajax in the Europa League. Coinciding with the Maccabi fans&#x27; arrival, pro-Palestinian activists assembled in Dam Square in protest of Israel&#x27;s ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in Gaza.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s a beautiful Friday in autumn and I am here to share some drama with all of you: the story of two big, beautiful female elephants whose long-simmering resentments boiled over into an all-out brawl over one of the most coveted gadgets (by pachyderm standards). Our story takes place at the Berlin Zoo, and names have not been anonymized to bring you the cold, hard truth of what can happen when two divas have a trunk-off.
Without any further ado, let me introduce you to the Asian elephants at the heart of this story.</span>

                              <span>Going online used to be an event. My early online experience was probably similar to many of our old millennial readers like me: I went into the house’s Computer Room, booted up the PC, waited the agonizingly long time it took for it to load, then opened up a program that allowed me to connect, via a phone line, to The Internet. It was a process; there was a distinctive grating sound involved. It was much different than carrying around the whirr of the world in my pocket at all times. It is not a particularly memorable experience when I unlock my phone or open up my laptop. Going online as a kid was something I had to plan for; I even had limited hours of access! I think it was 10 a month when I started. I can’t even imagine spending such little time online.
I don’t know if that’s good or bad. (It’s bad. It’s obviously bad.) I got online pretty early—I think it would’ve been 1994. We had AOL, which was basically online for babies. But I was 11, and so more or less a baby in computer years. I was so early on AOL that I was part of what became known as Eternal September: I was one of the early AOL users to begin looking at and posting in USENET newsgroups, messing up all the carefully cultivated norms that had been established over the years. I am pretty sure I had email alerts when I got a reply. All of which is to say that I have heard a voice from the computer tell me “you’ve got mail” more than I have heard basically any other sound in my life.</span>

                              <span>At some point early in the third quarter of Thursday night&#x27;s great game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Baltimore Ravens, I began to believe that it just wasn&#x27;t the Ravens&#x27; night. The game resembled many other Baltimore losses from the last couple years: bad defensive play, a lethargic offense, a bunch of unforced penalties. On top of that, star safety Kyle Hamilton went out with an ankle sprain and Lamar Jackson was stretching his apparently ailing throwing hand on the sidelines. It was 21-7 in the Bengals&#x27; favor at the time, and it seemed like things were only going to get worse.
But good teams make their own luck, and a fumble by the Bengals in Ravens territory set up a touchdown drive with yet another &quot;Lamar Jackson does something amazing against Cincinnati&quot; play, and also kick-started an onslaught in which the Ravens scored on every drive for the rest of the game. If not for some busted coverages from their highly bustable defense, the Ravens might have pulled away with the game the same way the Bengals threatened to at the beginning. But this is the AFC North, where things get wonky and close no matter what.</span>

Unfortunately, many other young NBA players are poop from the anus of fate.

We definitely know they won&#x27;t be playing each other in the Super Bowl because someone foolishly shoved them into the same conference 54 years ago. That’s a particularly egregious example of long-term vision impairment, but it also is what it is.
But also this is where Roger Goodell, the ginger banker who minds the money for the 31 descendants of Scrooge McDuck who run the NFL, could deliver a bold new idea that, if he sells it right, will land well with everyone in our fractured and shattered land. Namely, he could see to it that the Ravens and Bengals somehow are planted in the Super Bowl anyway, either by public fiat or quiet connivance. Given that we as a nation will clearly buy anything we&#x27;re told and nod in stupefaction, even a middling Svengali like Goodell could carry this off.</span>

                              <span>An electoral defeat like the one just suffered by Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party is guaranteed to keep the Recrimination Engine redlined throughout the weeks and months to come. Right now, it&#x27;s impossible to turn on the news, read a mainstream liberal publication, or scroll through social media without immediately being confronted with someone&#x27;s diagnosis of where it all went wrong for the Democrats, followed by a strident declaration about what needs to happen next.
The worst versions of this ritual are undertaken for the sake of self-preservation. Pundits and politicians are scrambling to define the terms of the defeat in whatever fashion will most easily allow them to hang onto their influence. This is why Bernie Sanders, who just spent the last four years enthusiastically stumping for Joe Biden and his administration, is suddenly reaming out the Democratic Party for having abandoned the working class. It&#x27;s why a pundit like Matt Yglesias, a liberal in name only who just watched the Harris campaign completely eat shit while running on the kind of centrist policies he has long championed, has to quickly invent a new reality in which Harris lost because she somehow wasn&#x27;t centrist enough.</span>

                              <span>Newsletterer&#x27;s Note: Each weekday, I send out a newsletter called The Cipher to Defector Pal-level subscribers, which has a recap of the blog day, links to other sites, and extra takes and bits from staffers. (You can change your newsletter preferences or upgrade your subscription at the My Account page.) Today, we are inexplicably locked out of Sendgrid, so everyone gets a bonus bit from Sabs.
Also, an announcement: Defector Trivia is happening on Twitch today at 5 p.m. ET. I would have put that in the newsletter, too.</span>
