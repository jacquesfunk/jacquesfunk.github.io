Boots had the title, the perfect record (32-0 with 29 knockouts), and a one-two combo of out-of-the-ring charm and on-the-job ferocity that put him in any conversation about boxing’s Next Big Thing. The 27-year old Philly native was maybe just one highlight-reel KO away from breathing the rare air that Tank breathes popularity-wise, hitting pay-per-view headliner status and getting what all boxers suddenly covet: An invite to Saudi Arabia. This was the fight that was supposed to get Ennis all that.",

          "description": "Manchester City loves to give rivals hope right before snatching it away. The four-peating Premier League champions started each of those consecutive title-winning campaigns with whimpers, relatively speaking, dropping at least eight points in Premier League play in each of them by about mid-November. Each of those stretches of (relatively) subpar play gave hope to everyone who supports a fellow title contender or simply (and justifiably) hates City's whole deal. But, as the saying goes, it's the hope that kills you, and City eventually crushed those hopes in each of those four seasons.\nRight on time, the present day Citizens have entered the late-fall point of the schedule mired in a funk. Right now City sits in second place on the league table, having dropped 10 points in its first 11 matches. After a strong start to the campaign, the Mancs have hit the skids hard recently, currently stuck in a four-match losing streak across all competitions. The latest blow came in a come-from-ahead 2-1 loss to Brighton on Saturday.",

Giannis had the ball on the block, drove to the defense's middle, and then attempted to pivot over his left shoulder, throwing out a cartoonishly long and pointy chicken wing to clear some shooting space; Brown, the primary defender, took the blow to the shoulder and head, and went down with a shout. The referees signaled an offensive foul and awarded the ball to the Celtics. Giannis offered Brown a conciliatory handshake and then cruelly yoinked it away, executing the rude \"too slow\" hair-smoothing maneuver and leaving Brown grasping at air.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6crt19V_mU",

          "description": "If an accurate quarterback is a comfortable quarterback, then the Texans' pass rush made Jared Goff play like he was wearing cleats filled with Christmas tree needles for most of Sunday's night contest against the Lions. A one-loss signal-caller who entered Houston on a record pace for completion percentage, who hadn't thrown a ball to the wrong-colored jerseys since Week 3, looked without warning like a Lions QB from the old days, completing a season-low 50 percent of his 30 passes while tossing an increasingly confounding five interceptions as his boys trailed by as much as 23-7 in the second half. Still, all was forgiven in the end, as some Texan mistakes, a refocused offense, and a couple of clutch kicks all combined to deliver Detroit an inspiring comeback—26-23, with a walk-off field goal for the win. \nMost of what you need to know about Detroit's offense is this: In their one loss this season, Week 2 vs. Tampa Bay, Goff threw the ball 55 times. In all other games leading into their primetime clash against Houston, he'd maxed out at 28. The two prongs that allow this offense to plug into a power source are running backs David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs, and their punishing runs behind a fearsome offensive line are what open up opportunities for Goff to find his receivers on play-action pass plays. But the Texans' pressure in the early going both suffocated the run and forced Goff into uncharacteristic errors. On the game's opening drive, an energetic deflection by Jalen Pitre created a Jimmie Ward interception, and with the Lions down 13-7 in the second, Denico Autry got his hand on Goff while he threw and sparked a tip frenzy that eventually led to another Texans field goal. Detroit proceeded to go three-and-out on each of the next two drives, as Houston's aggression disrupted Goff's rhythm and refused to give him clear looks at his targets.",

The iced coffee in my hand proved unwieldy as I scanned my ballot, the poll worker’s hands fluttering nervously nearby. By the time I completed my civic duty, I still had most of my coffee left, along with a mostly free afternoon. When I messaged my editor to get a vibe check for the day, she told me “For election coverage, I think nobody has a sense of what to write right now but then it will get either pretty easy or pretty hard.” It was as true then as it is now. \nBut I had that strangely beautiful afternoon ahead of me. It was the kind of day that tricks everyone into believing they like summer in New York, except it was early November. My face and legs began to prick with heat as I settled onto a park bench and lit a joint. A pickup basketball game unfolded before me. A group of teens gossiped at a table nearby, shedding their black puffer jackets as the sun's warmth intensified. I remembered a wish I’d made earlier that year, that this fall would be the most beautiful I’d ever witnessed. I wondered if it was a curse. In a group chat with my best friends, one of them, a culture editor at the New Yorker, said, “I hate to say this and I want to be wrong but I kind of think he’s going to win.” My legs began to burn; I pulled a book out of my bag, my jacket over my knees.",

          "description": "It is early enough in the college basketball season that nothing really feels consequential yet. Most of the programs that will matter in March are still tuning up teams that won't, to the point where the scoreboard has kind of a pleasant abstraction to it. For every early match-up between North Carolina and Kansas—it really happened, on Friday night; Kansas won, it was a fun game—there are two that mostly serve to remind you what a vast and varied country this is. Kentucky and Bucknell? Arizona and Old Dominion? Auburn, but also Vermont? Provided you don't look at the scores in those games, which were decided by a combined margin of 137 points in favor of the programs you'd expect, it's kind of nice to think about. But it's conceptual, in the ways that basketball games played before Thanksgiving tend to be.\nSo much of the season hasn't happened yet that the broader stakes are not yet set, but it seems safe to say that Auburn's convincing 74-69 road win over Houston on Saturday night will matter. Houston, which came into the game ranked fourth in the country, is very good; Auburn, which was ranked 11th, won by getting second-half buckets with striking efficiency against one of the best defensive teams in the country. What was abstract and unrepresentative about Auburn's season-opening thrashing of Vermont—and they won that game 94-43, so that's basically everything—looked sharper and more significant on Saturday. The performance vaulted the Tigers to the top spot on the KenPom rankings, just ahead of Houston; the inherently unstable admixture of transfer portal ronin and multi-star recruits, which could always become anything, looked like a (very good) basketball team.",

It all started on Wednesday, the day before the match, when a sizable number of Maccabi fans arrived into Amsterdam to watch their team take on Ajax in the Europa League.

My early online experience was probably similar to many of our old millennial readers like me: I went into the house’s Computer Room, booted up the PC, waited the agonizingly long time it took for it to load, then opened up a program that allowed me to connect, via a phone line, to The Internet. It was a process; there was a distinctive grating sound involved. It was much different than carrying around the whirr of the world in my pocket at all times. It is not a particularly memorable experience when I unlock my phone or open up my laptop. Going online as a kid was something I had to plan for; I even had limited hours of access! I think it was 10 a month when I started. I can’t even imagine spending such little time online.\nI don’t know if that’s good or bad. (It’s bad. It’s obviously bad.) I got online pretty early—I think it would’ve been 1994. We had AOL, which was basically online for babies. But I was 11, and so more or less a baby in computer years. I was so early on AOL that I was part of what became known as Eternal September: I was one of the early AOL users to begin looking at and posting in USENET newsgroups, messing up all the carefully cultivated norms that had been established over the years. I am pretty sure I had email alerts when I got a reply.

The game resembled many other Baltimore losses from the last couple years: bad defensive play, a lethargic offense, a bunch of unforced penalties. On top of that, star safety Kyle Hamilton went out with an ankle sprain and Lamar Jackson was stretching his apparently ailing throwing hand on the sidelines. It was 21-7 in the Bengals' favor at the time, and it seemed like things were only going to get worse.\nBut good teams make their own luck, and a fumble by the Bengals in Ravens territory set up a touchdown drive with yet another \"Lamar Jackson does something amazing against Cincinnati\" play, and also kick-started an onslaught in which the Ravens scored on every drive for the rest of the game. If not for some busted coverages from their highly bustable defense, the Ravens might have pulled away with the game the same way the Bengals threatened to at the beginning. But this is the AFC North, where things get wonky and close no matter what.",

          "description": "We have a pretty good idea that neither the Baltimore Ravens nor Cincinnati Bengals are going to the Super Bowl, if only because they're both far too fun to survive the difficult December/January gauntlet of bad-weather games and injuries that help make football the cruel and brutal slog it is. We definitely know they won't be playing each other in the Super Bowl because someone foolishly shoved them into the same conference 54 years ago. That’s a particularly egregious example of long-term vision impairment, but it also is what it is.\nBut also this is where Roger Goodell, the ginger banker who minds the money for the 31 descendants of Scrooge McDuck who run the NFL, could deliver a bold new idea that, if he sells it right, will land well with everyone in our fractured and shattered land. Namely, he could see to it that the Ravens and Bengals somehow are planted in the Super Bowl anyway, either by public fiat or quiet connivance. Given that we as a nation will clearly buy anything we're told and nod in stupefaction, even a middling Svengali like Goodell could carry this off.",

          "description": "An electoral defeat like the one just suffered by Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party is guaranteed to keep the Recrimination Engine redlined throughout the weeks and months to come. Right now, it's impossible to turn on the news, read a mainstream liberal publication, or scroll through social media without immediately being confronted with someone's diagnosis of where it all went wrong for the Democrats, followed by a strident declaration about what needs to happen next.\nThe worst versions of this ritual are undertaken for the sake of self-preservation. Pundits and politicians are scrambling to define the terms of the defeat in whatever fashion will most easily allow them to hang onto their influence. This is why Bernie Sanders, who just spent the last four years enthusiastically stumping for Joe Biden and his administration, is suddenly reaming out the Democratic Party for having abandoned the working class. It's why a pundit like Matt Yglesias, a liberal in name only who just watched the Harris campaign completely eat shit while running on the kind of centrist policies he has long championed, has to quickly invent a new reality in which Harris lost because she somehow wasn't centrist enough.",

You'll get one of those soon enough, but for the time being perhaps I could interest you in something more along the lines of \"Three guys trying to figure out what's wrong with various lousy NFL teams, as if they had no other care in the world.\" Also I got kind of upset about my co-hosts' bagel orders of choice, which is maybe small or ungenerous of me, but which I also stand by.",

His first head coach was Todd Bowles, who was fired at the end of his rookie season. His second head coach was Adam Gase, who is Adam Gase. His third head coach was Matt Rhule, who was fired early into Darnold’s second season in Carolina. And his fourth head coach (if you don’t count Steve Wilks, who took over the Panthers as interim coach after Rhule oozed back down to the college ranks) was Kyle Shanahan, who used him exclusively as a backup.

When it was announced, my first reaction was that this would just make the group stage—now called the league stage—even more tilted in favor of the big clubs on the continent. Whereas before, these clubs could be thrown in together in a group of death—like last season's Dortmund-PSG-Milan-Newcastle meat grinder—now, my theory went, they would just be able to mop up on a diet of weak clubs to secure a spot in the knockout rounds.",

It is a dynasty that will age and eventually expire, of course, because they all do, and maybe this will all collapse in a heap of spent tendons and uncontrolled rage. But dynasties can sometimes linger beyond their rational shelf life; San Antonio's fifth championship came seven years after its fourth. And every time the Warriors seem to flatline—the 2024 season, for one example—they rise up and remember themselves. What they remember, specifically, is not really that complicated. When the Warriors defend, they are truly dynastic. It’s not as easy as they make it look, but it is almost as simple as that.\nTheir 118-112 win over Boston last night was a fresh reinforcement of that essential truth. Yes, many folks will be distracted by Steve Kerr having the carte blanche to yell at Stephen Curry after Curry passed the mythical 3,000 career turnover mark, but all that has been true forever; Curry turnovers, Kerr getting cranky about it, Curry not making a thing out of getting yelled at, and so endlessly on.

It was the lesson of not just the outward simplicity of music, but the lineage and vast worlds contained within its grand history. It was a call to be a student of the art, just as much as a player.\nJones, who died on Sunday at the age of 91, leaves behind an enormous absence in entertainment. He was the ultimate connective tissue in making the greatest media of the last few eras of entertainment. He orchestrated Count Basie's band when they played for Frank Sinatra. He composed the theme for Sanford and Son, and scored films like In The Heat of the Night, The Italian Job, and The Color Purple. He produced The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, co-founded Vibe magazine, brought jazz and hip-hop together for his Back On The Block album. Off The Wall, Thriller, Bad—there is not one medium, genre, or business within entertainment that did not have Jones's hand in it. He was just as eager to teach the intricacies of making good music and art as he was to tell those ribald stories about Sinatra, Michael Jackson, or Prince. His death is not a surprise, but it is upsetting all the same, less because of what he's done and more because of how little the modern entertainment industry resembles the kind of place that fosters that kind of artistic talent and allowed him to thrive.",
