And with the bases loaded, two outs, and Justin Turner working Gil to a 3-0 count, Robles took off for home as Gil reached for his rosin bag, and was easily caught stealing to end the inning. It was the complete Robles experience. Here's a lovable guy with enough pathos to befriend a wild praying mantis, and also a guy who will follow it up with one of the worst base-running experiences you've ever witnessed, all within the very first inning of the game. The Mariners went on to lose 11-2, which is one point in Robles's defense: It probably wouldn't have mattered anyway.\nOn Thursday, the Mariners were tied 1-1 with the Yankees when, in the bottom of the 10th inning, Randy Arozarena struck out swinging on a dropped third strike. His bat went sailing over the third-base line and nearly took out Julio Rodríguez, who danced out of the way and then forgot that the ball was still in play. He took a wide jog about the base, turning to the dugout, while Jazz Chisholm Jr. stood on base and called for the ball. It took a few beats for Yankees catcher Austin Wells to make the throw, but Rodríguez was still doubled off easily. The Mariners went on to lose this game, 2-1.",

Watching the two make goo-goo eyes at each other from across the Pyrenees for four years straight bled the courtship of all its titillation, even now that they're finally fucking. The other part is probably a response to the infinitely impressive but still somewhat dulling nature of Madrid's success.

          "description": "Nightbitch is billed as a film about an overburdened stay-at-home mom who turns into a dog at night in order to free herself from her shackles. But it’s the night part rather than the bitch part that stands out here. This is a movie about a woman (Amy Adams) whose days have been stolen, who is pushed so far that the narrative has to contort into fantasy in order to break her out of her reality. This is her reality: Cast iron pan, sizzling butter, frozen hash brown, lunch with kid, walk with kid, library with kid, cast iron pan, sizzling butter, frozen hash brown, lunch with kid, walk with kid, library with kid. Time passes in blocks of repetition for this nameless mother who seems to exist only to complete the tasks that keep her child (not even herself) alive, one of countless Jeanne Dielmans pacing the planet, her identity absorbed by these mundane chores that mark the time ticking by and her life along with it. She seems barely there, even her epic earnest responses to outside questions about her life are only answered truthfully in her head, as she presents a frictionless surface. Or maybe not entirely frictionless. A slight grimace here, a pleading look there, something is starting to peek through the veneer. \nThis woman is so alone in this temporal hell that you are surprised when a man (Scoot McNairy) suddenly shows up. And this is the part of an otherwise generic-veering movie about the power of motherhood that stuck out in my mind. Because Nightbitch is the rare mainstream Hollywood movie that not only dissects a particular kind of passive male uselessness—in this case the father who is barely there and when he is there is barely there—but how that uselessness can actively prey on women’s time.",

          "description": "We here at Defector have made our affection for Girona well-known. Even with the City Football Group ownership angle, it's hard to deny that Girona breaking into the top three of La Liga last season was very cool. Hell, even as a Barcelona fan, I found myself pulling for a Gironiste title charge during the club's season-opening points barrage, when it led the league into January. Though winning La Liga turned out to be just a pipe dream, third place and a debutant spot in the Champions League was more than enough consolation for a club that isn't all that big, and one that often has served as a Manchester City feeder club.\nOn Wednesday, Girona made that Champions League debut in France, taking on the new-look Paris Saint-Germain—\"new look\" meaning \"no longer employs Kylian Mbappé\"—in the opening match of group ... well, there's actually no more group play in the Champions League. Love or hate the new format—I'm a centrist, leaning ever so slightly towards the hate side—the stated goal of the tournament is to get more games that matter on the calendar. (The unstated goal of the tournament is to simply get more games, and more money, on the calendar.) To have the French champions, a veritable juggernaut, take on the upstart Spaniards ... that's the type of match this new format was seemingly made for.",

          "description": "There is a time and place to unsheathe five-to-ten of your toes out in front of your coworkers. Perhaps in a group swimming situation or something like that. The general rule, however, is: If in public you be, your feet they shan't see. Jose Altuve failed to obey this maxim, and he was summarily ejected from a wild Astros win against the Padres for podiatric crimes.\nAltuve ended the top of the ninth inning by grounding out to third, stranding the go-ahead runner on second with the score tied at three runs apiece and giving San Diego a chance to walk it off. Houston's tiny second baseman did not even try to run to first, however, as he claimed he'd fouled the pitch off of his left foot. The video of the play (7:43 in the below highlight reel) shows pretty clearly that Altuve did bonk his own foot, though home plate umpire Brennan Miller wasn't having it. Despite the protestations of Altuve and his manager Joe Espada, the play was not reviewable and the initial ruling therefore stood—which did not stop Altuve from unsocking himself to present evidence. Miller drew the line at toe reveal, and ejected Altuve.",

Particularly on the most recent episode, where she is twisted by the arm to go along with using her only friend to pull a fast one on Pierpoint. Harper becoming the monster she was always born to be is a consistent theme of the series. Her revenge against Pierpoint, and specifically Eric, has been inevitable since the end of the second season. And both of her confrontations to end the episode, first with Eric, and then with Yasmin (more on that later), were excruciating to watch. It's hard to say she doesn't deserve it, but nobody on this show deserves anything good. They are soulless husks, obsessed with money and the power/exaltation of the sell above their own humanity. Nevertheless, Harper makes her big bet and for the time being it looks good, and that's what these people live for, at the expense of whatever personal relationships they claim to want.",

The show follows eight women who are part of a weird TikTok group they call MomTok, which is basically just them posting videos of themselves dancing in different configurations and maybe also proselytizing? \nThe three of us have been messaging constantly about the Mormon Mommies.

It does a favor to the people doing it, for one thing, because even assessing it along the lines of any other campaign decision provides a cosmetic coat of reason to something that hasn't earned it. More than that, there's no sense in searching for a justification when the people involved know that they are doing something that can't be justified. That is more or less why they're doing it, and any supposed tactical advantage should be understood as secondary to the primary purpose, which is to see what they can get away with, and to begin seeking permission in earnest for something that is (probably) still impermissible.\nThere was surely some calculation in J.D…",

For me that means watching \"NFL\" Hard Knocks, a show that goes inside the mind of the competition. This year \"NFL\" Hard Knocks had a whole season about some guys at the New York Giants who sit around in their unremarkable offices and look at computers with lists of players on them. First of all: Don't care. Second of all: Hey, where did you buy those office decorations—Office Depot? Is this a glamorous professional football operation, or a paper company based in Scranton, Pennsylvania? \nLet me tell you how I would decorate my office if I were to become the Head of Player Personnel for the Jacksonville Jaguar organization, something that many suspect is a distinct possibility. I would have a big office and in the corner is an ordinary-looking water fountain. When someone came in for a meeting I'd say, \"Have a drink from my water fountain. Oh, but it's not water in there—it's Red Bull.\" I would have a water fountain installed in my office that shoots out Red Bull instead of water. That would raise a few eyebrows, I bet.",

This being the case, it's rare to see a coach speak publicly about his starting quarterback in anything but encouraging terms. The most incapable bozo in the league can go out there and throw three picks, and his coach will still say stuff like It's not one person who wins or loses a game, or We believe [incapable bozo] is still the right guy to lead this football team. This is because most coaches know that publicly undermining an already-bad quarterback will only make things worse for himself.\nSo it's meaningful when a head coach, just two weeks into his tenure, has this to say about a play made by his signal-caller:",

There is a very normal way to get to 21 points, and it involves touchdowns, and Washington scored zero of those. There are several normal-ish ways to score 18 points, and all the ones you can probably think of include field goals, and the Giants had none of those because they didn't have a kicker. Just another Sunday afternoon for two very silly teams.\nIt was not exactly \"bad\" football, though both teams are generally very bad. It was farcical, and perversely entertaining, and maybe antifootball, but the players all performed competently. Do you know how NFL rules contain a few obscure, vestigial rules from the game's messy origins, rules that feel like they come out of a different sport altogether, because they do? On Sunday it was almost as if the Commanders and Giants were playing two entirely separate parallel universes' versions of football, one where touchdowns were never invented and one where placekicking is forbidden, and the clash of styles actually made for some pretty good drama. These two teams and their fans will take competitiveness wherever they can find it, I suppose.",

No rookie QB picked No. 1 overall in the past two decades had managed to start and win his team's opener, though Williams's success came in large part thanks to his defense and special teams. In the 24-17 comeback victory, nine points came from field goals, while the two touchdowns arrived courtesy of a blocked punt and this gift of an underhanded pick-six from a falling Will Levis. The No. 1 overall pick's stat line suffered from a distinct lack of pizazz—93 yards on 29 passes, 15 more on the ground—but a win was a win, and after an 0-4 start to the season last year, 1-0 felt pretty good for Chicago.\nOn Sunday night, however, Williams turned in a much more traditional tribute to David Carr's legacy, getting sacked a bunch of times in a loss in Houston. This was a tight game but not a pretty one—19-13 was the final, with only six total points scored in the second half—and as the Texans boosted themselves to 2-0 primarily off kicker Ka'imi Fairbairn's big beefy leg, they illuminated the uphill battle the Bears still face with the developing Williams at the helm.",

I find this way of thinking to be incorrect because I like Gerrit Cole, though in a way that's not always contingent on his continued success. He's a guy with a dad comportment who is very invested in labor and the MLB Players Association. He's one of the best pitchers of his generation. He is often one of the most informative pitchers to listen to talk after a start, especially a poor one. He sounds a bit like Kermit the Frog? His 2021 spider tack era proved so fascinating to me that I got in the graph mines for my own satisfaction.\nThis is not to say that I don't derive joy from his successful starts, it's just that it is not the only part of what defines a satisfying Cole game. To me, he remains narratively interesting as a hyper-competitive guy who has gone through ups and downs in recent years. It's hard to begrudge anyone their disaffection—he can be a bit of a heel on the field, but he's a well-constructed one who's generally chill off of it, and, most importantly, has a fatal flaw: Rafael Devers.",

Baku was Leclerc's race to lose on Sunday, and lose it he did, though not through the traditional Ferrari methodology of engine explosions, egregious strategy calls, or things of that nature. The race was a war of attrition that was, somehow, still won by the first pit stop.\nBut for all the pre-race chitter chatter about McLaren favoring Norris in team orders, a disastrous qualifying performance meant that Norris's chances at a win were infinitesimally low. Instead, it was his teammate, Oscar Piastri, who started P2. Leclerc pulled off the line cleanly, and quickly built a six-second gap to Piastri. But with the medium tires degrading quickly, the undercut became extremely powerful. Sergio Pérez—who, in spite of a horrible 2024, could be a zombie and still get a podium finish at Baku—was the earliest frontrunner to pit. He came out just behind Norris, who started P15 and was accordingly running a different strategy.",
