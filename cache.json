After losing 4-0 to Tottenham back in November, and the subsequent run of bad form that followed, City went into Arsenal's home ground on Sunday riding a bit of a high, relatively speaking. Though it had choked away a 2-0 lead to Paris Saint-Germain in the second-to-last Champions League league phase match, City has actually been on a bit of an upswing recently, winning six of its last eight matches across all competitions. In its most-recent match, a must-win against Club Brugge, City gave up the opener but ended up winning convincingly 3-1, thanks to a steady and ruthless second half. While I wouldn't have said that City is all the way back to its world-conquering ways, I wouldn't have been shocked if it went into North London and beat Arsenal, something it had done 12 times in a row in Premier League play between 2017 and 2023.\nThat being said, I am also not shocked at how the match actually went, as Arsenal played the most brutal of hosts—eat your heart out, Walder Frey—and stomped on City's slowly reanimating corpse to the tune of 5-1.",

Even his makeup reflected the mood, with his face daubed to a dull flaxen hue instead of his typical defiant goldenrod. Whatever it was that Judge Juan Merchan was saying from his courtroom in New York during Donald Trump's sentencing that day faded into a dull whistling sound. When the time finally came for him to speak, Trump strung together the same phrases he has uttered every time the subject of his criminal history comes into question. He had suffered an \"injustice,\" been through a \"very terrible experience,\" before landing on one of his favorites: \"It's been a political witch hunt.\" Persecuted and yet unbound, 10 days later the convicted felon was re-inaugurated to the most powerful political office on earth.\nI've been thinking of this moment a lot in the last two weeks as Trump, or his cadres of sycophants and sympathetic oligarchs and associated corps of sunlight-deprived grifters, have set about dismantling the American project with the speed and enthusiasm of a contestant on Supermarket Sweep.",

It had been a sleepy start to the game, with both teams combining to hit a mere 23 shots and commit 19 fouls in the first half. Basheer Jihad kicked some life into the Sun Devils at the beginning of the second half with a pair of dunks and a three-pointer to grab a five-point lead. Alas, it was not meant to be. Caleb Love, last seen hitting a ridiculous half court three to force overtime on way to a win against Iowa State Monday night, led the comeback hitting multiple threes as the Wildcats went on a run.\nThings were almost wrapped up with about 30 seconds left on the clock when Love was jawing with Arizona State's BJ Freeman under the hoop during an out of bounds play and, well, Freeman replied ... headfirst. Both were ejected, and Arizona State Coach Bobby Hurley yanked his team from the floor as the final buzzer sounded, bypassing the handshake line and customary pleasantries.",

Before he got up in front of the cameras and blamed the deadly midair collision between an Army helicopter and a passenger jet on diversity hiring, and before his vice president got up in front of those cameras and specifically argued that if a white person had contributed to the crash, it was because they were under the strain of working with unqualified minorities, there was his opening salvo of Jan. 6 pardons paired with the executive order denying the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship. And then the executive order calling trans identity a \"falsehood\" and saying it \"is not consistent with the humility and selflessness\" required for military service. And the executive order mandating \"patriotic education\" for primary and secondary schools built around the \"celebration of America’s greatness and history.\" And the memo ordering the Department of Transportation to \"give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average.\" And the unlawful and unconstitutional cutoff of federal grant spending, and the mass firing of the inspectors general, and the mass firing of the prosecutors who'd investigated Trump's previous apparent crimes, and—there was much more than that, and they've tacked on still more of it since the press conference, and anyone who claims to see anything in it other than intentional, comprehensive misrule by sadists and criminals and bigots is someone who is helping to bring it about.",

Fans kindly set the bar low—maybe she'll need a few days to get to full speed, no pressure—and then she clears it by a mile, reminding those fans just how much they’ve missed her. In the case of Laura Stacey, who hadn’t dressed for first-place Montreal’s past three games because of a lower-body injury, Victoire fans weren’t the only ones setting the bar low. When the team posted lines before Thursday night's home game against struggling rival Toronto, Stacey was listed on a line by herself, as a 13th forward. Surely, she was still working her way back.  \nBut Laura Stacey isn't one for seeing how it goes. The tireless power forward always plays like she’s making up for lost time. After last night, consider those missed games made up for. In the Victoire’s 4-3 shootout win, Stacey set up every Montreal goal herself and finished with three points in a decidedly un-13th forward-like 20 minutes of ice time. The win kept Montreal at the top of the PWHL standings as the league heads into next week's international break.",

          "description": "A line about the experience of reading, possibly first spoken by the young actor Zoe Colletti in the 2019 film adaptation of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, is that you don’t read a book, the book reads you. Applied to something other than haunted books, which was Colletti’s usage, the statement suggests that because each reader brings their unique point of view to a work of art, our experience of that book reveals something not just about the work but about ourselves. We find our own preoccupations loose in the pages of works that couldn’t possibly have taken notice of them. This is what makes reading fun.\nIn this way, it is entirely reasonable that Hoopla, Harry Stein’s 1983 baseball novel about demagoguery framed around the Black Sox conspiracy to throw the 1919 World Series in service to gamblers, seems very much like a work about the present moment. It’s a book that says very little of importance about baseball, but which does a great job of explaining how a country might come to find itself spending the better part of a decade as (mostly) unwilling participants in the Donald Trump Extended Universe. Hoopla depicts an America in which news and entertainment have become so thoroughly muddled and cynical that stories derived from human pleasure and pain, fortune and misfortune, have value only insofar as they can be torqued so as to serve one agenda or another. Truth still exists in this world, but it doesn’t really matter.",

Starting with 2017's Castlevania, a great show completely ruined by horrific allegations against its creator, and continuing with Arcane: League of Legends, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, and Castlevania: Nocturne—now with less horrible creators, I hope—the network has a solid enough pedigree to get me to check out shows based on games that I don't particularly care about.\nEnter Devil May Cry, a game series I almost entirely missed save for its fourth installment in 2008, which serves as the basis for a new anime coming out on April 3. The network teased the opening credit sequence for the adaptation on Thursday, and for a game series that started in 2001, the show leans into the era by picking a recognizable nu metal song as the backing track. Unfortunately, the song is Limp Bizkit's \"Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)\".",

Because, conventional or not—with his square jaw and Rossetti lips and little nose and cleft chin and blue eyes and thick straight hair and straight white teeth—Sebastian Stan is beautiful. What must it be like to walk through the world looking like that? It must do something to the way you move, the way you talk, the way you make decisions. Maybe there’s nothing to think about when it’s all you’ve known. But Stan has talked enough about struggling with his identity as a Romanian immigrant for the thought not to have occurred to him: the strangeness of everyone welcoming you in even when you are uncertain who you even are.\nConsidering his bold looks in films like I, Tonya…",

          "description": "Just over two years ago, Diana Matheson announced formal plans to create a professional women's soccer league in Canada. Matheson, who racked up 206 caps for the Canadian national team in her career of nearly two decades, was the first to pursue what is usually a given in countries with successful national teams: a domestic incubator for top talent. But the Canadian national team, which won Olympic gold in 2021, has almost exclusively relied on foreign leagues to develop elite players. \nIn the months since Matheson's efforts went public the Northern Super League, as it's now known, has released a final list of its six participating cities and committed to an April 2025 kickoff; it also, in October 2024, announced a standard player agreement which looks a lot like the NWSL's hard-fought 2024 collective bargaining agreement. It precludes a player draft, prohibits trades without player consent, and grants automatic free-agency at the end of contracts. It also guarantees a minimum salary of 50,000 CAD—about 36,500 U.S. dollars in 2024. Teams across the NSL have announced some splashy signings: CANXNT standout Quinn, newly un-retired Desiree Scott, and veteran goalkeeper Erin McLeod.",

The examples given by the therapists included Tucker wiggling so sheets would fall away to expose his penis during massages, Tucker brushing two therapists with his penis, and in three cases Tucker leaving what appeared to be ejaculate on the massage table. Management at two spas also confirmed to The Banner that they banned Tucker from returning after getting reports of inappropriate behavior from their massage therapists.\nThe massage therapists all said these incidents happened between 2012 and 2016; all spoke anonymously for fear of retaliation from the Ravens organization as well as fans. Most of the women did not know each other beforehand, The Banner reported, but they all provided similar details about what happened.",

I'd reached the point in life where purchasing a new phone was more of a chore than anything else. And besides, I loved my then-current phone, the iPhone 12 mini. I'd seen enough of the newer iPhones to know that they'd all pose challenges not just for my pockets, but for my hands. I'd recently discovered that contrary to popular belief, I'm not what anyone would describe as tall. My hands are proportional to my 64-inch frame; the webbed skin between my forefinger and thumb stretched, unfamiliar and unpleasant, whenever I had the misfortune of using someone else's Big Phone.

The Billikens men’s basketball team has been playing brilliant defense since starting Atlantic 10 conference play, and their 78-69 win over VCU on Tuesday night continued that trend. The Rams have been the best team in the conference this year; their offensive philosophy involves banging inside and making layups. The Billikens didn't really let them do either, as VCU shot just 32.8 percent on Tuesday; they ended up taking 31 threes and made just five.\nThe Billikens have been solid on defense all year, and a brick wall in conference play. Opponents are shooting just 21.3 percent from distance against them. The Billikens are coming around offensively, too, and there's reason to believe they could get even better; first-year coach Josh Schertz had the best-shooting offense in the country at Indiana State last year. But it’s on the other end where things are getting really interesting. Isaiah Swope and Robbie Avila, who followed Schertz from Indiana State to St. Louis, have stepped up their contribution on the defensive end.",

Powers often told her students about rabbits, which excrete a special form of poop called a cecotrope that is meant to be eaten, as the rabbits cannot absorb all the nutrients in their food in the first go-around. Her students, perhaps unsurprisingly, demonstrated a distinct enthusiasm for hearing more about poop-eating.\nAfter Powers retired from teaching, she wondered just how many animals ate their own poop. She had started an internship at the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, where she discovered just how frequently the zoo fields visitors' questions about animals eating poop. In one particular multi-species exhibit, a South American rodent routinely ate the food for and excrement of their monkey roommates. The monkey's food, and by extension, their poop, was high in vitamin D. The rodents quickly developed vitamin D toxicity, which mineralized their muscle tissues.",

It's impossible to conceptualize how fast 300 kilometers per hour is until you're on a train that fast. Even then, it's primarily visual: Until you look at the window and briefly shock the brain with parallax, a G-class high-speed rail train runs so smoothly that you may as well be held still in space. Then, another train runs in the opposite direction on the adjacent track, and in those few seconds that they pass one another, you can feel it: the brief moment when you go from 300 kilometers per hour in one reference frame to over 500 kilometers per hour in another.\nThe math is, at least, a little easier. To drive from Beijing to Rizhao would take roughly seven hours without traffic, over 400 or so miles. The G-class train we took a day after arriving in Beijing, a Fuxing train produced by state-owned rolling stock manufacturer CRRC, made the trip in about four very comfortable hours, much of which I spent on Wikipedia. (The new CR450 rolling stock, designed for operating speeds of 400 kilometers an hour, is expected to enter service this year. CRRC also has a subsidiary based in Massachusetts, with a rather unfortunate record when it comes to delivering on its contracts with various American urban metro systems, like the MBTA and SEPTA.)",
