The fast-food chain also reveals a $3.99 Chicken Sandwich deal.\n\nPotato Wedges were launched in the mid-1990s and are back after being discontinued in 2020. They're lightly battered and seasoned. They are not replacing Secret Recipe Fries, which are still available.\nHot & Spicy Wings are deep-fried wing segments featuring a spicy marinade and a double hand-breading in KFC's Extra Crispy flour. They were last seen two years ago as a limited-time offering.\nThe two returning menu items are featured in a six-piece wings and wedges combo that includes a medium drink. They can also be purchased a la carte.\nKFC's $3.99 Chicken Sandwich deal is available now for a limited time at participating locations nationwide. The KFC Chicken Sandwich is normally $5.99 (may vary by location) and consists of an Extra Crispy chicken breast filet, pickles, and mayo or spicy mayo on a toasted brioche bun.\nOther deals on tap at KFC include:\n- $20 Wings & Wedges Fan Favorites Box - 10 Hot & Spicy Wings, 12 KFC Chicken Nuggets, Potato Wedges, four biscuits, and four dipping sauces for $20.\n- $10 Tuesdays - Continuing its run, the deal offers eight pieces of classic fried chicken or eight Original Recipe Tenders for $10 on Tuesdays.\nFinally, starting September 4, 2025, KFC will be offering an online-only 20 Wings for $20 deal. For the price, you get 20 Hot & Spicy Wings and four dipping sauces of your choice. The deal is only available through the KFC website or mobile app.\nPhoto via KFC.\nRead more at Brand Eating!",

          "description": "Wendy's Wednesday Meal of Misfortune is a meal themed after the Wednesday Netflix show. It includes 10 chicken nuggets (classic or spicy), two random mystery dipping sauces (\"Dips of Dread\" because they're spicy), small fries, and a small \"Raven's Blood\" Frosty.\n\nThe meal cost me $9.99.\n\n\n\nThe Wednesday Meal of Mistfortune is the same as a small 10-piece nuggets combo (which costs $9.79 at the same location), but with the new mystery dipping sauces and the new Frosty instead of a fountain drink.\nThe chicken nuggets were hot with a good crispiness and moist interior. I went with the classic version to better get a taste for the sauces.\n\n\n\nI received a dark red sauce that looked like a berry sauce, but turned out to be a spicy ketchup (a spicy berry sauce would have been more interesting), and a greyish pink sauce that turned out to be a spicy mayo. Interestingly, the ketchup was slightly spicier, but both were medium in terms of heat. Flavorwise, there wasn't more than you typically get from ketchup or mayo. There wasn't any extra hit of seasonings or herbs. They went well enough with the nuggets and the fries.\n\n\n\nThe Raven's Blood Frosty is available with a Vanilla or Chocolate Frosty base and is swirled with a dark cherry sauce. It came with a themed purple spoon. I went with the chocolate but regretted it. It was fine when I ate some Chocolate Frosty by itself, and the cherry sauce by itself had an enjoyable sweet cherry flavor. However, eating the two together made my mouth unhappy. The combination just wasn't jiving. I think the chocolate was too mild, maybe.\n\n\n\nOverall, Wendy's Wednesday Meal of Misfortune turned out nicely from a thematic standpoint. There was a special bag and all the food came in themed containers--even the stylized spoon came in a special wrapper. The new dips (I was only able to try two out of four, and they're given randomly), while interesting in terms of appearance, were less so in terms of taste.\nRead more at Brand Eating!",

          "description": "P.F. Chang's welcomes its new \"Freakier Flavors\" menu inspired by Disney's recently released Freakier Friday movie. Interestingly enough, the original Freaky Friday included a fictional House of Chiang restaurant (which sounds similar to P.F. Chang's), which the new menu pays tribute to.\n\nP.F. Chang's new Freakier Friday-themed menu includes:\n\n\nHouse of Chang's Spicy Chicken Dinner Special - Chang's Spicy Chicken served with white rice and an egg roll.\nMix It Up Mongolian Beef Dinner Special - Mongolian Beef served with white rice or lo mein and a house salad.\nSwitcheroo Refresher - Mango-orange lemonade that changes color and shimmers.\nCrystal Ball Refresher - A mix of desert pear, lemonade, Sprite, and club soda that changes color and shimmers.\nPink Slip Ube Cheesecake - Vanilla cheesecake base topped with a creamy, nutty ube layer, made from purple sweet potato (ube), and topped with edible pink glitter.\n\n\nThe Freakier Flavors menu is available now for a limited time at most P.F. Chang's locations nationwide through September 2, 2025.\nPhoto via P.F. Chang's.\nRead more at Brand Eating!",
