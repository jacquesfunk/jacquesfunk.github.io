          "description": "The most important thing to know about both the chittering Renfields gnawing through the ductwork of the American administrative state and the billionaire sociopath they serve is that they don't care. Every bit of damage they have done and will do springs from and follows this fundamental fact. They don't know anything about what they're wrecking, naturally—these are creatures that do and eat and shit on things, not ones that know—but it is more salient that they don't care enough even to try to know anything about it. They are busy and stupid in a way that mirrors their rancid imago—hardcore in a way that is mostly just erratic and impatient, secretive but grandiose, prissily paranoid, conducting their nasty business on an amphetamized and whimsical timetable—but they are also not really doing anything for the reasons that people or institutions do things.\nThey do not care about or understand the state because they do not acknowledge that it is valid; they do not care about or understand public service or public servants because they refuse the premise that such things could even exist. This goes beyond the private sector's familiar and self-flattering disdain for the public sector, which amounts to the load-bearing assumption that everything and everyone operating outside of the free market is somehow the minor leagues. There is another opposition at work here, a crabbed and curdled worldview that reflects libertarianism's signature balance of ideological resentment and pure childish certitude, and which is defined by the smash-and-grab anti-ethos of the vandal, but which is finally simpler and stupider than either.",

Both teams were struggling to make free throws, finish layups, or just hold onto the ball long enough for an actual shot to go up. It was, at times, a very rough watch. But the finish made up for all of it.\nThe sloppiness was a key factor in how Brooklyn, a team that likely won't make the play-in, snatched a 99-97 win away from Houston. Walking out of the arena afterward, one fan within earshot compared it to Reggie Miller's eight points in nine seconds against the Knicks. That comparison felt a bit too ambitious, but \"six points in six seconds from two players\" is tough to capture eloquently.",

In his time he's built some of the world's biggest Tesla coils, huge towering transformers that throw off terrifying webs of crackling electricity. Working for a decade out of the since redeveloped American Steel Studios space in West Oakland, and now just plying his plasma skills wherever there's an empty tarmac, Leyh has imagined and tested and fabricated and tinkered with many a device that you or I might reasonably mistake for a doomsday weapon. One of these projects, which Leyh has been working on for 30 years, is a by-God plasma cannon, a huge gun that fires a 180,000-volt blast of hell-fire a distance of about 35 feet. \nPlasma, as you know, is at the extreme bitchin' end of all science. You can make it in your microwave if you don't mind blowing up your microwave, and possibly your home, but it is also the stuff they brew up inside of tokamak reactors. Plasma is what kerplodes out of a fuel-stuffed diamond-lined hohlraum after it's been bombarded by 192 freakin' lasers. It's what forks out of a thunderstorm with annihilating fury and chases every living thing for miles around under cover. In China last month researchers at the EAST nuclear fusion reactor fired up a plasma hotter than the interior of the Sun and held it in a steady state for just shy of 18 minutes, making that plasma more than twice as old as the second-oldest human-made plasma of this kind ever to have existed.",

The news that Hoberg would be disciplined broke in June last year, though he appealed the decision then, denying that he bet on baseball.\nAccording to MLB's investigation, Hoberg had shared a legal sports betting account with a friend he met at a poker tournament in 2014, and, after sports betting was legalized in Iowa in 2019, asked his friend to place non-baseball bets for him. His friend, a professional poker player, did bet on baseball, and later shared his account log-in with Hoberg. (Communication was done over Telegram; both Hoberg and his friend deleted their conversation logs after MLB's investigation began, because, according to Hoberg, he was embarrassed by the volume of his bets.) When Hoberg opened a sports betting account in his own name, the operator flagged that Hoberg's device was also associated with another account that had bet on baseball, and MLB opened an investigation.",

Books about how to make money are so popular they could constitute a separate genre. It might seem as if this appetite for self-improvement and creative enlightenment is baked into America itself.

We now have the technology to imbue stick figures with strength, mobility, and guard skills. You'd be hard-pressed to identify an elite prospect under 6-foot-4. In such a world, the best player on the New York Knicks seems almost like an act of defiance. Small, dense, and inexorable, Jalen Brunson is a rock tumbling down a hill. He'll kick up off a tree root, squash a small weed, and get jostled by the changing curve of the slope. But he'll always create a path through any resistance.\nI'm convinced that Brunson's official 6-foot-2 listing is one of the league's many fake measurements. He might land two inches shy of that, and has approximately the bodily proportions of a thumb. He doesn't get too high off the ground, and he doesn't run all that fast. What he does is weaponize what must be the lowest center of mass of any NBA star. He hunches over the ball, protecting it with the cave of his body, backing his way into the post. When he turns to face up, he'll use his shoulders to batter and dislodge his bigger opponents; where necessary, he will even use a noggin so big that his teammates wear colossal hats to mock it.",

          "description": "The NBA's Western Conference is being weird right now. The two teams that made last year's conference finals—both younger teams thought to be on the rise—have now made themselves sharply worse with trades: The Timberwolves, by swapping Karl-Anthony Towns for a couple of grumpy and ill-fitting Knicks role-players; and now the Mavericks, by dumping the future of their franchise for a few post-prime* years of the broadly unreliable Anthony Davis. The Kings, Suns, and Warriors are in various states of crisis; the Nuggets are being hunted down by math; and the two Los Angeles teams are stalled out in also-ran-hood, pending unlikely runs of good health. Even the Spurs, who seemed a month ago to have arrived at feistiness ahead of schedule, are lately sagging back into lottery territory. \n*Here's a wild statistic, from Dan Devine of Yahoo Sports: Since Davis's arrival in Los Angeles in 2019, the Lakers have outscored opponents by just four total points in the nearly 4,600 minutes that Davis has played without LeBron James on the court beside him.",

          "description": "The two seismic NBA trades that took place over the weekend involved four Western Conference teams scattered across the standings. What links the deals together is that they both represent, to different degrees, bets on Victor Wembanyama.\nThe San Antonio angle is more obvious, but let us first consider the temporal rejiggering aspect of the Luka Doncic–Anthony Davis turbodeal. One theory of the Mavericks' decision to trade the best player on a team that made the Finals eight months ago is that they would be better set up to win big this year with Davis, as old as he is, than with Doncic, as injured as he currently is. Dallas clearly peeked up the standings, saw a largely untested Oklahoma City team that struggles with size—I'd note this premise is flawed since Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein have yet to be healthy at the same time this season, but we are adopting the Nico Harrison position for this exercise, so—followed by the even more untested Rockets, a bizarro Grizzlies team that plays a Eurobasket style untested in the playoffs, the somewhat rickety Nuggets, and a bunch of teams with a bunch of old guys, and concluded that they could make a real run at contention right now. I don't think it's a stretch to think that Dallas also peeked down the standings and felt motivated to slam down the accelerator given the looming threat of Wembanyama, especially now that his Spurs are operating like a contender instead of a purpose-built lottery dweller.",

Not to get all conspiracy-brained, but none of it passed the smell test, and it didn't help that various commentators seemed to have the same talking points explaining the trade, all of it revolving around Luka Doncic being so fat that when he sits down, he swallows the whole arena, or something.

          "description": "Friday afternoon saw the official announcement of the latest coup Saudi Arabia has struck against the traditional soccer establishment. Jhon Durán, Aston Villa's impossibly cool backup striker, is headed to Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr, which has acquired the Colombian's services for a reported transfer fee of €77 million. The move is just the latest escalation of an ongoing trend that has seen dozens of legitimately top-level talents eschew Europe's big leagues in favor of Saudi Arabia's big bucks. Like all those other moves, this one sucks ass.\nThe word \"unprecedented\" has already been attached to several previous transfers into the SPL, but it needs to be trotted out once again to describe the Durán move. This one's a lot like the Gabri Veiga transfer, only much, much more significant. Veiga was (and I guess still is?) a young prospect with genuine potential to one day reach the elite of the elite, but was not yet of serious interest to the top clubs as anything other than a flier. Durán, in contrast, has already gotten the big boys' tongues wagging. He's proven his scoring prowess in the best league in the world. He's played, and played well, in the Champions League. He's probably the single best U23 striker prospect in the world. West Ham and Chelsea both came close to signing him last summer, and his star has only risen since then. Aston Villa didn't hesitate to slap down the £57 million bid West Ham sent for Durán about a week ago, no doubt expecting that in a mere matter of months even bigger clubs—the likes of Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, and Barcelona have all reportedly been keeping a close eye on him—would come offering even bigger money. Anyone who pays attention to this stuff would've predicted that, by this time next year, Durán would have been either the face of Aston Villa's attack or the splashy new signing of one of Europe's perennial contenders. Veiga could've maybe, eventually gotten to where Durán is now, right on the doorstep of the soccer elite. And yet Durán, like Veiga, turned away.",

After losing 4-0 to Tottenham back in November, and the subsequent run of bad form that followed, City went into Arsenal's home ground on Sunday riding a bit of a high, relatively speaking. Though it had choked away a 2-0 lead to Paris Saint-Germain in the second-to-last Champions League league phase match, City has actually been on a bit of an upswing recently, winning six of its last eight matches across all competitions. In its most-recent match, a must-win against Club Brugge, City gave up the opener but ended up winning convincingly 3-1, thanks to a steady and ruthless second half. While I wouldn't have said that City is all the way back to its world-conquering ways, I wouldn't have been shocked if it went into North London and beat Arsenal, something it had done 12 times in a row in Premier League play between 2017 and 2023.\nThat being said, I am also not shocked at how the match actually went, as Arsenal played the most brutal of hosts—eat your heart out, Walder Frey—and stomped on City's slowly reanimating corpse to the tune of 5-1.",
