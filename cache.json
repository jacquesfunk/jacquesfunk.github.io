He weathered injuries and training-camp battles at one of the more volatile, confounding positions in football. So his mere appearance in Sunday night’s Wild Card game and his doinked-in game-winning field goal made him an appropriate hero for the Cardiac Commanders, who have now won five straight games on the final play from scrimmage.\nAs a euphoric London Fletcher put it on the Commanders radio call, Gonzalez “kick[ed] in the door and kick[ed] us into the second round of the playoffs” in the team's 23-20 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. After the game, Gonzalez said he’d been dealing with some hip discomfort during his previous kick, but that he felt good about the attempt as it left his foot. “I’m just a small part of a big plan,” he told reporters, adding that he was excited to get home to his wife and newborn son.",

And yet it makes perfect sense, and is somehow exactly as obvious, that the Cowboys fired McCarthy on Monday, the next-to-last day of their exclusive negotiating window with him. I mean, that's how you figured it would go, right—one way or another, the team would find the dumbest thing to do, for the dumbest reason, and do it at the dumbest time. That is the Cowboy Way. And when we say \"Cowboys,\" we mean of course Jerry Jones.\nNow you may find that firing McCarthy has its merits; this would especially be true if you somehow saw him as the only thing keeping the Cowboys from their true place at the center of the football universe, which is a denial of both logic and Jones's position as owner/general manager/godhead/glowering presence. This past season alone, McCarthy was up for a new deal after going 3-2 in the first five weeks, fired a million times when they lost the next five in succession, guaranteed a new deal a million and one times because the team then won four of their next five games to get to the edge of playoff contention, and then just left to sear evenly on the hot seat because nobody could figure out how to decipher the two losses at the end of their season.",

That team stinks real bad: After a cute 2022–23 season of pretending not to tank under then-new team CEO Danny Ainge, the Jazz have decided to suck shit for a while, and entered Sunday's home tilt against the Brooklyn Nets with the second-worst record in the Western Conference. They'll get down to the bottom soon enough, provided Zion Williamson of the New Orleans Pelicans can stay ambulatory for a few weeks. Collier, who was taken by the Jazz with the 29th pick in the 2024 draft, is certainly doing his part.\nCollier came to the Jazz from USC, where as a hot-shot one-and-done freshman he shared the spotlight with Bronny James on a distressingly Fortnite-coded operation, earning with his chaotic and eyeball-searingly unethical style of play a reputation as someone you dearly hope will never wear the jersey of your favorite professional hoops team. Collier entered Sunday's home game against the Brooklyn Nets shooting 32 percent from the floor and 16 percent on three-pointers, and turning the ball over on more than a third of his possessions. Attention to detail is not yet a strength of his game. This all suits the purposes of a team that wants to lose, even if it sometimes drives his coach and veteran teammates to hysterics.",

          "description": "In some ways, my worst nightmares about Russell Westbrook joining the Denver Nuggets have come true: He has wormed his way into the starting lineup; he has usurped the point guard position from Jamal Murray; he is shooting the ball quite often; he is shooting threes; Michael Malone loves him. And yet as all of this has happened, as Westbrook's role with the team has grown larger and more important, the Nuggets have gotten ... better? Just what the hell is going on here?\nThings didn't start off so well. At the beginning of the season, Westbrook was ensconced in the second unit, and entrusted to keep the offense humming while Nikola Jokic sat on the bench. The non-Jokic minutes have always been a disaster for the Nuggets, but Westbrook was just making things worse. His early-season stints were full of the smoked layups, ill-advised jumpers, and reckless playmaking that came to define his seasons in Los Angeles and marked him as a candidate for ignominious retirement this past offseason. But then injuries started to bite the team, which shuffled Westbrook into the starting lineup, and from there the Nuggets just kind of stopped losing. The 23-15 Nuggets are 13-4 in games that Westbrook has started, and it's not by coincidence. As a starter Westbrook is averaging 15 points, seven rebounds, and eight assists per game. He's also getting two steals per game as a starter, and shooting 53 percent from the field.",

But in the Chargers–Texans AFC Wild Card game, a fever dream befitting the Saturday afternoon TV window, both teams seemed determined to show the quarterbacks just how little they mattered. \nBy the start of the fourth quarter, things were getting downright goofy. Down 23-6 to the Texans and fresh off back-to-back interceptions, Justin Herbert took two quick sacks to set up third-and-forget-about-it inside his own 15. On the next play, rookie receiver Ladd McConkey made a grab in traffic and shook a sticky defensive back loose for an 86-yard house call. Leave it to the Chargers to score a four-point touchdown. Texans special teams blocked the extra point, evidently spooked kicker Cameron Dicker into forgetting the rules of football (he tried batting the ball down as if that might get the play whistled dead), and returned the blocked kick for the first defensive two-point conversion in playoff history. Even when the Chargers offense found the end zone, the Texans defense said it would have to be on their terms.",

The Steelers managed to outscore the Ravens 14-7 in the second half, securing a respectable-if-you-squint 28-14 final score. But everything that happened in the second half of this game—all those nice passes Russell Wilson threw to his receivers—was perfunctory, because by halftime the Steelers had already been run over and left for dead.\n\"Run over\" is not a metaphor in this instance. There is simply no other way to describe what happened to the Steelers through the game's first two quarters, in which the Ravens built a 21-0 lead. After the Steelers ended the first drive of the game with a punt, the Ravens went on a 13-play, 95-yard drive that ended in a touchdown and ate just over seven minutes off the clock. The Ravens ran the ball on nine of those 13 plays, and it became immediately clear that the Steelers' defense was incapable of stopping the Ravens' ground attack. Derrick Henry's first big run of the game went for 34 yards and came as the result of a direct snap. It was a play that augured what was to come: The Ravens' offensive line creating huge gaps for Henry to run through, and Henry dishing out physical punishment to any defender brave enough to try and tackle him. I guess you could say Henry used a stiff arm on Minkah Fitzpatrick to gain a few more yards at the end of that run, but it was really more of a punch.",

And both fish are in the news this week.\nThese two species collided in the news for seemingly different reasons—the darter starred in a new paper arguing it is actually not a distinct species, and the smelt was unlucky enough to become the subject of a tenuously coherent response from Donald Trump to a question about the L.A. wildfires. Two odd little fish making national headlines in one week might seem like a coincidence, but these fish are more entangled than they'll ever know. (How could they know? They're fish.)

Jags, Jets, and Brownies are the buzzkill of this century, and they will all be ordered to infect Tottenham and Wembley Stadiums this coming fall in what under normal circumstances would be considered an act of war.",

          "description": "DALLAS — I’m a punk who’s been in many mosh pits in my lifetime. Never have I experienced a media scrum that felt more like a mosh pit than the one surrounding Roki Sasaki’s agent Joel Wolfe at MLB’s Winter Meetings. The presser moved quickly, not just in terms of the brisk cadence of questions and answers but physically moved—from a corner in the Hilton Anatole’s Grand Ballroom, which acted as the media workroom, onto the stage with the podium and the MLB logo backdrop. Journalists followed Wolfe until they were crowding around the stage like they were at a basement show.\nWolfe addressed the scrum with a microphone that didn’t always work—adding to the DIY show feel, come to think of it—while fielding but not quite answering questions about where the most interesting international free agent in years would be likely to sign. That, honestly, is where the comparison to a punk show ends. Everything else is pure transactional offseason baseball, with a generous side order of rules—all of it just about the least punk thing imaginable.",

          "description": "We are now assured of 10 more days of Notre Dame in our faces, and ridiculously, that means another 10 days of hearing how the Irish not being tied to a conference like all the poor schools is an unfair advantage. I mean, what other program has a kicker with a chiropractor on call to come in every week and keep his bones aligned?\nThe kicker in question, Mitch Jeter, hit a 41-yard field goal with 12 seconds left to give the Irish a 27-24 victory in a highly disjointed game that for three quarters looked like it should have been played in a rainstorm. The chiropractor in question, Andrew Jeter, is his dad, who flew in each week to work on his son's directionally challenged leg after a hip injury. The conferences that Notre Dame are not in, the story goes, mean they don't have to share their playoff payoff with anyone else, giving them a leg up to keep Jeter's leg up.",
