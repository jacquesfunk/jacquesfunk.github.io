          "description": "The aesthetics of cycling are rarely so direct, but one thing I've been struck by through the first 17 stages of a fantastic Vuelta a España is how great Primoz Roglic looks riding a bike. As the peloton churned up the ridiculous slopes of the Pico Villuercas, basically a paved goat path with the dimensions of a long Koppenberg, everyone was pedaling squares, yet Roglic was the epitome of calm, his chest never heaving, his posture less rigid than coiled, his balance indisputable. When Lennert Van Eetvelt opened up the sprint, he rocked violently over his bike, his right elbow jutting out every time he raised his right foot, while Roglic's head appeared to stay in the same place as he timed his leap to perfection and came around an already-celebrating Van Eetvelt to take the stage and the leader's jersey.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0v73RYkr9c",

This was silly for multiple reasons. To begin with, starting in high school, I made a habit of exchanging breakfast for 20 minutes of extra sleep, and have mostly kept it ever since. Even more embarrassingly, there already existed a place in Philly that offered all the accoutrements of my ideal breakfast, one that I had even been inside—only I'd made the mistake of thinking that it was purely a bakery joint and limited myself to snacks: sesame balls, the like.\nThe place is called Heung Fa Chun Sweet House, between Arch and Cherry on 10th St., but this isn't a restaurant review. Like you need me to tell you that it's good, or cheap, or that the interior layout is some humble affair, when the point at hand here is that I spent a full year hankering on about \"really craving some 油條 right now, man I could really go for some 油條 right now,\" not knowing that I could get some 油條 posthaste with only two ounces of further research—or, say, looked at the menu on the wall when I entered. But if you were, hypothetically, going to find yourself at Heung Fa Chun Sweet House, or any other place that has my three necessary breakfast pillars, here is what to order.",

          "description": "Most skinks look like skinks, by which I mean that most of the 1,500 or so species in the family of lizards we call skinks have the same general body plan. Skinks have no discernible neck and squat little legs. Their heads are shaped like cones and their tails are long and tapered. They have smooth, overlapping scales, like a fish. As far as appearances go, they are a predictable bunch of lizards.\nBut there is one funky group of skinks in—you guessed it—Australia that have bucked skink convention and evolved some relatively unorthodox bodies. Now, a group of researchers have published a paper in Current Biology explaining exactly how these weird skinks got so weird. \"They have some really kind of extreme morphologies, things that I would kind of say are bizarre,\" said Ian Brennan, an evolutionary biologist at the Natural History Museum in London and the Australian National University in Canberra. \"But it's not really fair to call them bizarre, I guess.\"",

          "description": "At Barcelona, hell is other players. There is no time when the abject state of the club is more apparent than during the transfer window, when Barça, with the help of its media parrots, sells to its perpetually gullible supporters fantasies of lavish spending sprees to bring in the biggest of names. The fantasies are often unrealistic at best and dangerous at worst in light of the club's teetering finances, which still haven't recovered from the time when Barcelona actually did have cash to splash, and did so so extravagantly and fruitlessly that the club damn near drowned. In its efforts to make good on the self-generated hype, the club, again with the help of the parrots, attempts to alienate much of its existing squad, who upon joining were themselves sold a dream of being a key cog in the resurrection of a great club, only to be callously shunted off into the unwanted list and pressured into leaving town.\nThe players Barça winds up signing, after scaring up funds by finding new Peters to rob to keep the Pauls away, are typically underwhelming and ill-suited to address the squad's shortcomings, so much so that even on the day of their unveiling you know you're only a window or two away from them too being lumped atop the discard pile. It's only when the transfer window shuts, the fantasies are dispelled, the disappointment becomes solid and inert, and the roster is more or less set, that Barça fans are spared direct confrontation with all that is ugly with the club as a whole and can begin to find whatever enjoyment there is in the team itself.",

          "description": "It was hardly a mystery to anyone familiar with any of the parties involved, but the last moments of Tuesday night's game between the Dodgers and Angels was precisely why the Dodgers committed a billion dollars to Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts. It's good business, because these are good players, but it's a nice ancillary benefit that doing so was guaranteed to make Ron Washington cry and Arte Moreno to re-re-revisit his decision not to sell the Los Angeles Angels. And so it did.\nBut let's provide the minimal context you expect from us. It was the top of the 10th inning, in a 2-2 game between the Dodgers and their exact opposites from down the highway; Washington had just spent his ridiculous bullpen heat-bringer Ben Joyce to escape the ninth inning, which ended with a swing and a miss on a fastball traveling at 105.5 miles per hour. For the tenth, Washington had to bring in Roansy Contreras, whose particular hell is that he has earned his MLB pension as a Pirate and Angel. Tommy Edman had been dropped at second base as the discourtesy runner, which left Contreras to navigate the bottom three hitters in the Dodgers order. Easy enough, we suppose, because the one thing Contreras (and definitely Washington) needed not to happen was to have to face Ohtani with an open base.",

The last group are the globular springtails, which are \"dumpy in shape,\" write two researchers from Virginia Tech in a pamphlet.

          "description": "Strictly speaking, many of baseball's starting pitchers have more pitches in their arsenals than they need. I'm not complaining! Take Shota Imanaga, the delightful 31-year-old rookie southpaw for the Chicago Cubs: Statcast says Imanaga has used eight distinct pitch types this season, including a four-seam fastball that he's thrown a whopping 53 percent of the time, and a slow curve that he's thrown exactly once. His pitch profile is a hoot: Overwhelmingly Imanaga relies on a combination of the four-seamer and a deadly splitter, effective against righties and lefties, but then there are six whole other damn pitches—two more than Luis Castillo has in his entire repertoire—that Imanaga throws just here and there, evidently whenever he is feeling zany. This is how you know starting pitchers are artists, or mad scientists, or both.\nPaul Skenes, flame-throwing phenom and rookie ace of the Pittsburgh Pirates, has a changeup. I'm not totally sure I knew that. Skenes has thrown over 700 fastballs this season, but entering Tuesday's start against the Chicago Cubs he'd thrown the changeup just 60 times. Like Imanaga, Skenes has a combination of go-to pitches that, when it's working, tends to be overwhelming. His fastball is, of course, terrifying, and the dreaded splinker, an average of five miles per hour slower than the heater, is a diving, sliding, vanishing nightmare against which MLB hitters are slugging just .248. A changeup is a more complicated offering, something a lot of pitchers have to feel around for early in a start; Skenes can just rear back and hurl the splinker, and for good measure he's got his choice of three effective breaking pitches. The changeup is in Skenes's toolkit what a hand-cranked sausage maker has turned out, regrettably, to be in mine: A fun but clunky thing to play with, which might not be used more than a handful of times between now and 2050.",

They carry massive flags emblazoned with the prancing horse, and bring flares that douse the stands in red. Oh, you'll see similar scenes at the Dutch Grand Prix, and hear them at the British Grand Prix, but in Formula 1, only the tifosi are fully able to blur the line between nationalism and the rapturous worship of a team and its brand—or a brand and its team, depending on how you'd like to think about it. Meet a driver, and the first instinct is to clutch his hand and kiss it, like a king or a god. At the Italian Grand Prix, everyone is a Ferrari fan. Even if they say they're not, they are Ferrari fans.\nCharles Leclerc is the perfect vessel to carry all of it. Not quite homegrown, but tied to the team for any relevant span of his racing career. His debut year for Ferrari immediately cemented him as Ferrari's answer to Max Verstappen; his bright, mercurial brilliance was enough to supersede even Sebastian \"Ferrari's biggest fan\" Vettel, who had spent the two previous years fighting Lewis Hamilton honestly for a championship. Carlos Sainz Jr. is also racing for the team, but, biology aside, he doesn't bleed red the way Leclerc does. It was Leclerc who, in 2019, gave Ferrari its first home win in nearly a decade. And with Lewis Hamilton joining the team next year, 2024 is perhaps the last year where he and his little wiener dog will form the undisputed core of the team.",

The leaves are changing, the temperature is dropping, and we get our first sense of the contenders for one of the now 12 spots in the playoff. At the start of this season, some teams have shown surprising promise, like USC. Others have already made an emphatic statement, like Notre Dame and Miami. Some have started slow but are still in the fight, like defending champs Michigan. And then there's FSU.\nAfter unfairly (yes) getting left off of last year's playoff, Florida State spent the offseason not just losing all their stars to graduation and the draft, but also doing a whole lot of bellyaching and threat-making, much to the consternation of everyone else. The school's enemies and haters are surely delighting in seeing the Seminoles follow up all that bluster by blowing their first two games of the new season. Not only has FSU blown it, they've looked horrid all along the way. DJ Uiagalelei has somehow gotten worse after transferring over from Oregon State, the receivers are dropping passes, the defense is getting run all over by ACC \"powerhouses\" Georgia Tech and Boston College, and the play calling on both sides of the ball has been anemic.",

This July, directors the Kinnane Brothers released Water Brother, a feature documentary about Abbruzzi’s life.The film uses archival footage from 1969 to today to catalog Abbruzzi’s time as a rarified Newport local and owner of beloved surf shop, Water Brothers. The shop—a lighthouse to young skaters and surfers for the 50 years it was around—finally succumbed to destruction by developers in 2024, despite decades of pushback, hijinks, and punk vigor that had long kept the place alive. Water Brother, the documentary, tells it all.\n“We were just free spirits,” Abbruzzi said of the 50 years that he ran the shop, at one point building an unsanctioned skate ramp in the parking lot and signing the local skater kids up for the Boy Scouts just to get insurance coverage. “All we wanted to do was skate and surf. In the film, [Johnny Leys says], ‘He was the worst businessman I’ve ever met.’ And that’s true.” During the storied history of Abbruzzi’s shop in Rhode Island, Abbruzzi earned the nickname the “Giveaway Butcher” because he was so motivated to get kids into surfing and skating that he was constantly giving gear away. And anyone who skates or surfs knows that the gear is not cheap. “I never got into this to be a businessman, to become a Ron Jon surf shop, to be any of that stuff,” Abbruzzi said. “And I'm glad I never did. Just to keep my head above water has been good enough for me.”",

          "description": "There is an auditory component to the James Wood Experience. For one thing, Washington's 21-year-old phenom outfielder hits baseballs real hard. Every time a baseball is hit real hard, a loud noise is produced. I realize that the thing I am about to say is speculative, or even mystical, and possibly offensive to the very concept of science, but: There are certain baseball players who hit the ball louder even when they have not necessarily hit it faster or farther. Most of these players are themselves very large. Wood's bat makes a distinct, crisp, ringing thwack sound even on grounders and foul balls and liners the other way. The thwack elongates and deepens into a thwock when he really connects, sonorous and even pulpy, an upsetting noise that registers in an atavistic part of the human brain as a signal of terrible violence. A home run off the bat of Wood (or Shohei Ohtani, or Aaron Judge, or Giancarlo Stanton) has this more primal resonance; the information it conveys in a split second causes a spontaneous, involuntary yelping reaction.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09SDwWJMeas",
