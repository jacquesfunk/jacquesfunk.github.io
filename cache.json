Because they are cut in two by our ad break, it is easy enough to mentally divide them; because they all begin with Drew's signature skronking vocal overture, they all have a shape. But what does it mean, really, to say that something like half of a podcast is given over to soda-related discourse, and that the other component parts are about going to a Marlins game, the demi-crisis in WNBA officiating, and also a frank discussion about the frustration of duffing the preparation of a familiar recipe? You can put all that together and reach 100 percent of a podcast and 63 minutes, but also those things do not, on their face, fit together at all. I realize that. And yet:",

Not slow in the way that catchers are considered slow by default, or how some tall lanky guys seemingly can't get their legs moving, or even slow in the way that Kyle Schwarber is. Josh Naylor is third-percentile sprint speed slow. Josh Naylor is the 16th-slowest guy in baseball, and the third-slowest first baseman—he'll beat Triston Casas and Rowdy Tellez in a footrace, but if you put him against a fast shortstop like Trea Turner, he's never winning.\nBut if you're only counting stolen bases, it's a different story. Turner currently has 25 stolen bases this year, on pace for a very respectable 35-steal season. He has been caught stealing six times, for a roughly 80 percent success rate, which satisfies the heuristic—though it is only a heuristic—of the 70 percent breakeven point. Not shabby at all! Bobby Witt Jr. has 30 stolen bases on the season and has been caught stealing seven times, for a roughly 81 percent success rate. Again, that's about what you'd expect. Meanwhile, Naylor has 21 stolen bases on the season and has been caught stealing only twice, for an absurd 91 percent success rate. Those are Oneil Cruz numbers, with the caveat that Cruz has attempted to steal 15 more times than Naylor.",

          "description": "Tom Brady may be incredibly famous, obscenely successful, and (formerly?) outrageously handsome, but he has never been cool. This is a plain fact, one that Patriots fans like myself overlooked during his tenure there and one that Patriots haters loved to mock him for. Since his retirement, Brady has lost the magnetic appeal of his abilities with the ball in his hands, which has made stark his absent coolness. His commentary stint has been mediocre at best and awful at worst, and his unwavering but erroneous belief in his own charm is fully insufferable without the touchdowns and wins to mask it. In place of any kind of recognizably human personality, there is nothing but coach speak and corporate speak and brand consciousness, which makes it close to impossible for him to forge any kind of connection with an audience when he's not wearing pads. That hasn't stopped him from trying, which brings us to soccer.\nBuilt in Birmingham: Brady & The Blues is the latest attempt to humanize and propagandize Brady, and in a perverse way it succeeds at painting what feels like a true portrait of the former quarterback-turned-commentator-and-owner. This is not to say that the show succeeds in making Brady a compelling figure, or even a sympathetic one. Instead, the show—which is terrible for a variety of reasons, almost all Brady-related—proves what has been obvious for years: post-football Tom Brady is nothing but a platitude-spouting Robotron incapable of self-awareness.",

The city often plays host to the U.S. Open, which is run by USA Table Tennis and features a handful of pros competing side by side with hundreds of amateurs. American players who have been to previous U.S. Opens arrived at the Grand Smash already familiar with the little hells that a tournament in Vegas can produce: blast-furnace heat and slot machine-choked hotels on the way to a convention center floor, undergirded by concrete so slick that players pour out drinking water to wet their soles between points.",

That's how Mason Miller was able to begin his ninth-inning save on Wednesday night.\nThe Padres' big deadline add from not-Oakland was in the news for the wrong reason after Tuesday's game, when Diamondbacks DH Lourdes Gurriel Jr. tied the score in the eighth by making Miller's flameball the fastest pitch ever homered on (probably ever, but at least since they started keeping track of those things in 2008). San Diego recovered to win in extra innings, but it was hard to forget the fact that Miller's searing heat had been made to look so vincible.",

It was big, that's for certain, but this was not unusual for male fiddler crabs, which wield one enormous front claw, much larger than its counterpart. This is what gets the the female fiddlers going: a large claw that can wave back and forth quickly; the kind of claw that sends a message. These major claws can comprise more than 30 percent of a male's total body mass, which is a big burden on such a little crab. But if a female likes the size and motion of a male's claw, she may enter his burrow and let him fertilize her eggs.\nBut Wavy Dave's large claw, according to those who've seen it, kept growing larger. On the first day he scuttled into town, his claw was nearly two inches from base to tip. But the next time he came 'round these parts, his claw was even bigger. If you'd had gotten close enough to measure it, you'd find it had grown to a whopping 2.7 inches, making it the largest major claw on record for the species Afruca tangeri. You might think twice before crossing Wavy Dave.",

          "description": "It is perhaps unfair to the rest of humanity to slot Alan Dershowitz in as a specific type of guy. He fits into a number of variously rancid cohorts: Inner Circle Jeffrey Epstein Associates; Celebrity Attorneys (Derogatory); People With \"Harvard\" As Their Personality; People With \"Actually I Have Voted Democratic\" As Their Personality; Podcaster. But the category into which he fits the most cleanly is more abstruse, and has less to do with anything Dershowitz has done or the (many) scary monsters and super-creeps that he has represented, than the way that Dershowitz himself is, and the uniquely grating hazard he represents.\nSo while it is true that Alan Dershowitz is quite literally someone who got into a huffy argument with a pierogi vendor at a farmer's market on Martha's Vineyard, was escorted from the premises by police, and subsequently threatened a lawsuit, it is also and more significantly true that Alan Dershowitz is exactly the sort of person who would do all those things, to the point where my first reaction upon hearing this news was trying to remember whether this was the first time he'd done it. And while I can now confirm that this was Dershowitz's first pierogi-specific Martha's Vineyard contretemps—as I was writing this, there was a second—there have been enough other things like it that it was a reasonable enough thing to be confused about. Give or take going on TV whenever anyone asks and writing books with titles like The Price Of Principle: Why Integrity Is Worth The Consequences, Guilt By Association: The Challenge Of Proving Innocence In The Age Of #MeToo, and Palestinianism: The Newest Attack On Peace And Human Rights And Democracy, this is just how Dershowitz spends his time—getting into weird public disputes and treating himself to outlandish takings of umbrage re: his seemingly very unhappy experience on Martha's Vineyard, where he has vacationed for 50 years, and then threatening lawsuits and recording emergency episodes of his delightfully named podcast, The Dershow, about it.",

The Los Angeles Sparks’ No. 2 pick in 2024 last played in the WNBA over a year ago, when she tore her ACL in the first quarter of a game against the Sun. There's not really a convenient time for a torn ACL, but the timing of this one was rough: The injury happened just weeks before she was set to go to the Paris Olympics as a member of the U.S. 3x3 basketball team, an opportunity that once delighted her to the point of tears. It also cut short a promising rookie season in which she’d looked like she’d soon be among the best defensive players in the league. \nIn the final days of July, some thrilling news popped up on the Sparks' injury report: Brink was upgraded from “out” to “doubtful” before a road game against the Liberty. The next game, against the Aces, she was “in.” She returned to play this month to fill a Defensive Player of the Year-sized hole on a talented but incomplete Sparks roster. On the very outside of the playoff picture with a 13-15 record, Los Angeles has heated up but could very much use some help from their young franchise star.",

          "description": "There are more intricate ways to measure a pitcher's talent and effectiveness than the digits on a radar gun, but none quite so visceral. The Padres acquired Mason Miller from the California Athletics because of the fact that he strikes out an absurd number of hitters on his fastball/slider combo. That fastball, however, is thrilling just on its own terms, because Miller throws it an average of 101 miles per hour. When you see a pitcher with that kind of cannon, watching the radar readings becomes its own sort of sport: Can he top 102? Can he do it again? Since every fan has traveled in a car with a speedometer at some point in their life, that data is far more comprehensible than, say, inches of break. And when you see a number like \"104,\" there's not much more that needs to be said beyond \"Whoa.\"\nMiller's first outing at a Padre, last Friday, saw him start by allowing two hits but quickly clean them up with a K and a double play. Returning to the mound in the eighth inning on Tuesday against the Diamondbacks, with his team leading 5-3, his stuff was just as eye-popping. But the results were a little rockier. Miller got a line-out to right on his first pitch, and he used his slider four out of five pitches to get a strikeout on Ketel Marte. But then he struggled to tame his own strength as he walked Geraldo Perdomo on exclusively fastballs that went by in a blink. That brought Lourdes Gurriel Jr. to the plate, with the chance to tie the game.",

His plan is not working out. \nA report released yesterday by the investigative team at Open Secrets shows Butker’s fledgling political action committee, known as Upright, is having trouble getting any lift. The PAC’s recent filing with the Federal Election Commission oozed lots of malaise and showed little money. Through the end of June 2025, Butker’s PAC had taken in only $4,023 in contributions this year and had just $1,786.43 left in its coffers. And, according to Open Secrets, of the $7,400 Upright has spent, “none of it benefitted Republican political candidates, either through direct donations to candidate committees or via advertisements that boost Republicans or criticize Democrats.”",

The football thing is the only provably and relentlessly bankable thing in the entire play-for-play diaspora, so ESPN is handing a 10 percent equity stake over to the league in exchange for the NFL Network, the RedZone channel, and other NFL media assets.\nThe long-awaited deal that subsumed ESPN's journalistic integrity, re: the NFL, is done. Alarm bells about diminished independence and the damage to journalistic integrity are ringing quite loudly, but in a diminishing number of circles. And besides, the days when anyone in ESPN's executive class are expected to care about any of that are long gone. ESPN is the cymbal-playing windup toy in the NFL's media orchestra, and that's just how ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro likes it. This, to appropriate a quote from prototypical owner-without-a-team Hyman Roth, is the business they've chosen, and being bed-partners is simply the logical extension of the way it works now.",

Maybe you realize an athlete needs money. Maybe you learn some movie star was actually a big dork and heavily into comics. Or maybe you find out that Larry King had a corporate-desk ornament hologram of Larry King.\nKing, the longtime infomercial pitchman and cable news presence, died in 2021. His heirs are finally getting rid of all his crap. The Larry King Collection is now at Julien’s Auctions, and there’s a lot there. Before he flogged loans on TV, King hosted a live talk show on CNN for 25 years on a set that looked suspiciously like the one he’d later use to sell fish oil pills. Larry King Live landed big interviews on non-Omega 3 topics with celebrities, politicians, and other newsmakers. The Larry King Cardiac Foundation’s website now directs to the spam URL clockwork-game.com, but he also did some charity work. He had public speaking engagements. He went to thousands of Dodgers games. People gave him lots of stuff. There really is a ton of crap to get rid of.",

Enticed by the prospect of hole-digging, I investigated further. It was a brand new point-and-click adventure called The Drifter, with a bleak art style and promises of a grand conspiracy to unwind. I never buy stuff at full price on a whim, but I made an exception this once.\nThe game tells the story of Mick Carter, the titular Drifter, and his attempt to return to his hometown and pay his respects to his recently departed mother. Mick is also homeless, has made a ton of terrible decisions leading up to the point where we meet him, and has caught a pretty rotten streak of luck as well. His circumstances are such that his major problems are often interrupted by very minor ones, which are nonetheless just as obstructive. How do you face your sister after all these years away? Well, first you have to find someone or something that will let you charge your dead phone, because you can't face your sister if you can't learn her address because your phone is dead.

An incredible, historic moment!\nAllow me to set the scene: It's the bottom of the 10th inning, the ghost runner is stationed on second base, and into the box steps Rangers veteran Marcus Semien. On the mound to face him is Yankees reliever Jake Bird. The Yankees are in trouble, and not only because they had to give an important inning of work to someone recently acquired from the Colorado Rockies: Back on June 6, they were 16 games over .500 and had the second-best record in baseball, but they are presently foundering, beset by bullpen suckitude, horrendous defense, injuries to all the wrong dudes, and what is starting to look like more than a fair share of bad luck. They dropped six straight in mid-June and then another six straight in early July, and have lost 10 of 17 since the break, including a sweep over the weekend at the hands of the Miami Marlins.

One day you live in a world where no professional sportswriter has ever taken umbrage with a league for not responding to three requests for comment about a player suffering a minor injury, and then the next you have to make sense of Christine Brennan doing just that.

What great work will emerge from this pandemic?” It was a stupid question at the time, and five years on, a cursory survey of the cinematic output that deals in some way with COVID turns up very little of significance. The films range from the justly forgotten star-studded comedy The Bubble to the superb, though substantively unrelated, Zoom horror film Host. Mainly, filmmakers rely on shallow, obvious references to recognizable hallmarks: masks, social distancing, toilet paper hoarding, Fauci. This is inevitably shot through with a degree of gravity that, while understandable, treads a careful, deliberately inoffensive line. Perhaps it’s because those early years were also marked by massive political upheaval and what might be, politely, termed social breakdown that it’s so difficult to fully dramatize what was happening. \nPlus, no one wants to think about COVID anymore.",

During Saturday's qualifying session, Charles Leclerc even managed to steal pole position away from the McLarens (and, somehow, Aston Martins) by a margin of .026 seconds. \"Today I don't understand anything in Formula 1,\" Leclerc said, expressing his surprise by the pole during an \"extremely difficult\" qualifying.\nAs long as you stop there, the sentiment is optimistic rather than ominous. And if you memory hole every other moment of the weekend, you will forget Lewis Hamilton's Q2 exit—material evidence of Ferrari's \"extremely difficult\" qualifying—and his shockingly despondent media comments after the fact. Every all-time great is bound to have some decline in form, but even factoring in the margins from his teammate this year, Hamilton's comments felt extreme. \"I'm useless, absolutely useless,\" Hamilton said.

It wasn't, but this is what happens when your franchise has two World Series victories and seven other playoff games in 33 years. That third spot on the podium remains very much available.\nStill, you take your moments when you can, and this is the Miami Marlins' moment. The moment in question being when the Marlins swept the New York Yankees at home before 101,000-some-odd announced mammals over the weekend to get their once-dismal record to a deliciously mediocre .500, and in so doing moved within hailing distance of the final wild card spot. That last thing doesn't seem like much, and it probably isn't, but the Marlins' fan base has decided that the Yankees are their archrivals despite the fact that Yankees, who are in a different league, barely acknowledge that the Marlins even exist. Yankees fans weren't even sure the Marlins existed in 2003 when the Marlins beat the Yankees to win their last World Series.",

They put the ball in play. They find a way to create runs.\" It's all true: The Brewers have the best team batting average and on-base percentage in the National League; they don't do a lot of slugging but they swipe a lot of bases, and they will absolutely doink and small-ball your ass all the way to death. Per Statcast, the Brewers have the lowest barrel percentage and the third-lowest average exit velocity in all of baseball. These guys love to hit a baseball so softly that the bat makes a sound like the snapping of a stale breadstick and the ball flies into the outfield grass at velocities that would not earn a speeding ticket on any interstate highway in America.\nWho am I to judge? After all, it works: The Brewers today boast the best record in all of baseball. If their offense is broadly outperforming the quality of the balls they put in play—Statcast says their expected weighted on-base average on contact is fourth worst in the majors, and their team batted ball profile is remarkably unsexy—I am inclined to credit them with making some of their own luck. They're disciplined: They see a lot of pitches, and they don't chase, and because they're very zippy on the bases they put a lot of pressure on an opposing defense. For a team like the Nationals, one that runs out a bunch of sad-sack juiceless pitch-to-contact bozos and backs them with deeply lousy defense, the Brewers are basically a nightmare. Well-placed soft liners accumulate at what certainly feels like an exponential rate, overwhelming your very sorry and helpless baseball team the way flood debris conquers the pilings of a flimsy old bridge.",

We peer into them for work, insight, entertainment, communication, companionship, and we peer for so long that the outside world comes to seem like an addendum, an antechamber of the vision granted by the screen. “The internet has many potentials,” says the Japanese master filmmaker Kiyoshi Kurosawa, “and one of them is this ability to amplify what’s inside us.” Any desire, impulse, resentment, or prejudice: Like the characters in those myths of self-obsession told around the world, we gaze into our reflection, and disappear.\nIn his new film Cloud, those who touch this void become it, a game of annihilation where everyone loses. At the start, Yoshii (Masaki Suda) is hustling a small business owner for the last of his merchandise. The man has a sob story—he invented a medical device and went bankrupt—but Yoshii isn’t interested. He pays bottom dollar for the last of the inventory, and packs them into a rental truck.",

According to Gary Washburn of the Boston Globe, Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca has agreed to a deal with the Mohegan Tribe to purchase the Connecticut Sun, and he has aspirations to relocate the team. I bet you can guess where.\nPer Washburn's report, Pagliuca's offer is for $325 million, which would be $75 million more than the price for a WNBA expansion team these days. If approved, it would be the most expensive sale for a professional women's sports team. On top of that amount, Pagliuca would earmark $100 million for a new practice facility to be built in Boston. The Sun would have their games in TD Garden by 2027, even if that meant spending the early part of their season in Rhode Island to get around any playoff schedules for the Bruins or Celtics.",

          "description": "After the 2023 season, when the Mariners narrowly missed out on the playoffs despite having 90 percent odds of making it at the start of September, Jerry Dipoto traded Eugenio Suárez to the Arizona Diamondbacks in exchange for relief pitcher Carlos Vargas and White Sox legend Seby Zavala. The decision was, ostensibly, to trot out a lineup that struck out less often—Suarez's 214 strikeouts led the league. A fine explanation. Without it, the trade would have resembled a salary dump. Unrelatedly, this was also the offseason when Dipoto set his famous goal of winning 54 percent of games in a season.\nNever mind that strikeout rates aren't correlated with raw offensive production. They certainly don't look very nice, and why not build a team for aesthetics if you aren't going to build one to win? If cutting down on strikeouts was the goal, trading away Suárez didn't immediately do the trick. The Mariners' overall strikeout rate went from 25.9 percent in 2023, or second-worst in the league, to 26.8 percent in 2024, which tied for worst in the league. At least the Mariners have improved in 2025—their 23.0 percent is only ninth-worst in MLB.",

          "description": "Emmanuel Clase's paid leave has screwed up some plans. The news that the All-Star closer is involved in MLB’s sports betting investigation “did not simply deprive the Cleveland Guardians of their top trade chip,” The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal reports, but also “ended any chance of the Guardians becoming a buyer.” Officially in sell mode, and without the guy expected to net a haul in a hot reliever market, the team flipped ace Shane Bieber to the Blue Jays and Paul Sewald to the Detroit Tigers on Thursday, and reportedly shopped around Gold Glove outfielder Steven Kwan.\nGuardians execs were not the only ones with a lot staked on Clase. He’s one of seven baseball players who signed an agreement with the company Finlete, which allows fans to purchase shares in a player’s future earnings. The concept is a variation on the income-sharing agreements some young athletes sign to guard against career uncertainty, promising an investment firm a percentage of their future earnings in exchange for a cash advance. Big League Advance, now doing business as Big League Advantage, might be the best known of these firms: Fernando Tatis Jr. recently sued BLA, accusing them of using “exploitative, predatory business practices” when they signed him to one of these contracts at age 17. Overwhelmingly, the players signing income-sharing agreements are young Latin-American players, who are able to sign with MLB teams at a younger age and tend to receive lower signing bonuses than their drafted U.S.-born counterparts.",

Once, Vaughn was shooting a movie down the street from my job, but I never saw him. I’ve not met Limón, though I know other poets who know her.

Still the deed was there to be done, and the gods know Falvey and Preller tried in their own separate ways to make Thursday’s MLB trade deadline one of the most ludicrous redeployment festivals in the history of human arbitrage.

          "description": "I had an unusually hard time finding a feature photo to go atop this blog. Almost none of this is the fault of the couple of Getty photographers who hang around the Minnesota Twins. For one thing, I was on the hunt for an image of a player who is still on the team. But ahead of the Thursday trade deadline the Twins shipped out approximately 40 percent of their major-league roster, including nearly everyone of any present value, so the options were not great. For another—and I want to reiterate that I am not blaming anyone for this—photographers David Berding, Matt Krohn, Rob Tringali, and Brace Hemmelgarn show a strong preference for compositions featuring cool things happening and players being happy. I was looking for something that matched the vibes of what is left of the Minnesota Twins, but since I could find no recent images of Byron Buxton hitchhiking along I-35W, or of Joe Ryan staring at the horizon with tears streaking his face, I had to settle. That up there is the perma-crabbed Royce Lewis, looking ambiguously pensive; I am like 80 percent sure Lewis is still a Twin today, although he is never more than one misplaced banana peel away from a four-month stint on the injured list.\nThe Twins were not the only team that spent the past few days selling, but their version of selling was by far the most gruesome and dispiriting. They first entered the Deal Zone Monday, a rare early mover in a deadline that otherwise took a while to shake loose. Their swap of Chris Paddack and reliever Randy Dobnak to the Detroit Tigers for a surplus catching prospect down at the Florida Complex League signaled pretty definitively that the Twins would be parachuting out of the American League's wild card hunt. The fire sale did not shift into high gear, though, until Thursday, when some poor social media person spent the afternoon firing off \"Thank You\" posts to just about anyone on the roster that president of baseball operations Derek Falvey could exchange for a reasonably fresh ham sandwich.",

In your more speculative or spammy sectors, this is unsurprising; the people in charge of all that are not what you'd call nurturing, and get bored quickly. This feels and is bad, but it makes the few places where there is undeniable growth happening stand out that much more. In the case of the WNBA, which is growing fast and preparing to grow faster, it stands out doubly because so much of the discourse surrounding the league suggests that it is actually somehow in crisis.

The start time had been moved back 15 minutes, to 3:45 p.m., to accommodate an umpire’s schedule. But Ulfers shook it off; she was used to pitching under pressure and in less-than-ideal conditions—she’d been on the varsity team since the year before, as an eighth grader. (In Minneapolis, since most middle school sports were cut due to budget shortfalls in 2015, middle schoolers play on high school teams.) The game was tense, with the lead going back and forth, and by the end of the sixth inning, the score was tight: Southwest 15–Washburn 13. \nBut instead of getting another chance to bat and close out the game, Ulfers and all the other athletes were told to go home.",

Try the veal.\nYankees shortstop Anthony Volpe has a problem. No one involved wants to use the dreaded Y-word. Yips are for Chihuahuas! It's a \"defensive slump,\" according to his manager Aaron Boone. To Volpe, it's simply \"this,\" as in, \"I’ve never really experienced something like this.\" What this is is a newfound and inexplicable inability to throw a baseball where he wants it to go. Volpe has committed three errors in his last two games to push his season total to 16, the most of anyone in MLB.",

They are starving because the Israeli government is not allowing enough food to enter, and because what food becomes sporadically available can be claimed only by those willing to enter the death traps engineered by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an American and Israeli-backed private food distribution system. \nA recent report from the U.N.-affiliated Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, including data up to July 25, “indicates that famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of the Gaza Strip and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City.” Because this crisis is so widespread, it will necessarily impact wide swathes of the population. There will be Palestinian men, women, and children who struggle to meet their minimal requirements for nutrition. This will happen to elderly diabetics and pregnant women and asthmatic teenagers. The frail bodies of children with conditions that impede muscle development will become frailer. That hunger will come for those already struggling to thrive makes the situation more horrifying, not less, provided you are a person who has not systematically shriveled your own moral instincts down to nothing.",

Sometimes it's best for these things to simmer, though, and in this case the time away served everyone well. The 2025 WNBA season has had months to settle into itself, to surface compelling narratives and interesting players, and here at the start of the stretch run there is one story that matters more than all the others: There are two great teams in this league, and then there's everyone else.\nBefore Wednesday night, the New York Liberty and Minnesota Lynx hadn't seen each other since Game 5 of the 2024 Finals, which brought an entertaining and hard-fought series to a sloppy and somewhat disappointing end. They have since maintained their perches atop the league—the Liberty entered last night's game in Minneapolis with a 17–8 record and a net rating of 8.2, second-best in the league. The Lynx carried with them a 23–4 record and a sparkling 13.2 net rating. The anticipation for this rematch was somewhat diminished by the absence of Breanna Stewart, who is out of the Liberty's lineup while dealing with a bone bruise in her knee. But these teams are good enough and deep enough to turn any meeting between them into a spectacle, and that's exactly what they did throughout Minnesota's 100–93 victory.",

One specific detail about his physique sounded incredible, in the literal sense of the word.\nThe feature, co-written by Andrew Heffernan and Ebenezer Samuel, presents an inside look at how Doncic is getting lean and strong with his trainer in Croatia.

It is at least a moderate deal. We are not talking about the zippy little Space Mountain stuff that makes passengers giggle during approach. Passengers in this case were lifted from their seats and bounced around violently, and several people barfed all over the place. The flight had to make an unscheduled landing in Detroit, so unstable was the weather, and did not finally land in Minneapolis until around 1:00 a.m. Several Red Sox players were still feeling sick and beat up the following day, and reliever Garrett Whitlock had to miss the series opener due to lingering aftereffects. Two Red Sox players and one broadcaster called it the worst turbulence they'd ever experienced, per MassLive, and these are people who do a lot of flying.\n\"Forty-five minutes straight of left, right, dropping down,\" recalled Lucas Giolito, who compared the experience unfavorably to a roller coaster. \"Sitting on a plane, it was like, oh boy. At one point, I kind of flew up out of my seat. I was like, 'OK, it’s time to put the seatbelt on.'\" Giolito says he was comforted by the knowledge that \"commercial airline jets never crash from turbulence,\" information that he picked up from watching The Rehearsal, a show that I have never watched and that from my experience entirely defies explanation.",

For basically all of my life, whenever I've heard reference to Tolstoy—OK, mostly War And Peace specifically, but whatever—it's felt like he's been hanging high above my head, his essence incomprehensible to my less-developed brain. He's so revered and so synonymous with supersized, challenging literature that he felt, basically, like the final boss of reading. \nWhat surprised me about Anna Karenina, however, is that on a sentence level, it isn't tough at all. It was listed under \"YA\" at my library, sure, but I kind of thought that was some sort of trick to lure young people into giving a classic a shot. The language in my copy was so basic and so direct about what was happening that I actually looked up the translation to make sure I hadn't accidentally grabbed some sort of \"No Fear Shakespeare\" version of the novel. (Apparently, Louise and Aylmer Maude were pals of Leo's back in the day, so I trust that they were faithful.)",

He always did, because he could throw 80 mph as a 13-year-old, and he never missed the catcher's mitt. Games with Paul on the mound were easy; I'd just stand at my position at second or first base and watch the strikeouts accumulate while feeling sorry for the kids on the other team who had to quiver through each at-bat. Paul was the best player any of us had ever seen. During this game, though, a fastball got away from him and sailed directly into the cheekbone of the batter, Josh, a kid we all knew and were friends with. There was a sound like a mallet hitting meat, followed by the muffled ping of the bat hitting the ground just before Josh's body, and then the most upsetting scream I've ever heard.\nAn ambulance came for Josh (he ended up being fine, I'm not sure if he even broke a bone), and the game continued without him. Paul spent most of the delay crouched between home plate and the mound, his hat pulled down as far as it would go. Somehow he stayed in the game, and got through the next few innings while soft-tossing balls over the plate. Paul, who up until that point I could only perceive as a mythically good ballplayer, was scared. He didn't want to hurt anyone else.",
