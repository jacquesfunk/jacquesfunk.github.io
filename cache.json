It makes some sort of sense that Victoria’s Secret chose this song to frame the return of its fashion show, which is actually just a long ad that the company managed to turn into a weird cultural touchpoint for 20 years.\nChappell Roan is one of the biggest pop stars of the year, and her earworm singles are the perfect kind of good-vibes, girl-power music for corporate advertisements, as long as you don’t listen to the lyrics too closely. Previous versions of the show might have had an artist like her join the Angels on the runway, but there’s no way Chappell Roan would have appeared at this. “Femininomenon” is a queer awakening, and a reminder of what lies on the other side of living for the male gaze, male approval, and male mediocrity. The pre-chorus goes, “I don’t understand why can’t any man / Hit it like / Get it hot/ Make a bitch / It's a femme.” In the show, the word “bitch” was muted, which was jarring at first, but in a way also perfectly encapsulated the show's toothless attempt at corporate feminism in its bid to recapture the affections of young women across the country.",

It’s very much up in the air whether it will or even can be repaired for the 2025 season. As new stadiums usually need three years or so for construction (except for the A's, who have needed 19 and still don't have a hole in the ground), the Rays could be vagabonds through 2027, if not beyond.",

          "description": "Just two weeks after Helene barreled across Florida as a Category 4 hurricane and ripped through five other states, Category 3 Hurricane Milton delivered a devastating follow-up to the Sunshine State. Although Florida is more than familiar with extreme weather events, the back-to-back nature of such powerful storms has strapped the resources of a state that was still reeling from the aftermath of the impact of Hurricane Debby two months ago.\nHelene proved the deadlier of the two storms, carrying devastating flooding to western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee and killing more than 200 people. As of Oct. 15, 92 people are still missing in North Carolina. In Florida, Milton ended up sparing a direct hit on Tampa that would have caused catastrophic, lethal flooding damage. Instead, the storm made landfall 70 miles south in Siesta Key, and its aftermath has killed at least 14 people. Milton left more than 3.2 million homes and businesses in the state without power, some of which had been without power since Helene hit.",

          "description": "Nothing about Tom Brady's entrance into the Las Vegas Raiders' ownership group is funnier than the handwringing about how this new conflict might affect his broadcasting duties with Fox. That one’s simple—it won't. Being an owner means he’s forbidden from doing some of the basic stuff that broadcasters do, from being critical of officiating to attending to basic pre-production duties, but Brady’s booth work always seemed like a lucrative way to kill time until this thing came along. If it means that Fox is on the hook for $37.5 million a year of Brady half-arseing his way through Falcons-Broncos, well, Fox hired Brady to be Brady. Breaking down Bo Nix for the Sunday proles was surely never the hook for him. For one thing, the cash was too good for him not to do it. For two, the appeal of the gig was surely diminished by the fact that there’s no way to prove beyond a doubt that you’re the best at it when you're stuck musing about why Bo Nix isn't.\nBut there's more—much, much more. Brady is not going to rest on his freshly approved ownership percentage (five percent), not by any means. He is coming in to have, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal's Vincent Bonsignore, “a much bigger role than people think in the direction of the franchise in all areas on the football side.” That's according to the ubiquitous \"league source,\" which as we know could mean anything from Antonio Brown up to but not including Roger Goodell. It only makes sense that Brady isn't just making a passive investment here.",

On paper, things are just fine, even with the one loss. It's not like Bama never lost any games under Nick Saban. And yet, if you spend enough time in their corner of the internet, you'd think the sky is falling. After a big, tenure-defining win against Kirby Smart's Georgia, DeBoer's Tide blew it against Vanderbilt, the punching bag of the SEC. How bad was the loss? Beyond the fact that it was Vandy's first win against a top-five team in their history, there was the added bonus that it was a top-to-bottom beating in which the Tide never held a lead all game.\nIt was a bad loss for a program of Alabama's stature, made worse by the fact that it was followed up with another stinker in South Carolina. Alabama edged an unranked Gamecocks team by just two points, and looked vulnerable the whole game. In fact, the Tide have spent a lot of time looking vulnerable this year: They spent three quarters struggling against USF before finally pulling away late in the fourth, and even their big win against Georgia featured a heroic second-half comeback by the Bulldogs that turned what should have been a triumphant blowout into an escape.",

Columbus fans are used to their stars leaving: for more money, bigger cities, more competitive franchises. If Gaudreau shocked the rest of the world when he signed with the Blue Jackets, he didn't shock Columbusites—he merely became one of them. He embraced them, and they embraced him in return. He wanted to be there. He always will be, in memory, because memory lasts longer than a life.\nTuesday marked the home opener for the Blue Jackets, and the night belonged to Gaudreau. The team revealed a memorial to Gaudreau on the concourse, featuring his used equipment and signs left by fans after his death, which will be there all season. All players on the Blue Jackets and the visiting Panthers wore his No. 13 in warmups. A video package was played on the jumbotron honoring his life. His wife Meredith and their two young kids were invited onto the ice as Gaudreau's banner was raised to the rafters.",

Such are the momentum swings of the postseason, and such is the damage that sophomore third baseman Mark Vientos can do when he locks onto a ball from the batter's box.\nAfter a glum 9-0 loss on Sunday night, it was Mr. Smile himself, Francisco Lindor, who gave the Mets a pick-me-up with a lead-off dinger to right against Dodger opener Ryan Brasier. That longball not only punctured L.A.'s lengthy scoreless streak, it also helped set up the key moment of the ballgame as Landon Knack labored through the second inning. Scooping up a couple of outs while allowing a single, a walk, and an RBI double, Knack was set to face the 1-for-1 Lindor with men on second and third and the score already 2-0. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts directed his man toward the correct strategic decision, sending Lindor to first on an imaginary quartet of balls. But the choice to face the next man in the order over Lindor only steamed up the Mets' two-spot hitter, who's no slouch himself.",

          "description": "The Jets are a team that specializes in unfulfilled promise. The promise of the 2023 season was Aaron Rodgers's arrival, and was dashed the moment his Achilles tendon rolled up the back of his leg in the season opener. The start of this season brought even more promise: While Rodgers was out last year, the rest of the Jets' roster cohered into one of the league's more talent-rich outfits, and it wasn't hard to imagine a team that went 7-10 with Zach Wilson starting most of the games suddenly becoming a force after Rodgers reclaimed his position. A 2-3 start put a damper on things, but also opened the door for promises to be made. It was a coaching problem! With Robert Saleh shitcanned and Nathaniel Hackett stripped of his play-calling duties, the Jets would finally—finally!—be ready to transform into the great team their roster says they are supposed to be. Monday night's game against the Bills was a great opportunity for the Jets to finally start making good on some of those promises.\nDid we see a transformed and re-energized Jets team on Monday night? Well, the offense looked better than it had. Todd Downing's play-calling opened some running lanes for Breece Hall that were previously hard to come by, and Rodgers had his best game as a Jet, throwing for 294 yards and two touchdowns. But is a team that is about to turn the corner one that loses 23-20 to a sputtering division rival at home? Is a team that has ironed out its inefficiencies one that nets one touchdown from four red-zone drives, gets repeatedly run over by Ray Davis and Ty Johnson, misses two field goals, and commits 11 penalties? The Jets under Saleh were a team that dropped way too many passes, drew way too many flags, and routinely undid itself with mistakes of all varieties. Our first look at the post-Saleh Jets indicates that this is still a team that drops way too many passes, draws way too many flags, and knows just how to undo itself with stupid mistakes.",

Let us pretend, in this scenario, that you did not always switch back to the baseball game in time for the start of each inning, and sometimes missed a few pitches. Let us also imagine that at the start of the bottom of the third, you tuned in just in time to see Juan Soto crank a ball just over the wall in right-center. As he rounded the bases, you would naturally have turned your eyes to the score bug in the top-right of your screen. There, at first glance, and also second and third glances, you would notice the little bases graphic has second base a different color than the other two—lighter, filled in. You have been conditioned by a lifetime of score bugs to know what this means: There was a guy on second! Soto's was a two-run home run!\nBut no. It was a solo shot. The TBS graphic is just like that. It makes it look like there's always a runner a second.",

Sent to investigate the ice-covered and perhaps habitable second moon of Jupiter, it is qualified by NASA as a Large Strategic Science Mission, conveying with that designation its outsized cost, the peak technical capabilities of its instruments, and the importance of the science it expects to undertake. It is just the seventh planetary science mission to receive the LSSM designation, an elite group that includes landmark missions like Voyager probes and Mars rovers.\nThe spacecraft itself is massive: the largest NASA's ever built. Twenty feet tall, 72 feet wide when its panels are deployed—about the length of an 18-wheeler—more than 13,000 pounds, nearly half of that propellant, the rest the lightest-weight tech there is.

No one thinks of the Federal Emergency Management Agency except when their house has been reduced to a pile of debris and all the roads leading in and out of your city have been washed off the map. Or, for instance, when you see something on TikTok about the government corralling people in Florida and preventing them from evacuating ahead of catastrophic hurricanes. FEMA works almost exclusively in natural disasters, so there is a bleak logic to devoting pages on its website to fact-check a growing list of hurricane-related conspiracy theories.\n\"FEMA is not blockading people in Florida and preventing evacuations,\" one of the entries reads. \"FEMA does not control traffic flow or conduct traffic stops, which are handled by local authorities.

          "description": "BROOKLYN, N.Y. — I chuckled when I saw the words printed on the giveaway T-shirts at Finals Game 2 in New York on Sunday afternoon: “NOT DONE YET.” A kinder reading goes that all contenders think like this, no matter their situation. In the shadow of a Game 1 win, those words might have projected a noble kind of focus. We won’t rest on our regular-season laurels. Job’s not finished. Eyes on the prize. Giveaway shirt production lead times are probably not such that the Liberty ordered thousands of these to cope, anyway. But the shirts took on a slightly grimmer, funnier meaning in light of what actually happened in Game 1: an awful New York collapse. Now, methought the shirt doth protest too much. The “Our Season Is Definitely Not Over” T-shirt had people asking a lot of questions already answered by the shirt.\nIn a technical sense, it was true, though. The Liberty were not done yet. They still had a split to salvage in New York. And their home crowd, if volume was any sign, loved them no less for their choking. Fans might have felt a sense of déjà vu as the Liberty went up 17 points early, gutted through the second and third quarters, and then let the Lynx make it a one-possession game late in the fourth. But Breanna Stewart, she said afterward, was determined not to let “history repeat itself.” A determined Stewart is an awesome sight, and her arms made possible an alternate ending. Minnesota tried running back the small lineup that had worked for them in Game 1, but Stewart reminded them why it had always been a risky idea. She timed jumps like a defensive back to grab Minnesota lobs out of the air; she hung low to wreck entry passes and dribbles. After Courtney Williams skated past Jonquel Jones to make it a 68-66 game with 3:40 left to play, the Liberty ended the game on a 12-0 run. Stewart would finish with eight rebounds and a Finals-record seven steals, three of them in the fourth quarter.",

          "description": "The challenge of pitching is to stay unknowable—to keep hitters guessing, to never be timed up or figured out. By the end of the Tigers-Guardians American League Divisional Series, which featured a considerable number of relief innings even by the standards of postseason baseball, it did feel like these teams, who had met 13 times already in the regular season, were each becoming quite familiar with the other. The resulting sights could be something unfamiliar to fans: Detroit’s Beau Brieske, who hadn’t given up a home run off his fastball all season, serving up a go-ahead meatball to David Fry in Game 4; unhittable Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase allowing one less earned run in this series than he had all year. The threat of overexposure made each game feel extra tense. “It was such a fun series,” Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt said after Game 5 on Saturday, a 7-3 Guardians win. “Two very evenly matched teams going at it, and it was a lot of fun.” \nThough Cleveland’s path to the postseason wasn’t as bizarre as Detroit’s—the Guardians took first place in the division in mid-April and never relinquished it, despite scares from the Twins and Royals—they were both teams depending on run prevention. The Guardians offense cooled off in the second half, but the team stayed afloat thanks to an elite homegrown bullpen. An early-season injury to ace Shane Bieber, plus some underperformance from young arms, left the Guardians rotation in roughly the same [shrug emoji] shape as the Tigers’ heading into the postseason.",
