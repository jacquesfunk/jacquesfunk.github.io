It was the last thing they controlled the entire evening.\nThe team that rope-a-doped their way to almost incandescent glory in 2024 instead found out that, sometimes, you just can't slip the punch. It wasn't the third-time's-not-the-charm jinx that did them in, it was the Philadelphia Eagles. And more decisively, it was the Eagles with only some Saquon Barkley, an entirely different M.O. That meant the Chiefs weren't undone by a single player but a smothering collective impervious to even Patrick Mahomes's multileveled sorceries. The final score of 40-22 grossly flattered the Chiefs and barely explained Philadelphia's dominance. It's as if the \"GAME OVER\" legend at the end of Kendrick Lamar's halftime show had been frantically cobbled together after Zack Baun's second quarter interception.",

He would have bunny-hopped across an eight-lane highway for Bucks 135, Sixers 127 because for him—the last true basketball lifer—it wasn't the 135 or the 127 that moved him. It was the Bucks and Sixers part, and it would have been the same had he been given Pistons 112, Hornets 102, or Rockets 94, Raptors 87, or even anything involving the freshly re-deadified Wizards. Hubie was there unapologetically for The Game before him and only The Game before him. If you would have preferred Rockets-Raptors because it featured 81 points of better defense, you would have been wrong because every games was equal in his eyes— a chance to explain what was before him to people wanting to learn.\nHubie Brown is 91, and he looked and sounded every day of it 20 years ago when his coaching career ended. He coached somewhere for 30-some-odd years (even Wikipedia doesn't have firm dates for two of his high school jobs) and broadcasted somewhere for 29. He coached forever the same way, and he told the stories of the game the same way. He knew what he believed to be important, and walked and talked with that central precept for the entirety of his public life. He did it for so long and so unabashedly his way that he managed, somehow, to never fall out of fashion while anyone who came after him trying it Hubie's way was out of fashion immediately. The closest anyone came to doing Hubie was the much younger but no less self-assured JJ Redick, and he got in two years and change before he was hired to Hubie-up the Los Angeles Lakers.",

And if you can't be weird in Louisiana, well, what exactly is the point?\nWhen your biggest moment of the week, after all, is Roger Goodell leaning hard into an 18th game, you have a serious cultural dud on your hands. The football will be the football, of course, and as matchups go Eagles-Chiefs is not far from the best you can do. But New Orleans might be the last bastion of the pre-corporate days when the town created the atmosphere and it was up to the visitors to keep up. This time, the weirdest thing we got will be something we have to conjure in our own minds—the big game with a sitting President (Uncle Dismal) and a potential rival in 2028 (Stephen A. Smith). Neither is qualified to do the job, as one has proven and the other certainly would if given the chance, but the moment Smith's name appeared on a poll listing potential Democratic candidates and garnering 2 percent, we took an irrevocable turn toward a world in which Prince Andrew seems leaderly. All that is left for the rest of us is to find a country without an extradition treaty out of the way of the nuclear winds.",

In front of a season-record crowd at home, the No. 19 Lady Vols took down the No. 5 Huskies, 80-76, to end an 18-year rivalry drought.\nTo be fair, that timespan does include a 13-year gap in the series, which the late Pat Summitt called off in 2007 at the height of her feud with UConn head coach Geno Auriemma. He looks back on that heyday with little fondness. “It just became stupid and became something I didn't want to be a part of anymore,” Auriemma told reporters before Thursday’s game. “I think our fans are stupid. I think their fans are stupid, and how they reacted to the whole thing, it just became something other than a basketball game, and after a while that just got old.” (If he’s referring to the rivalry’s hostility, it should be noted that he had some hand in it, too.)",

It's not so much that publications across digital and traditional media are any less determined to degrade themselves in search of traffic, as it is that \"digital media\" and \"traffic\" are themselves largely bygone relics. I am almost nostalgic!\nBut only almost! That belly remains surfable, and plenty of news outlets are still determined to surf it. Perhaps as media literacy declines and as social media's utility as a news scraper craters, the public's thirst for knowledge—at least about one specific thing: what time the Super Bowl starts—can only be quenched by conducting a Google search. The funniest thing here is that the first result for any such search is a Google-generated box with the start time and the team logos, negating the primary utility of these sorts of posts.",

That's what you tell yourself! And then one February everyone goes crazy in the Deal Zone and there are one billion trades in one week, so many coming so rapidly that the league's preeminent scoopster isn't even waiting to learn both halves of trades before posting them and moving to the next one. Before you have time to fully wrap your head around one perplexing deal, 14 more have followed in its wake. All I wanted was a little action to pull me out of seasonal malaise, you sob, desperate to force the genie back into the bottle. Just like that, and too late, you remember that what you want from a basketball season, more than anything, is some by-God basketball. \nThey played some by-God basketball in Minneapolis Thursday night. The two participating teams were among the least active at the deadline. The Timberwolves, sitting sixth in the Western Conference standings with one of the most expensive active rosters in the NBA, were severely restricted by the current CBA and made zero moves. The visiting Houston Rockets kept their roster intact but acquired 32-year-old Cody Zeller to fill the very last seat on their bench, and otherwise picked up a few future second-round draft picks. The teams are good enough and young enough to justify standing pat, and to feel reasonably confident headed into the closing stretch of the regular season.",

Philadelphia finished the month 4-5, and New York, Washington, and Phoenix were all ahead of them in the standings.\nThat did not stop the crew at West Coast Video. With the team in fourth place in the division, the Philadelphia-based video rental chain pitched Eagles players on an idea—a rap song performed by the team, similar to the Chicago Bears' “Super Bowl Shuffle” three years earlier. Those Bears won the Super Bowl, and the song was nominated for an R&B Grammy, so it inspired a lot of imitators. Most were similar group raps by the team, but things did get weird around the margins. Bears coach Mike Ditka himself put out two different songs on VHS. The Cleveland Browns made a sci-fi short, D.T. in Dawg Territory, among other mini-movies.",

          "description": "For millennia, the western chimpanzees of Taï National Park in Ivory Coast have communicated with each other in a dialect of their own. They do not speak in words, but rather through gestures. In one gesture called leaf clip, a chimpanzee will take a leaf off a branch and rip it apart in their mouth, creating a ripping sound that might invite play. In another gesture called knuckle knock, males knock repeatedly on the trunk of a small tree; knuckle knock is an invitation meant to attract female chimpanzees, who may respond to the knocking gesture with a sexual display.\nScientists have observed the four populations of chimps in the Taï forest—the North, Northeast, East, and South groups—since the 1970s, learning about each of their particular customs. Knuckle knock was a staple in the North group for generations; before 2004, every male in the group used knuckle knock to woo females. But in the ensuing eight years, the population never had more than one adult male. This eliminated the need for a male to distinguish himself among competitors, and also prevented any younger male chimps from seeing the gesture in use and learning it for the future. In 2008, the last adult male chimp in the North group, and perhaps the last of his population to use knuckle knock, was killed by a poacher.",

Yes, we've gotten somewhere between plenty and more than enough of both these teams in the monitors over recent years; yes, some of this grumpiness is surely due to the fact that there were more novel and compelling options than these two very good but very familiar teams. I didn't write that I felt wrong in my churlishness, though. I felt, and still feel, faintly silly about it—about my inability to get especially excited about a game between these two extremely good and evenly matched teams, each of which dominated their respective conferences throughout the season and both of which make for pretty fascinating counterpoints to the other. I think the game will be good, but I can't quite feel what I probably should be feeling about it.",

The second was that the Western Conference playoffs are going to be incredible this year.\nThe majority of the eight teams in the bottom half of the playoff race made win-now trades ahead of Thursday afternoon's trade deadline. The talent scramble somehow gets fiercer the further you go down the standings; four of the five teams between eighth and 12th, at least two of which will not even make the play-in field, pushed their chips in. Why would this many ailing teams further over-leverage themselves for a chance to fight their way into the playoffs? I'd argue that this is proof that the play-in is working as intended and keeping more teams than ever before from tanking, but more to the point, the teams at the bottom of the race are battle-tested while the teams at the top are not. They're not just pushing for a playoff spot due to some clever incentives or because it's the right thing to do. They're doing it because they think they've got a shot at taking out one of the variously green teams currently atop the standings.",

Its name refers to Emancipation Day of Aug. 1, 1838, which is celebrated as a national holiday. On the way in, one can see a beautifully preserved mural of two 20th-century men who capture the ethos of Caribbean black liberation: Marcus Garvey and Haile Selassie. Selassie's legacy is more contentious—the Rastafari people who venerate the late Ethiopian emperor are not universally loved, even here—but there's little controversy about Garvey, whose likeness appears on the $20 coin.\nAt the time, I had no idea that Garvey would soon be pardoned by Joe Biden in one of his last acts as president, plastering Garvey's name in American headlines for the first time in decades. He was convicted on trumped-up mail fraud charges in 1923, a prosecution less about any crime than it was about Garvey's towering stature as an activist who founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association and advocated for black people's rights in the U.S., Jamaica, and around the world.",

The team was on pace to become one of the very worst teams ever; if you squinted into the police cruiser spotlight, as you no doubt have done at least once in the last year, they had an outside chance at being the very worst; if you watched them play, the case only became more convincing.\nBut because these are the Wizards, they couldn't even get the stink right. And because we want to be fair (this is a lie; we never want to be fair), we must now note that the Wiz are on a rare-for-them three-game winning streak during which they have lowered their margin of defeat to a terrible but not hideous 13.8 points per game, and now cannot finish with the worst record in NBA history. In fact, their 119-102 win over Brooklyn last night was their second most decisive victory of the season, a celebration of sorts after the already completely forgotten deal that sent Kyle Kuzma to Milwaukee for Khris Middleton, an athletic rookie, and a pick swap.",

Instead, it can be seen, sporadically, in the brown waters of the Amazon and other South American rivers occupied by the river dolphins also called botos. As the botos grow, their bodies blush a pale pink, a color that is particularly evident in males. When the male dolphins need to defecate, they do so without any fuss:emptying their bowels directly into the river. But when the males pee, they sometimes get a little fancy with it.\nIn such cases, a male boto will slowly roll onto his back, exposing his belly to the surface. Then, like a hoisted flag, his penis will gradually emerge from its usually sheathed position. And finally, the boto will begin to pee in one mighty stream that reaches as high as three feet in the air. The powerful arc of the boto's pee sails over his own head and eventually plummets into the water several feet beyond the tip of the dolphin's long snout, or rostrum. Once the boto has peed all its pee, he will slowly roll over once again and resume swimming. With a show like this, who wouldn't want a front-row seat?",

That one involved more teams, players, personalities, and wrecked preconceptions than the one that saw the Mavericks bail on their generational star. Which is why the gods in their infinite chicaneries came up with this four-torsoed, five-headed beauty that centers around the skull-melting notion of Jimmy Butler, Stephen Curry, and Draymond Green as teammates for what might be their last serious run at incandescence.\nThe Doncic-Anthony Davis deal, which nobody saw coming on Saturday and still inspires conspiracy theories about who screwed whom and for what reasons this long after the deal, has the advantage both of happening first and involving the Los Angeles Lakers. But before there was Luka—before anyone other than Miriam Adelson even imagined that there could be a deal involving Luka—there was Jimmy. Good lord,  was there Jimmy. There was Jimmy staging a month-long one-man palace revolt that he surely could not win against septuagenarian strongman Pat Riley, which played out through a series of suspensions and recriminations long past the point of caring. But credit where due: Butler’s monomaniacal persistence in the face of the oddest NBA trade deadline in memory finally got him both the escape route and the raise that he wanted, even if the team he went to is actually further behind in the standings than the one he left.",

The Trump administration is now threatening to pull federal funding from schools that protect the rights of trans people. The administration's interpretation of Title IX will certainly be challenged in court, and it's not clear how the administration plans to identify schools that are running afoul of this executive order.",
