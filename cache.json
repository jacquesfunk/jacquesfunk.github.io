          "description": "Let's start with a flaw. Liverpool's defense is still the best in the Premier League, having allowed 13 goals in 15 matches entering Sunday's trip to North London for a match against often-feisty but currently-shambolic Tottenham Hotspur. Virgil van Dijk is back to world-beating form, and his various partners in the center—often Ibrahima Konaté, though not for the past two months, thanks to a knee injury—have been competent enough to lead the league in goals against. However, there have been some cracks showing, and Liverpool's two previous league matches saw that dominant defense give up five combined goals to Newcastle and Fulham.\nBoth of those matches ended in draws, only the third and fourth blemishes in Liverpool's league season so far, and though it is unfair to put the entirety of the blame on the defense, it certainly didn't help. And so, if one were to look at just how many goals Liverpool gave up on Sunday against Tottenham, it would read like another bad day at the office for van Dijk and co. Thankfully, soccer is played in both directions, and Tottenham's three goals on its home ground only felt like feeble attempts at holding off the siege that was Liverpool's high-line-abusing attack, which scored six goals but probably could have scored 10.",

          "description": "Tyson Fury once broke an opponent’s spirit with a story. He was set to fight Wladimir Klitschko, who’d been in possession of at least one major heavyweight belt for a full decade, looking near invincible throughout his run. Few expected Fury to do much before getting knocked out. Then, in a sit-down face-off, Fury recounted a tale of a long-ago training camp in which he outlasted Klitschko in a sauna, making it out to be a battle of wills. Just before Fury revealed that Klitschko departed the hot box first, Wlad gulped like somebody was holding him at gunpoint. Fury was equally effective in the ring, so bamboozling Klitschko with feints and twitches that the longtime champion seemingly forgot to throw punches. Fury won, then rubbed a tub of salt into the wound by serenading his wife with a harrowing version of Aerosmith’s “I Don’t Want To Miss a Thing.” Klitschko stood feet away, perhaps daydreaming of new career paths and better singers.\nFury figured never to meet an opponent he couldn’t out-talk. He approached the brash knockout artist Deontay Wilder with a furious torrent of psychological warfare, then knocked him out twice in their trilogy. He surely has said the word “dosser” more than any other boxer, or Earth resident. He could be at turns nasty, earnest, bigoted, kind, or silent, but he inevitably snuck into his foes’ heads and mangled their brains before he even started punching them.",

City has shat the bed so regularly, keeping just one clean sheet over this stretch of misery, that it's risky to read too much into what otherwise might appear to be a statement win against the Citizens. For proof of this notion, look no further than Tottenham.\nWith that in mind, when you look at the scoresheet from that 2-1 Villa win and see Jhon Durán's name there, you may be tempted to discount what the goal says about the forward's talent. This would be a mistake, because Durán is scoring all the time, against everyone.",

There's way more money in being the guest of honor and the DJ simultaneously, even if the self-promotional moves are now boilerplate behavior for those who have to pimp their own ride.\nWhich is why, in the end, Rickey Henderson, who died Friday at 65 years old, was not merely arrogant and justifiably so, but the next step beyond merely arrogant. He had the gift, but he also knew that he didn't need to sell himself except to himself, because (a) he was his own best audience, as great performers tend to be, and (b) he figured that eventually everyone else would have to see it his way. And in this case, he was right.",

He's perfectly cast for a man who thinks Lawrence Welk is the cutting edge.\nThus, it was right and proper that he be the one to return the fair catch kick to our notice by stealing a last-second three-banger right before halftime of last night's Amazonapalooza in which Harbaugh's Los Angeles Chargers defeated the almost as old but not nearly so physically arresting Sean Payton and the Denver Broncos. An arcane enclave of the rulebook which was successfully employed as recently as 1976, when Harbaugh was spiritually already in his mid-40s, the fair catch kick can be employed only on a fair catch as time expires, or a penalty on a fair catch, which the Broncos' Tremon Smith gifted the Chargers on a punt that Derius Davis tried to collect with no time left on the clock. The 15-yard penalty took the ball from the Charger 38 to the Bronco 47 and offered an untimed play to provide the punishment for the penalty that would otherwise go unpunished—why, you could hear the oldey-timey gears in a million old coaches' heads at the possibilities. “It’s my favorite rule in football,” Harbaugh said.",

          "description": "Babygirl, a movie written and directed by Dutch filmmaker Halina Reijn and starring Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson, is about facades. It's also about sex, but less about sex itself and more about what sex says about a person, and the ways we suppress our sexual appetites in order for it to say nothing about us at all. Babygirl, Reijn's second English-language film after 2022's Bodies Bodies Bodies, taps into a conservative cultural moment that is firmly anti-sex while still being in sex's thrall. It is the subject everyone wants to talk about but no one wants to see, or seemingly even have.\nThe movie follows tech CEO Romy Mathis (Kidman), an unabashed, all-caps GIRLBOSS who nominally \"has it all\": a powerful job, a big office, an eager assistant who looks up to her, a seemingly well-adjusted family that includes two daughters and a hot theater director for a husband (Antonio Banderas). But there is a restless beast inside of Romy, and vanilla sex with her husband can't appease it—so much so that Romy often finds herself having to watch dom-play porn in the bathroom afterwards in order to actually reach an orgasm. When a much younger intern for the company arrives, Samuel (Dickinson), she slowly finds herself ensnared in his web, and discovers that he is up for taming that beast. Both in spite and because of the power dynamics and the threat their affair poses to her life and career, they begin an ill-advised relationship that is hot and steamy, but most importantly effective and passionate. Romy finds her sexual needs met for the first time, which, in this movie, is as important as the tension or thriller aspects at play.",

But has a new blobby fish emerged to unseat this age-old champion of blobdom?\nToday, a group of researchers from the nonprofit Conservation International published a report of 27 new species discovered in Alto Mayo, a region in the Peruvian Amazon. Each of the species was a singular delight: the amphibious mouse that dwells in palm swamps called aguajales; the small, stubby chestnut-colored salamander that climbs trees. But as I scrolled through the report, one species was a clear standout—a born star, never readier to accept its place in the spotlight. This, of course, was the blob-headed fish.",

If implemented into policy—which, admittedly, seems unlikely given the fact that Donald Trump is expected to fire the current NLRB general legal counsel—the filing could not only give more on-set protection to participants of shows like Love Is Blind but potentially allow them to unionize. \nSince its oddly prescient premiere in February 2020, which saw 15 men and 15 women dating, falling in love and eventually getting engaged sight unseen, Love Is Blind has faced allegations of mistreatment and coercion. Early contestants have accused producers of plying them with alcohol while regularly denying them food and water; one contestant alleged that production pushed her to continue filming even after she told them that she was experiencing suicidal ideation and wanted to leave. Over the past four years and seven seasons, the two production companies behind Love Is Blind—Kinetic Content and Delirium TV—have faced multiple lawsuits from former contestants. One of them alleges “inhumane working conditions” while another accuses Kinetic and Delirium of negligence, false imprisonment and sexual assault.",

This is why I have made it my business to reach as many members of the normal-person community with the Good News about the disgraced and deliriously scammy founder and figurehead of Ozy Media, who was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison for various oafish and common financial crimes earlier this week. I understand that my personal grievances with, say, Vice Media founder Shane Smith are my own, and my own problem; I understand, too, that there is no reason for really anyone to know who Jim Spanfeller is, although I have not always honored that. I get all this.\nBut it is my belief that Watson's baroquely thirsty and fraudulent public arc, while powered by the specific scamminess and scuzz of online media during the previous decade, is wild and weird enough to resonate even with people lucky enough to have avoided working in that field during that time. We put that to the test this week by having our buddy and former GMG executive editor Susie Banikarim on to talk about her new podcast about Watson's rise and fall.",

          "description": "It is a beloved media tradition: when a dysfunctional team's dysfunctional season reaches its dysfunctional end, reporters covering that team are permitted to write one big notebook-dumping explainer/eulogy. With a few outré exceptions, no one cares enough about bad teams to justify two such stories; with a few outré exceptions, no team is quite dysfunctional enough to fill out more than one. If you are a Tennessee Titans fan, to take one example, this is more or less the one big thing you have left to look forward to this season. You already know the team is lousy, inert, soggy and sodden and miserable; in a few weeks, once everyone goes home, you will find out whether that has anything to do with Tony Pollard's insistence upon letting his pet puma wander around the locker room or some such thing. That is how it usually works.\nBut the New York Jets are different. Everyone always and already knows about the pumas wandering around the locker room. Every week their ulcerous and increasingly haggard quarterback joins Pat McAfee's ESPN show via Zoom, seemingly from the Black Lodge, and starts Speaking Real Words about the germ theory of disease or whatever else is troubling him; this week, Aaron Rodgers testily demanded that critics of his (terrible!) recent play disclose their vaccination status, either as an indication of their bias or just as proof that they lack the courage that permitted Rodgers to self-immunize against infectious disease, possibly by eating hundreds of small, smooth rocks. This is just how the Jets are, and more or less how they have been since the pharmaceutical heir Woody Johnson bought the team 25 years ago. That they have the longest streak in American pro sports without a playoff appearance is not surprising given all that, but also feels somehow incidental to the organization's broader project, which under Johnson's blithely buttheaded stewardship has mostly been to generate news about people getting fired.",

          "description": "In the news that everything was thinking about, Mercedes announced Thursday morning that Valtteri Bottas would be returning to the team as its reserve driver. Bottas spent the past three years as an unfortunate, i.e. racing for Alfa Romeo–turned–Kick Sauber, but up until 2021, Bottas had represented everything a championship-winning team needed in a second driver: fast enough to ensure 1-2 finishes, good enough in qualifying to occasionally beat Lewis Hamilton, not quite good enough to disrupt a clear 1-2 hierarchy. The full circle continues what has been considered one of the kinder arcs for a second driver post-eviction: freed from the pressure of one-year contracts and matching up against literally Lewis Hamilton, Bottas grew a mullet and a mustache, posted ass, and then managed to return to Mercedes with zero expectations.\nIf Sergio Pérez has half that, he will be fortunate. Red Bull announced yesterday that Pérez would be leaving the team after three seasons. Pérez is already missing out on the clean end-of-term-into-multi-year-contract-with-another-team sequence that Bottas got. Lest anyone forgets, Pérez's contract was initially due to expire at the end of the 2024 season, but six months ago, Red Bull Racing announced that they had extended his contract by two years. This was a baffling decision at face value, but could be explained by the disaster of Red Bull leadership, McLaren evading consideration as legitimate Constructors' Championship contender, Daniel Ricciardo still being in the second VCARB seat, and Pérez having a far worse second half of the season compared to his first—he had four podiums prior to the extension, and zero after. In the end, Red Bull had to worm its way out of an easily avoidable extension, and took a no doubt expensive route to an inevitable result; Sergio Pérez lasted for longer than expected, but he, too, fell victim to the curse of the second Red Bull seat.",

          "description": "It was an eventful year for our award's namesake. Shams Charania's mentor-turned-rival Adrian Wojnarowski left ESPN in September to take a job in college basketball. Just three weeks later, Charania left The Athletic and assumed Woj's place as \"Senior NBA Insider.\" This was perhaps always his destiny, since he was a news-breaking teenage prodigy: to speak his beautiful sentences on linear TV, to appear in a little photo inset for news graphics. In November, Charania was granted an award for basketball writing besides ours: first place in the Professional Basketball Writers Association's 2024 Blumenthal Memorial Writing Contest, for his co-bylined work with The Athletic's Jon Krawczynski. If any of the other awardees are reading this post, please reach out: We're curious to know what it's like to learn that you have won an award for good writing, and then, within the same sentence, learn that Shams Charania has also won it.\nIt is momentous to present the Shamsy in this strange year of \"artificial intelligence.\" Sometimes critics compare the scoopster prose style to the output of a large language model; I find this funny, but off the mark. While often factually wrong and semantically hollow, an LLM's sentences typically scan like sentences that real humans might produce. Perhaps lazy or thoughtless humans trying to cheat on their homework, but real ones. These models are, after all, trained on a huge corpus of human writing. But the compositions of Shamsy award winners are compelling precisely because they deviate from default human rhythms. Man has not yet devised an intelligence that can report a Jarred Vanderbilt injury in such a disorienting fashion. For now, the human mind is more flavorfully stupid than its technological successors. That's what makes these nominees some of the most innovative writers working today, and that's why we're grateful to sift through these submissions.",

          "description": "Taco Bell's Crispy Chicken Nuggets feature white-meat chicken bites marinated in jalapeno buttermilk,\" breaded with a mix of breadcrumbs and tortilla chips, and then deep-fried.\n\nA 10-piece order included two dipping sauces and cost me $7.49. I went with the new Bell Sauce and Hidden Valley Fire Ranch.\nThere was quite a bit of variance in the size of the nuggets. The smallest piece was about half the size of the largest piece:\n\n\n\nThe breading was fairly thick with an almost knobby texture to it. I could see bits of tortilla chips sporadically embedded in it and some odd dark patches on the surface. It was lightly crispy but super crunchy when a piece of chip was encountered. The chicken inside was moist and decently tender. There was a lightly seasoned flavor to the nuggets and just a hint of spicy heat. Quality-wise, it's about the same level as frozen breaded chicken bites heated in the air fryer.\n\n\n\nThe new Bell Sauce offered a sweet tomato flavor and a distinct pepper note to go with a fair amount of spices, a mild heat, and a creamy, tangy mayo base.\nThe Hidden Valley Fire Ranch is a mixture of Hidden Valley Ranch and Fire Sauce. It was more run-of-the-mill versus the Bell Sauce. It offered the creamier buttermilk tang and herbiness of Hidden Valley ranch with an additional hit of tang and a moderate heat from Taco Bell's Fire Sauce.\n\n\n\nI found both sauces enjoyable but preferred the Bell Sauce as it was more complex and interesting.\nAt the end of the day, Taco Bell's Crispy Chicken Nuggets made for a decent but middling fast-food chicken nugget offering but with some added novelty from the new sauces.\nNutritional Info - Taco Bell Crispy Chicken Nuggets (10 pieces)\nCalories - 670\nFat - 33g (Saturated Fat - 3.5g)\nSodium - 1840mg\nCarbs - 20g (Sugar - 0g)\nProtein - 72g\nRead more at Brand Eating!",
