AEW—once an avatar of hope and change—took a creative and cultural nosedive. The Japanese scene is economically hamstrung and can't keep its top talents from moving to the States. It all combined for perhaps the worst non-COVID year for a wrestling fan since the widespread adoption of internet streaming. I look around and I crave a spark—an inspiring rivalry like Kobashi-Misawa, Punk-Joe, or Omega-Okada that lights a better path forward.\nWith that pessimism in mind, I picked 10 matches from 10 promotions this year, instead of the 15 I struggled to narrow down in 2022 and 2023. But I liked them, and I think you should check them out, because I got out of them what I still get out of great wrestling: excitement, astonishment, joy. Here they are, in chronological order:",

          "description": "I stopped drinking alcohol in June 2023, a decision that was long overdue and has since improved my life unconditionally—congratulations to me! And yet stopping drinking did in no way quench my urge to drink, because that's not how addiction works. In fact, I felt thirstier than ever and fiending for something to glug at a bar or a house party and pretend I was still a younger, more foolish version of myself. So I turned to mocktails, because that's what was increasingly advertised on the menus and on the subways and in a slew of articles and books. People were paying $14 for a Phony Negroni® at the shadowy pizza place down the street, so why shouldn't I?\nMy first foray in mocktails happened in 2016, during a six-month dry spell when I was on a course of the acne drug Accutane. The dive bars I went to with friends didn't yet have a trendy fleet of non-alcoholic drinks, and I was mostly too scared to make a bartender feel put upon by asking for an off-the-menu mocktail. (I did try this once in an attempt to flirt with the bartender and promptly received a Shirley Temple, which I didn't not enjoy but also made me feel like a child with no game.) Sodas were a no-go because of the caffeine, and plain seltzer made me wonder if bubbles were worth paying up to $3 for water. After some trial and error, I settled on a DIY mocktail I called spicy drink: I'd order seltzer with pineapple juice and douse it with hot sauce that I carried in my bag. The resulting concoction was sweet and sizzly, vaguely reminiscent of some of my favorite tequila drinks, although I would never serve it to anyone else. I made it work with spicy drink because I knew in a few months I'd be back in the saddle, reunited with my beloved tequila soda.",

          "description": "When Greg Gumbel was named host of the CBS NFL pregame show in 1990, he was viewed as a departure for the network. Brent Musberger had been host of The NFL Today for the past 15 years, and a lot of people were tired of his shtick. He dominated the show, and much of the network's sports coverage. Reporters wondered whether Gumbel, who had previously called NFL games and hosted NCAA men’s basketball tournament coverage for CBS, would be another preempting pregame personality.\nHe wasn’t, instead guiding the show in a lower key. Gumbel hosted in the studio with Terry Bradshaw, while Lesley Visser and Pat O’Brien handled features. The new host wanted to be the conductor, not the star. “If Terry stars on that show,” Gumbel told the AP right before starting, “then I’ll have done my job.”",

He said he changed beforehand, putting on a blazer over a button-front shirt. He changed his shoes, too. Crucially, he didn’t change out of the jeans he was wearing.\nCarlsen told the Chess YouTube show Take Take Take that he was in a rush to make it to the tournament. He got there in time, but his pants got him into trouble: Jeans are not allowed, per the International Chess Federation's dress code.

There is plenty of evidence to suggest that it may also have been the last meaningful basketball game they play in the years to come.\nAs franchise-breaking losses go, this one was at least a bang, not a whimper. The Kings hosted a hot Pistons team in the midst of an undefeated West Coast road trip, and despite their lone functional big man Domantas Sabonis missing the game with an illness, they built a double-digit lead early in the second quarter and steadily managed it for two quarters. This is what theoretically superior teams do at home against theoretically inferior ones, a dynamic which De'Aaron Fox's poor first half underscored. Down 10 with 3:36 left, Detroit began to mount a fierce resistance, which was enough for the Kings to totally clam up and stop playing anything resembling team basketball.",

          "description": "When F.C. Barcelona acquired Dani Olmo from RB Leipzig back in August, it did so despite clearly not being anywhere close to able to afford Olmo's salary under La Liga's Financial Fair Play rules, which regulate each club's spending relative to its earnings and debts each season, and which Barcelona has been wrestling with for years as a result of years upon years of hideous mismanagement. Olmo wound up missing Barça's first couple of 2024 La Liga matches because the club couldn't register his salary with the league.\nGood—or anyway, \"good\"—fortune came in the form of an Achilles tendon injury to trusty center back Andreas Christensen: In the event of an injury that will keep a given player out for four months or longer, La Liga rules permit a team to spend (and register) up to 80 percent of that player's salary for the purpose of filling the hole in the squad. With Christensen out, Barça got the space it needed to register Olmo, plus young attacker Pau Víctor—but only through the end of December. The club would have until then to benefit from Olmo's and Víctor's services; if by then it hadn't drummed up the additional income or savings it would need in order to extend their registrations through the end of the season, the registrations would expire on Jan. 1, rendering the two players unable to participate in La Liga matches and giving the club until the end of the January transfer window to get them re-registered.",

          "description": "By the time Bram Stoker died in 1912, Dracula remained his most successful and lucrative creation, a crude way of looking at a writer’s corpus but, in this case, informative of what financial circumstances his widow, Florence, was left in and how the property of Dracula was handled. As executor of Stoker’s estate, Florence had sole authorization over Dracula’s usage in any medium, whether stage plays or nascent motion pictures. In 1921, F. W. Murnau and Prana Films, cofounded by producer Albin Grau, had completed a complicated shoot of a German film titled Nosferatu (the production could only utilize one camera, which meant there was only a single negative to work with), a dramatically stark reinterpretation of Dracula released to little fanfare.\nNeither Murnau nor Prana sought permission to use elements from Stoker’s most famous novel from Florence, a concern made less straightforward by the regional differences in copyright law but one that Stoker’s widow nonetheless viewed as flagrant plagiarism. Florence, along with the British Society of Authors, soon launched a legal campaign to sue Prana Films for damages. Ultimately, Prana filed for bankruptcy and, in lieu of being able to pay restitution to Florence, relinquished Nosferatu’s rights and all copies of the film to the Stoker estate. The fiasco took about three years and by 1925, Nosferatu’s market value had fallen so steeply that Florence set about trying to destroy as many existing prints of the film as possible. Five years later, Universal bought the rights to Dracula from Florence and reportedly also bought an existing American print of Nosferatu that they then studied for the 1931 adaptation of the novel starring Bela Lugosi. Of course, extant copies of Nosferatu survived in other countries, prominently in France and the U.S., these and other copies shown in revivals and eventually restored throughout the years.",

For most of my life, I wore garbage sweaters that barely kept me warm. I’m sure you know this experience, too. The affordable, accessible options are generally so terrible that it’s possible that the majority of sweaters many of us have worn in our lives have been acrylic or some other synthetic material.
