Mine was that anybody who had their shit together enough to anticipate Thompson's walking route to an early-morning shareholders meeting, to calmly gun the executive down in front of onlookers, and to make a clean escape from the scene before anyone could apprehend or recognize or even follow him, would also have their shit together enough to have pre-booked a quick and frictionless exit from the United States, taking advantage of New York City's numerous, uh, points of egress or whatever. Assuming a tight schedule and reasonable but not desperate haste, I thought the assassin could fairly straightforwardly chuck the gun and (reported) fake ID and board an international flight out of the city under his own real name within a couple hours of the shooting. In that case he'd be gone long before the police had anything more to search for than \"a person, possibly blurry, possibly wearing a coat.\" I am not too ashamed to admit that I kind of hoped for this: Then we would never have to go through the exhausting and familiar ritual of trying to unpack the killer's politics.\nAs for the NYPD, the nation's largest and most extravagantly funded police force apparently had its own theory. Namely, that the masked assassin, having gunned down a public figure in the middle of a city of millions, at the nexus of innumerable flight networks, rail lines, and highways, was now crouching under or possibly directly behind a bush adjacent to a walking path in Central Park, perhaps while chanting \"I am the assassin.\"",

That feeling is based in some reality: Kansas City is 10-0 in one-score games this season, and many of those have been nationally broadcast affairs. But it might be useful to create a distinction between closing and underachieving.\nEven if there is a requisite amount of luck to these razor-thin wins, the Chiefs are talented, well-coached, and deeply familiar with crunch time. Mostly, they excel at error-free football when it matters, and they are good on pouncing on opponents' mistakes. These are the back-to-back Super Bowl champions, after all. So why does a team of this caliber need a field goal at the gun to beat the lowly Carolina Panthers, as they did a couple of weeks ago?",

He also deserves this spotlight, for being insanely cool and charismatic, and also young enough to be the face of baseball for a length of time that will take many of the bloggers for this website into eligibility for full membership in AARP. This is a real planting-an-oak-seedling type of deal for Mets owner Steve Cohen, who is 68 years old: There's a very solid chance Cohen will be dead before Soto collects the final paycheck of this contract, which will arrive sometime in 2039. The deal does more than increase the chances of Cohen owning a world champion: It changes the meaning of the word \"Mets.\" The Mets have been made.\nSoto played the first four years of his career for a cheapskate middle-class baseball team, and then was dealt to a nouveau riche big-spending club. He spent last season playing for a true blue-blood, and now, like boats and private planes and beachfront property, he is finally relegated to the very most exclusive asset class, permanently out of reach for fans of teams whose owners refuse to spend the market rate for top players. It doesn't much matter what happens next: If the Mets bomb and Soto becomes expendable a third of the way into this deal, he will never ever ever play for the cheapies. Even if the Mets decided that some package of young hotshot prospects was worth a swap, they could not ever convince, say, the Lerners to pay Soto's salary.",

          "description": "There were a number of factors that went some way toward explaining the record-setting $700 million contract that Shohei Ohtani signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers last winter. There's the inescapably abstract fact of Ohtani, a player whose only adequate scouting comparison has always been literally Babe Ruth and who as a result has always seemed more like an unusually good-natured demigod than he was like even the most elite of his peers. And there is also the contract itself, the deferral-laden format of which was either clever or cynical depending upon your perspective, but which was undeniably and utterly unlike any other free-agent contract. The deferrals in the deal were not new—the Dodgers have been pioneers in this space; they had signed Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman to deals with significant deferred money before that, and signed Blake Snell to another just last week. But the extent to which Ohtani's money was deferred was unprecedented and, again, worked to mystify the deal in ways that went beyond those inherent to the sunny-sided godhead that signed the dotted line. The deal was awe-inspiring in all the ways you'd expect a record deal to be, but it was also complicated.\nThis is all worth mentioning here, in a story about the record-setting free-agent contract that Juan Soto and the New York Mets announced on Sunday night, because Soto's deal is so uncomplicated by comparison. There were some extenuating circumstances here, too—Soto's young age and broad-ranging excellence, the presence of New York's two rich and self-conscious franchises as the 26-year-old slugger's foremost suitors—but the contract itself is relatively straightforward where Ohtani's was elaborate. Which, I should note before we finally get to the paragraph with the numbers in it, does not make any of it any easier to process.",

Entering the race weekend, Norris and his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri had a tangible goal in mind: Outscore Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz by 21 points (or more), and the papaya-clad team would lift its first Constructors' Championship trophy since 1998. Given that Leclerc had a bit of a kerfuffle in qualifying on top of a 10-grid penalty for an engine swap, leaving him starting in 19th, this felt like a shoo-in for McLaren.\nThen, as he often does in good and bad ways, Max Verstappen struck. This time, he did so quite literally: On the first turn of the race, Verstappen, who started fifth, tried to overtake Piastri in typical Verstappen manner, and misjudged his dive bomb, instead hitting Piastri and spinning both drivers to the back of the grid.",

The way it was won, specifically the player who won it, makes the outcome feel more indicative than a normal regular season game. Let me explain.\nThe regular season is interminable and every team must manage its efforts in Winter to be prepared for the games that matter in Spring, and so not all 82 games are going to be bangers, or even enlivened by extreme physical efforts or bold competitive displays. The schedule dictates that a decent number of games with big rest or travel disparities will tilt one way, and so not all games will feel as significant for both teams. But winning still matters, and like its colleagues such as the National TV Showcase and These Guys Want To Kill Each Other and Check This Shit Out: We Broke Math games, the Double Desperation game is given higher stakes by its participants' circumstances.",

          "description": "Michael Koresky begins his 2004 essay on M. Night Shyamalan’s The Village with a question: Is allegory in American cinema dead? Koresky, perceptive in his diagnosis of the post-millennium American audience as a stunned and stunted one, entertained the possibility that a literate Hollywood cinema was waning because few adults in the country read. Twenty years later, I wonder if there’s also the added element that allegory is difficult to swallow, at once too obvious and too subtle, nothing we haven’t heard before and nothing we want to hear again. \nIt’s a dangerous time for a critic, in the wake of an event as seismic as a presidential election, to engage with art when people are trying to inject meaning into cultural objects that don’t have any. This impulse is understandable; most reactions, as I’ve seen people reassure one another online, are understandable in the wake of a traumatic return to a worse status quo. But even that characterization, trauma, feels false, hyperbolic not because there is no threat to what is coming, but because the therapy-speak that saturates so much discourse does everything but engage with, even combat the thing that occasions trauma. To endeavor to create a substantive allegory out of the social and political elements that cause so much distress at a given time, whether the so-called Trump era or post-9/11, seems foolish, naive, but these are the same descriptors that have stalked Shyamalan’s career from the very beginning.",

The first store I entered in Beijing explained some parts of this phenomenon: In China, as elsewhere outside the U.S., MLB is a streetwear brand, not a sports league. Subsequent research filled in the rest: MLB is licensed in East Asia by a South Korean retailer, which has successfully turned it into a billion-dollar enterprise in China.\nThis means that you can more easily find MLB-branded gear in more styles in China—handbags, puffer coats, eared beanies, puffier(?) baseball caps—than wandering around a city in the United States. The trade-off is extreme limitations in team selection. The streetwear brand's detachment from the actual sport of baseball and its attendant loyalties has odd side effects: In two separate stores, in two separate cities, I encountered window displays of mannequins wearing both Yankees and Red Sox gear. In response to this phenomenon, Barry Petchesky, Yankees fan, offered the following comments: \"Oh [no]\" and \"They love that stupid heart shirt!!\" I think it's a sweatshirt, Barry, but I agree with the sentiment.

Drew, for his part and to his credit, is never self-conscious about it; he really cares about the Vikings like that, and he really follows the fine points of the sport like that, so this is a very natural way for him to talk and be. I am less that way, both because I care about my team of choice so much less and because football is a sport I've always kept at something like arm's length. So it was strange, both during the recording of this week's NFL-heavy episode and in listening back to the finished product, to hear someone who sounds so much like me so obviously enjoying Talking Football like this. Can you be highly interested in something that you're pretty sure you don't entirely like? Given how much I have written about American politics, maybe I shouldn't be surprised that the answer is yes. But I think, here, the proof is very much in the podding.",

          "description": "Originally, when the Michigan Wolverines beat the Ohio State Buckeyes 13-10 and decided to plant their flag on the Buckeyes logo, I found it amusing. The fact that those Buckeyes who'd just gotten embarrassed decided to fight the Wolverines over the disrespectful gesture made me roll my eyes. You had 60 minutes to fight, don't start now.\nThis feeling lasted until later that evening however, when I watched my beloved, terrible Florida State lose to our rivals, the Florida Gators. Which was expected. But when those Gators tried to plant their flag on our logo, I felt my blood boil. And when Florida State's players started fighting to defend our field from desecration, I felt pride—although the team didn't put up much of a fight there, either. But my divergent response to identical acts forced me to ask myself why I suddenly, hypocritically got upset seeing those Gators do what I supported the Wolverines doing. The answer is simple: It's because this still matters. The game, the rivalry, the aftermath, it all matters, to the fans and the players.",

Draft a star, trade a mope, fire a coach, sell the team, move the team, as many times as necessary—if you don't like something about your past, change it. People will forget, even New York Jets fans.\nThis brings us to the new Toronto WNBA franchise selecting Tempo as its nickname, and the explanation as provided by its current marketing team. As it currently exists, this is among the most objectively risible nicknames in all of North American sports. It will change, of course, but we might as well celebrate it while we can.",

          "description": "For all the intricate sets that earned rookie coach JJ Redick tumescent praise, the confident protestations that this would be a different Los Angeles Lakers team, the relatively well-managed Bronny James circus, and another year of clean health from LeBron James Sr. and Anthony Davis, the Lakers are 22 games into the season currently looking, overall, like a slightly worse version of their derelict 2023-24 squad. Well, that whole-season view may even be slightly generous: On a narrower timeframe, they have looked like one of the worst teams in basketball for two weeks. In the eight games since L.A. has had to play real teams again after crafting a six-game win streak against the league's dross, the Lakers are 2-6 and lost those six games by an average of 21.8 points. Congrats, JJ Redick: You're only one game off the 13-9 pace set by the dearly departed Darvin Ham.\nWednesday night's 134-93 loss to the Miami Heat was the Lakers' most embarrassing effort yet, though the team found it in them to author my favorite defensive possession of the season. Basketball wisdom dictates that defense is a collective endeavor, a postulate typically proven true by good units whose five players respond to each other and move in concert, or by bad individual defenders who can be singled out and, by their individual weakness, compromise the team's solidity. What distinguishes this Lakers possession, from early in the second half, from the familiar genera of blown rotation-style errors is that its failures are genuinely collective. It takes five individuals each making a series of incorrect decisions in rapid succession to produce such an unintentional masterwork.",

          "description": "Lonzo Ball has been through hell. This is the very firm impression made by an ESPN story published Thursday and written by Ramona Shelburne and Jamal Collier. Ball has spent most of three years dealing with a persistent injury to his left knee; the knee itself spent much of that time steadily worsening. The injury was characterized by cartilage damage and sharp, overwhelming, hostile pain, the kind of malevolent invading pain that shifts around under the surface, expanding and tunneling and throbbing with its own vile heartbeat. Reading about it makes my skin crawl. Months and months of this shit. Pain that started with an innocuous jammed knee and then blossomed into a debilitating but fundamentally mysterious chronic condition, and which defeated several surgeries and thousands of hours of rehabilitation and physical therapy.\nBall had a cartilage replacement procedure in March 2023, and from that point forward his condition has been steadily improving. This was apparently a risky maneuver, and indeed his surgeon attempted to talk him out of it, on the grounds that it might not work and could even make things worse. It worked, or has worked so far, and Ball is back on the court this season for the Chicago Bulls (more or less; he's missed 16 games with wrist troubles, and has played fewer than 100 total minutes), which is great news and a feel-good story.",
