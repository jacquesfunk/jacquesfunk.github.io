          "description": "In January, Emma Hayes called in 50 players to train with the USWNT. Twenty-six were with the senior national team, and the rest were part of a Futures camp, which was meant to develop and scout young prospects. It was all part of Hayes’s mission to revamp the American women’s soccer system at all levels. Since then, she’s laid out a far-reaching plan that details how she hopes to push the American soccer world to reframe its goals from matching the men’s game to doing instead whatever is best for female players specifically. The effects of that blueprint, or “The WNT Way” as she calls it, will only be evident years down the line. But where Hayes does have total control, and where results are more prompt, is with the senior national team. Most immediately, she would have to select a 23-player roster for the SheBelieves Cup.\nU.S. Soccer created the poorly named tournament in 2016 as an alternative to the Algarve Cup. It’s not a tournament that means much on its face, other than being a guaranteed three games against strong opposition at a regular lull in the international soccer calendar. With more than two years to go before the next major tournament, this SheBelieves Cup provided a good opportunity for the USWNT to tinker with its roster and tactics.",

Evidence of both attributes could be seen on Thursday night, when, after leading by 17 at one point in a game against Golden State, Orlando looked poised for a statement win against a surging Warriors squad. But God had other plans, and by God I mean the 6-foot-2 demon with No. 30 on his chest who goes by the name Steph Curry.\nCurry scored a personal season-high 56 points on 16-of-25 shooting, 12 of those makes coming from three-point range. He hit one shot from well behind the half-court line shot to end the first half, and scored 22 points in the third quarter alone, outscoring the entire Magic team in that period. Whether it's invigoration from the arrival of Jimmy Butler (the Warriors have won seven of their last eight), or if he just had the juice flowing last night, Curry put on a prime performance, the likes of which we haven't often seen from him this year. The Warriors needed every bit of it to overcome Butler's off night and the aforementioned double-digit deficit.",

          "description": "While Emilia Perez star Karla Sofía Gascón’s racist tweets, and blackface allegations related to I’m Still Here lead actress Fernanda Torres have been grabbing headlines, the more overlooked 2025 Oscars scandal continues to be egregious nomination snubs for Black-led performances. The most notable omissions were Marianne Jean-Baptiste for Mike Leigh’s Hard Truths, Danielle Deadwyler for Malcolm Washington’s The Piano Lesson, Clarence Maclin for Greg Kwedar’s Sing Sing, and Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor for RaMell Ross’s Nickel Boys. And while Nickel Boys did receive Best Picture and Adapted Screenplay nominations, the most baffling Oscar oversights were in the technical categories: Jomo Fray for Nickel Boys' cinematography and RaMell Ross for directing and film editing. Nickel Boys is a masterpiece, and it’s here where the film is the most experimental, inventive, and alive to the possibilities of cinema. \nRoss's 2018 debut feature, the unconventional, Oscar-nominated documentary, Hale County This Morning, This Evening, follows the life of two Black high school students from Hale County, Ala., where the documentarian and visual artist spent five years immersed in the rural Black communities as a photography teacher, capturing footage. The film bends time and linearity to craft a communal tapestry of the banality and nuance of life in the Black Belt region, as well as early Black cinema (e.g., Lime Kiln Club Field Day). Ultimately, what emerges is what Ross names his “source code” for the recordkeeping of Black southern life liberated from the dominant ways of seeing. Ross’s second feature builds upon the “empowered black data” laid forth in the contemporary through Hale County to attend to the forgotten Black boys of the Jim Crow South and its afterlives.",

          "description": "In a presidential administration with an unlimited capacity for chaos, colleges and universities have become targets of this early phase of right-wing assault. This is not so surprising: Many of the key political threads that comprise today’s Trumpism share an opposition to the academy and all it represents. Chris Rufo has presided over the dismantling of New College of Florida and succeeded in smuggling his bespoke interpretations of concepts like “DEI” and “critical race theory” into state law and now federal policy. JD Vance has appeared at gatherings of national conservatives to say that “professors are the enemy.”\nTrump’s newest allies in Silicon Valley may worship a narrow idea of intelligence, but they view the long apprenticeship, not to mention the still-broad education required of the traditional college student, as a waste of time. And then there is Trump’s traditional base, which splits decisively along educational lines: educational attainment now reliably predicts support for the Democratic Party. Trump, for his part, has said that he loves “the poorly educated”—and they love him back! From another quarter, the battle is joined by MAHA types, COVID skeptics, and Big Pharma truthers who see the country’s medical research apparatus as a machine for laundering money into dubiously valuable experiments that make Americans sicker and the pharmaceutical companies that sell medical remedies richer. What Americans really need, in their view, is raw milk, beef tallow, and a few weeks on the happy farm.",

          "description": "For a team that scores goals by the bucketful, it's interesting that Barcelona's game is designed first and foremost around the pass. It's not that the squad doesn't have finishers: Old Man Robert Lewandowski remains a (silver) fox in the box; Ferran Torres, Fermín López, and Dani Olmo all, as they say, have goals in them; and, by some sort of arcane ethno-numerological magic, Barça's current Brazilian No. 11, Raphinha, has this year transformed into Barça's former Brazilian No. 11, Rivaldo. But the three players who form Barça's foundation in this unexpectedly amazing season are Pau Cubarsí, Lamine Yamal, and Pedri. And each of them individually, and therefore the team collectively, is defined by their genius for passing.\nLamine's passing is naturally the showiest. Of all the skills that make up the teenager's world-class present and his limitless future potential, it's his gift for the final ball that stands out as the most differential today. At just 17 years old he already has a trademark move, the trivela pass, one of the most difficult and visually arresting techniques in the game. Cubarsí's passing is maybe the most readily identifiable. There are passes he hits—be they bombs over the top of the opposition back line, jackknifed balls that cut through tiny crevices to find teammates between enemy lines, or disguised ones that his body shapes toward one direction until at the last second he swivels his action-figure hips and sends them off at a completely different angle—that look more like what a Pirlo-style midfielder might try than a central defender. There's genuinely no other center back right now who's executing complicated passes like Cubarsí, who is himself only 18 years old. But while those two certainly play a major role in forming the team's style, the true orchestrator of all the pretty little passes that bypass pressure, unbuckle defenses, and tee up Lewandowski and Raphinha and the rest for the goals that have made Barça one of the two standout teams in Europe this season, is Pedri.",

          "description": "Readers of young adult fiction, who have long been drawn to stories that combine relatable characters and fantastical elements (think Twilight or The Hunger Games), have been aging into new reading levels and more adult content. Enter Romantasy, which combines romance and fantasy elements. It is currently one of the fastest growing publishing genres and a “massive focus” for TikTok fandoms. No small part of the popularity of Romantasy is owing to the fact that the genre has associations beyond its mix of romance plots with otherworldly imaginative settings and characters. These associations are … sexual. Romantasy usually has what fans call “spice.” Readers can expect detailed, extended, and—naturally—extraordinary sex scenes. Extraordinary how, exactly?\nA remarkable range of popular contemporary romantasy series feature relationships between human women and non-human males, from dragons to mermen. There is Sarah J. Maas’s A Court of Thorns and Roses and its sequels, in which women commingle with immortal faeries; Carissa Broadbent’s The Serpent and the Wings of Night, featuring a female protagonist who is the only human daughter of a vampire king, or Tentacle Entanglement, a “monster mates” book by “Siggy Shade,” the title of which tells you what you need to know. Often these relationships involve “fated mates,” with the males unable to escape an exorable drive to love the women with the utmost passionate devotion. All of these are huge on BookTok. What is the appeal of these novels, and why do they seem to be proliferating now?",

For that reason, we turn our attention to the Emma Woodhouses of the NHL.\nAfter the extended 4 Nations break, it's a bit of a jolt to realize that so many teams are suddenly back to high-stakes action on a schedule that feels pretty scrunched. Out in the West, six playoff spots read as extremely secure, while the remaining two look like a battle among Colorado, Calgary, and Vancouver, with perhaps Utah as a dark horse. I want to focus on the East, however, because that's where the drama already has me biting my nails. Six teams are reasonably comfortable, but below them, we've got five squads auditioning for the two wild card roles. Three of these teams would see a playoff berth as a relieving breakthrough after a long struggle; the other two would be severely disappointed in themselves if they let this year go to waste. Here is a quick guide to them all, starting with seventh place and working our way down.",

I have touristed my way around many cities with my wife and children in tow, which meant negotiating air travel, hotel reservations, restaurant reservations, museum reservations, shopping excursions, and every other tourist chore with their needs in mind. Truly exhausting shit. This explains why I’m the sort of person who treats business travel as a meditative experience. When I’m off the clock in any new city, I take full advantage. I go where I want. I see what I want. And, most vital, I eat what I want.\nWhich brings us to Pittsburgh. I was in the Steel City for my first time, on a super top secret assignment for Defector Media. I was told by people I trusted that, despite the presence of multiple Steelers fans, Pittsburgh is a surprisingly cool place to hang. They were right. The city’s downtown is alive. The Pirates ballpark is so perfectly situated along the banks of the Allegheny River that the home team doesn’t even have to win to give you your money’s worth (and it doesn’t). And the Andy Warhol Museum contains some of the most arresting works of art I’ve ever had the pleasure of beholding. One of my favorite pieces inside of it was the one that Warhol and his friends pissed on.",

          "description": "One of my brightest childhood memories was experiencing the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone for the first time. My mom spent a few summers working in a cafeteria at Mammoth Hot Springs by the north entrance, so she knew the park well enough to have me and my brother look down at our feet through the short hike to the observation platform. She knew that the experience of all that empty air and angry water was one worth having as suddenly and forcefully as possible. I remember distinctly how small it made me feel, how awestruck I was that it was merely a grand canyon, not even one to merit the definite article. It is important to feel small, overjoyed, or fascinated by the outdoors, and to learn about the world and one's place in it through those feelings.\nEight decades into the gradual privatization of once-public postwar spoils, and despite climate change frenzying the competition for land, more than a third of the land in the United States is administered by federal agencies, mostly the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service. The vast majority of this land is west of the Rockies, in areas of low population density on the old American frontier. That includes almost two-thirds of Nevada (and my namesake I-80 exit); the second-largest desert preserve in the world; and the highest and lowest points in the continental United States, which are separated by less than 100 miles' worth of one of the most beautiful regions of California. These lands are the only parts of the country that both are for everyone and whose chief utility is, well, nothing. You can camp for 14 nights without a permit on most BLM land. There are economies built around them—tourism and all manner of gear companies—though the land itself is only faintly capitalized by private industry. Logging companies do harvest a bit of timber from Forest Service land, and there's some agriculture, but only enough to underscore how much of it is just kind of sitting there. That is to say: Most of the land is administered as if it's useless.",

But these words appeared, in this order, in a report recently published in the journal Current Biology titled \"Innovative flavoring behavior in Goffin’s cockatoos,\" which only made me feel intrigued. A cockatoo innovation, you say? Regarding flavoring? Tell me more!\nAs I read the abstract, I realized that the key innovation of this new paper was innovated by nine cockatoos, all of whom had learned to drag a noodle through a puddle of blueberry-flavored soy yogurt.

          "description": "The Los Angeles Lakers eked out a win Tuesday night over the visiting Dallas Mavericks, 107–99. The win keeps the rising Lakers a scant few percentage points up on the Houston Rockets for the West's fourth seed; the loss leaves Dallas perilously close to the bottom of the conference play-in. Neither team will have to scrounge around too desperately for encouragement: The Lakers played choppy, underwhelming basketball, but got the hero stuff they needed from their best guys and eventually took care of business; the Mavericks looked sharper and better organized but were handicapped by injuries and doomed by an off-shooting night. In basketball terms, this was not a memorable game, just one of those February work-nights where no one has it going but someone has to win.\nBecause it was the first contest between these two teams since the Luka Doncic trade, assessing it solely in basketball terms misses quite a lot of context. \"It was just a lot of emotions and not much sleep,\" said a wrung-out and relieved Doncic, who had an off night despite posting a triple-double. \"It was a different game ... I'm just glad it's over, honestly.\" Tension was high, at least in the early going: Doncic picked up a technical foul in the game's third minute for objecting to a swallowed whistle. Later in the quarter, when he bombed home a deep three-pointer and turned to glare at Dallas's bench, television cameras picked up several of his former teammates grinning and laughing in what appeared to be sincere appreciation. They're bigger men—literally and figuratively—than I: Being mean-mugged by a former colleague for an unpopular decision made by management would cause me to boil with indignation; if Tom Ley trades Luis Paez-Pumar to Wired, Luis had better direct his vengeful showboating at Tom damn Ley, or summon a competent second and face me in a duel at sunrise!

It's a sports-y sounding name for something we all might be familiar with, that feeling when morale tends to hit a low point in the third quarter of long missions. It makes sense that the middle is always the roughest time. The beginning and end benefit from excitement, either from just beginning or from being almost done. Right in the middle of a process is usually where morale sags the most, so if you can get through that period, things will almost certainly start to feel better. \nWe are smack dab in the middle of the third quarter of The Artist's Way, and morale is sagging, predictably.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was incredible in both, notching 76 total points, 18 rebounds, and 16 assists. If you wanted to understand what makes SGA so good and cool, Sunday night's 130-123 gem was the ideal one-game sample; if you want to understand why he matters so much and why the largely untouchable Thunder still face so many big questions, Monday night's horrific loss was equally instructive.\nSo much of what makes the Thunder special is collective: their heat-seeking defense, unmatchable depth, team-wide shooting. As team setups go, having a dozen players who can defend as if armed and who generally play basketball at what appears to be 1.25x speed is certainly more unusual and interesting than surrounding one or two superstars with a roster purpose-built to their talents. The Thunder's formula does, however, rely on a number of stylistic hallmarks that tend to be marginalized by the differences between regular and postseason hoops. Can they still force turnovers on like every third possession in the playoffs? Will their depth really matter when they have to play against opposing rotations stripped of all their weak players?",

And to also ask people today, or readers today: How can we allow this to happen? How could we allow something like Gaza to happen?\"\nThe World After Gaza, based off Mishra's 2024 essay for the London Review of Books, uses the historical context following World War II to deliver a meaningful reminder: The West did not welcome Holocaust survivors with open arms. In fact, the global powers treated them as a nuisance and looked to relocate them elsewhere. The current-day narrative, that the West immediately recognized the Holocaust was an atrocity, is a comforting fiction. As is, Mishra argues, the idea that the international standard of laws and norms set in 1945 can remain legitimate after having been abandoned in service to Israeli objectives.",

          "description": "In 2016, when Donald Trump was elected president the first time, people felt scared but also called to action. Protests began instantly, starting literally the day after the election. People were hyper aware of Trump's attempts to lie to the public, were vigilant about his racist, xenophobic, homophobic, and sexist policies, and were vocal in their opposition throughout his term in office. Within that storm of dissent, rap music echoed its revolutionary past by sounding off against Trump. Artists like Snoop Dogg and Jay-Z voiced their anger. Acts like A Tribe Called Quest and YG wrote protest songs. Any given verse of the era was likely to include at least one stray line aimed at the president; my personal favorite was Young Thug's \"I'll slap the shit out Donald Trump any day\" on Swae Lee's \"Offshore.\"\nThis seemed to genuinely bother Trump. Trump had long been a folk hero for rappers, as rappers have a tendency to be our most vocal champions of ruthless capitalism. Trump's combination of wealth, outsized bravado, attention-hungry charisma, and over-the-top egomania put him on similar terms with Ric Flair and Tony Montana, two characters who are also exalted in rap songs. Plenty of rappers never bought into his persona certainly, but he was a source of inspiration for many, as proven by how often he was name-checked. Rappers turning on him had to feel like a betrayal to a creature as vain as Trump.",

I was lucky enough to be born in Michigan in 1995, just before the Red Wings restored their old glory with back-to-back Stanley Cup wins, and the state's enthusiasm for that team implanted in me a love for the sport that's inextricable from my sense of self. There's video evidence to prove this—me sitting on the floor, lording over a rink symbolized by an oval-shaped train track, using blocks as players while I played PA announcer for an imaginary game at Joe Louis Arena. When I was a few years older, I remember making use of a big, bench-like windowsill at the front of our house, orchestrating games with action figures of guys like Brendan Shanahan, Sergei Fedorov, Paul Kariya, and Peter Forsberg. In the basement, I'd watch VHS recaps of the Wings' '98 Cup triumph, or a compilation of interviews and player profiles for stars like Chris Chelios and Pavel Bure.\nWhat all those players had in common, from my perspective, was that they were established greats, and my knowledge had to catch up to their careers. But that all changed in 2005, when a pair of heavily hyped young prospects each made their debut in the aftermath of a season-cancelling lockout. Alex Ovechkin, first overall in 2004, and Sidney Crosby, picked No. 1 in 2005, were the future. They were the first NHLers I was conscious of knowing before they were actually in the NHL. And as their careers inch closer to the finish line, and I creep closer to my 30th birthday, I'm extra aware of the conduit that these two provide to the person I was two decades ago. I watched them excel then as I do now, but on Saturday, I saw them both play live for the very first time.",

          "description": "Twice already this regular season the website Defector has posted blogs about how the horrid and miserable Philadelphia 76ers might be stabilizing and revving up for a charge up the standings. Ridiculous, foolish, irresponsible blog behavior. No more of this! The 76ers are cooked. A last-second bucket Saturday by Nic Claxton of the aimless Brooklyn Nets sent Philly to its seventh consecutive loss and ninth in 10 games, dropping them to a season-worst 16 games below .500. They now hold the 12th seed in the Eastern Conference, one game in the loss column out of the bottom of the play-in and a whopping 10.5 games from the sixth seed. Do not stop with a single fork: Empty your silverware drawer into a cannon, aim the cannon at their cowering forms, and fire away. It would be a mercy.\nIt is possible to drop a game to a bad team without necessarily being a very bad team yourself. The 76ers are very bad. Their core was in place Saturday and was roundly outplayed by the various fungible goobers presently filling out Brooklyn's rotation. Tyrese Maxey was his usual heroic self, but Paul George was in Tobias Harris mode, and Joel Embiid was history's saddest statue. Brooklyn led most of the way, and very comfortably through the middle quarters, until a spell of sloppy offense and a Philly rebounding edge allowed the otherwise punchless 76ers back into the game late. Notably, Embiid touched the court not at all in the fourth quarter, which head coach Nick Nurse chalked up unconvincingly to the chemistry of the lineup on the floor. To their credit, the 76ers played with spirit down the stretch, but they needed a pair of missed freebies to stay within a bucket, and the game-winner came on an embarrassingly anticlimactic put-back of what should've been an easy defensive rebound for George.",

          "description": "PITTSBURGH — I was a little surprised by the seriousness of The Andy Warhol Museum. For an artist I associate with playful experimentation, the seven-story building off the northwest bank of the Allegheny is more a tribute to the professionalism, work ethic, and marketing acumen that made Warhol the most recognizable artist of his era—or any that's come since. The layout is tightly chronological, with the four main floors each representing a decade in its patron saint's career. The information presented is devoid of tabloid gossip, keeping Warhol's international fame completely incidental to the narrative of his artistic output. And the only time I laughed out loud was at these deadpan info boxes next to Oxidation, which never break character even as they describe the process of creation through urination, and note ongoing study of the piss painting with a straight-faced \"Conservation Challenge.\"",

          "description": "Coaches and managers have a tenuous relationship with the veracity of the spoken word, which is to say that when they speak in public, they are generally either lying or setting up their next lie. Frankness rarely serves them well in any context, which is why they avoid it like a pair of anthrax-infused burlap compression shorts. Everything is a message meant for someone else—to confound or mislead opponents, to placate a dungheaded boss, to motivate a slothful player—and the public exists mostly as a conduit through which that message can find its intended target.\nAnd then there's Ruben Amorim, currently having his pants filled daily with red ants as the coach at Manchester United. He finds his inherited team perpetually irksome and clearly cannot wait for the offseason when he can remake it in his tactical image and likeness. This is not speculation, to be clear. It was obvious from the middle of January, when Amorim said this might be the worst Manchester United team of all time. I mean, that's prime talk show stuff right there, and until United either get better or fire him, it will have a resonance that rivals Bill Parcells' \"You are what your record says you are,\" or Jim Mora's \"Playoffs? Playoffs?\"",

Look at it from time to time, sure; let a game lay down a baseline level of low-intensity audio noise in the background by all means. It takes time to remember this, or just the length of one regulation winter to forget it. But as the days got longer and crueler and worse and the start of the baseball season began to feel less abstract if only minimally less distant, I tried to remind myself of this. There was going to be something that looked and sounded acceptably like baseball, and soon, and it was worth looking forward to that. But once it actually got here, I would need to remember not to overindulge. Let it back in, please and thank you, but do it like an IV drip—a little bit at a time, invisibly, to put a little bit of color in your cheeks.\nSpring training is longer than it needs to be. It takes time for ballplayers to get back into playing shape, but nothing like the sort of time it took back when ballplayers spent their winters working second jobs or eating big greasy joints of mutton. Players do not arrive at spring training quite so wheezing and gouty anymore, or at least the percentage that arrive slicked in mutton sweat is lower than it was. MLB players stay in shape, they improve over the winter by refining their craft near the homes they own in states that don't have income taxes, or by throwing in front of high-speed cameras and coaches in converted warehouse spaces. But if it does not take a month and a half for contemporary ballplayers to look like ballplayers, it does take a while for the ballgames to look or feel like ballgames.",

When you had molted enough to settle on the seafloor, you spent your days scuttling around the chandelier-like roots of mangroves and nibbling on leaf litter. Then, one day, you found yourself scooped up into a plastic container, tied to a string, and anchored to coral rubble off the Raja Ampat islands of eastern Indonesia. There you must wait until your worst nightmare appears. It might look like a gray spaceship, one dark stripe moving across its body in the gloaming sea. It might look like a leaf, olive green and drifting slowly toward you. It might resemble an innocuous branching coral, arms kinked outward. Or, most mysteriously, it might appear as a whitish specter containing one dark, pulsing inkblot that appears and vanishes as it comes your way. But it does not much matter which of these four (sea)horsemen of your apocalypse heaves onto your horizon, because by the time they have come, it is already too late. You, precious crab, are about to become dinner.\nA group of scientists have described the four distinct hunting displays of the broadclub cuttlefish in a paper recently published in the journal Ecology. They also captured video footage of each display—passing-stripe, leaf, branching coral, and pulse—from the perspective of the final moments of a crab (RIP).",

          "description": "The most compelling reasons not to trade Luka Doncic are not the administrative kind, but those reasons exist, too. Weaker-minded decision-makers would have been stopped by more urgent basketball and business considerations having to do with Doncic being a historically good player beloved by the team's fans, and dismissed the urge to deal Doncic as a fleeting call-of-the-void-type impulse. But the Dallas Mavericks' new ownership and GM Nico Harrison were able to see, beneath the jarringly ruddy exterior of the 25-year-old superstar who carried an otherwise unremarkable team to the NBA Finals just last season, a toxic and fast-depreciating asset that needed to be jettisoned 1) immediately and 2) in secret. That trade happened three weeks ago, which turned out to be much more time than was necessary for it to blow up on the Mavericks. Basically no one understands any of it.\nAnd, again, that is just the top-line stuff. The deal itself might not have been anything more than the faulty whim of the team's bummy new ownership, represented in this case by a man who looks like the result of entering \"business doll boy (real)\" into an AI image generator, and facilitated by a GM with a dangerously advanced case of Contemporary Success Guy brain. It might just be one of those classic deals that instantly immolates a generation or so of fan goodwill and makes a team worse in both the near-term and long-term, made out of spite or boredom or just as the result of a decision-making process that is the result of having contracted some sort of debilitating brain spore from a Mar-a-Lago steam-table entree. This does not make it any easier to parse, to be clear, and also doesn't really explain anything. Also in retrospect that sort of trade is not really one of the classic kind of deals that exist, at least beyond the extent to which the Hindenburg could be said to represent one of the classic kinds of dirigible excursions one could have.",

          "description": "On a long enough time scale and if the sport is widely popular, a country tends to lose its dominance in a sport it creates. England ceded soccer long ago. The U.S. is, perhaps, in the process of losing its unquestioned position as the supreme basketballing nation. Canada, not for the first time and certainly not the last, faces a reckoning with its place in the hockey world. Since the fall of the U.S.S.R., the top of the sport has become more European, increasingly global, and, above all else, creepingly American. A smaller percentage of NHL players are from Canada than ever before, and more of the best players are from the U.S., as the league has expanded below the border and contracted above it. It's a numbers game, and if it isn't reflected in relative culture cachet, it'll become apparent by who raises the trophies in international competition. Canada may well lose its iron grip on hockey—but not yet.\nTeam Canada re-expressed its dominion with a 3-2 overtime win over the U.S. in the final of the 4 Nations Face-Off, a totally made-up all-star replacement that almost accidentally stumbled its way into becoming a geopolitical referendum, and served as emphatic notice that the sport is still Canada's to lose. I won't drag out this blog before giving you the climactic goal, the one that'll be replayed for years and years. And because the champions wear red maple leaves, you get the Chris Cuthbert call:",
