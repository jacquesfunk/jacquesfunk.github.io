          "description": "For too long, as they suffered under a purple-and-gold yoke, Los Angeles Clippers fans were familiar with a very particular sort of pain: The arena stopped serving alcohol at the end of the third quarter, meaning anyone seeking a premium-style VIP luxury bar experience in the dreary confines of an NBA arena during the fourth quarter was out of luck. The thrill of watching James Harden take his 13th and 14th free throws of the night as the Clips try to overcome a late 11-point deficit just doesn't hit the same without a $22 domestic draft. The experience of recounting said free throws five hours later over a $31 gin and tonic is equally paltry if you can't share it with fellow VIPs in the arena where Harden shot those free throws.\nThankfully, California governor Gavin Newsom has solved this pressing problem. On Sunday, Newsom signed AB-3206, an extremely specific bill that will allow alcohol sales to continue until 4:00 a.m. in VIP areas of the new Clippers arena in Inglewood until Jan. 1, 2030. California state law otherwise prohibits alcohol sales between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m.; now, thanks to the state legislature, an arena that has yet to host its first NBA game can boast of the first exception. The bill does not name the Clippers arena specifically, though its carve-out in state liquor law applies strictly to vendors operating in a \"fully enclosed arena with a seating capacity of at least 18,000 seats located in the City of Inglewood,\" and only within a \"private area in the arena no larger than 2,500 square feet\" after events.",

          "description": "The most honest Francis Ford Coppola has ever been on celluloid isn't present in any of his own movies. Rather, it can be found in a 1991 documentary shot by his wife, Eleanor. Hearts of Darkness, a project started by Eleanor and later finished by co-directors George Hickenlooper and Fax Bahr, tells the story of Francis’s travails while making Apocalypse Now, a movie that was already considered a canonical classic of the New Hollywood era by the time the documentary was released. But at the time of filming, the infamously beleaguered production of Apocalypse Now was just another example of FFC’s limitless, egomaniacal ambition to achieve the ultimate spectacle-as-political-statement, that would speak to something profound about Vietnam, about America, about mankind.\nCoppola at that point in time was one of the biggest directors in the world, coming off his two enormously successful Godfather movies and the critically beloved The Conversation. He had long planned to adapt Joseph Conrad's 1899 novel Heart of Darkness, turning it into a story of the Vietnam War that journeyed into the dark night of the human soul. Eleanor’s documentary is about the dark night of Francis’s soul. At times, he is the picture of the overindulged, male auteur full of grandeur and vanity, holding court on the importance of cinema and art and ambition and himself. At other times, he is a ball of exposed nerves, full of anxiety about the difficulty of the production, about the personal wealth he has poured into the film when outside funding ran out, and, worst of all, about the prospect of failing to make a good movie. At one point, he talks about the sin of pretentiousness, about how every artist is terrified of being seen as pretentious, so much so that they pull back or play safe in detrimental ways. He tells his wife that he cannot allow himself to be afraid to be seen as pretentious, as it’s the only way to really go for it. It is a risk worth taking.",

Taking a soggy field for their contest against the Broncos after a solid 2-1 start, head coach Robert Saleh's boys delivered the kind of performance that makes fans in the stands swear off football for life and turns a star quarterback into a sour prig—well, OK, Aaron Rodgers was already that, but he's aiming it more pointedly at his own guys now.\nEveryone can agree on this: It was not the defense's fault. After holding the Patriots to three points last week, they shut down the pass and only really slipped up on one Denver touchdown drive. Even late in the game, when they could have pleaded exhaustion, they stiffed the Broncos on key plays and put their offense in position to win. They also helped produce this bleak QB stat graphic:",

His puzzles have appeared in The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Universal. He’s thrilled to see his lifelong friend Glenn make his puzzling debut!

You could be Pirates fans, trapped in a cycle of losing by the caprices of your cheapskate organization, which by releasing one fan-favorite player four plate appearances shy of a contract bonus and benching another, did its part to warn off future free agents. You could be Angels fans, who ever so briefly were allowed to believe they would be free of Arte Moreno's reverse Midas touch, and instead just witnessed the team's losingest season in franchise history, has no future prospects, and spent last week making your White Sox look like world-beaters. You could be A's fans, who on Sunday received one last kick in the crotch after 20 years of it, when the final postgame show of Oakland's season and existence was, for unclear reasons, recorded before game 162 was actually played. \"We don’t even know the result of today’s baseball game,\" studio host Brodie Brazil told viewers trying to prolong the last hours of the Oakland Era—a fitting and final fuck-you to a fanbase that's used to them.\nCheer up, White Sox fans! You ended your season with a win on Sunday, something 11 of the 12 playoff teams won't be able to say. It was your fifth win in six games to close the season and avoid passing the '62 Mets for the worst record in the modern era. Sure, OK, maybe a lot of you were hoping for a loss—hoping that each of your 121 losses could at least be in service of history. That might at least have made the losses teleological and thus more bearable, but they must instead stand on their own as the droppings of an epically but not quite historically bad team. Shit for shit's sake.",

          "description": "The collective agreement on what to do after catching a historic baseball is very fiscally responsible, like a financial literacy course titled \"So You Just Won The Lottery.\" The man who caught Shohei Ohtani's 50/50 home run ball would receive full marks: He declined an initial offer—reportedly $300,000—from the Dodgers and contacted an auction house, Goldin, the next day. Seeing as the current highest bid for the ball sits at $1.2 million with over 16 days to go, it was pragmatic and well-executed, if unsentimental, decision-making. As the seller wished to remain anonymous, the ESPN article on the auction instead quotes Goldin CEO and founder, Ken Goldin, and Goldin seizes upon the opportunity to mete out some uncensored self-advertising: \"This is one of those cases where our reputation for getting the absolute highest price on hot-market items [came] into play ... honestly, we had no competition at all.\"\nThis is not moral judgment on the man who caught Ohtani's baseball. Imagine being so composed if a house were to fall into your lap; chance would be a fine thing. Ultimately the point of any item of sports memorabilia is to own it or sell it, and to own a baseball of Ohtani's worth is synonymous with being extremely wealthy.",

But more recently, he's become known as a coach whom players repeatedly reported for emotional abuse and manipulation. Those reports by players did not immediately diminish Dames's power; he only resigned when those accounts began becoming public. The ensuing 234-page Yates report into systemic abuse across women's soccer included his name hundreds of times. \nU.S. Soccer, which oversees the U.S. Women's National Team as well as sanctioning the NWSL, suspended Dames's coaching license and, per USA Today, the federation reported him to the U.S. Center for SafeSport, the organization created by Congress to investigate sexual abuse across Olympic sports. SafeSport doesn't have any jurisdiction over the NWSL, but Dames's presence in the database still mattered, especially given his continued prominence in Chicago-area youth soccer. (The NWSL also banned Dames for life.) SafeSport opened an investigation into Dames, and anyone who searched its database would have found his name.",

          "description": "The past Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix was a farewell for Daniel Ricciardo, but only in retrospect. Reporters had all but confirmed that Liam Lawson would receive a permanent seat at VCARB and Ricciardo's choked up post-race interview seemed to indicate a departure. But neither VCARB, or their owners at Red Bull, had released an official statement. So the day's send-offs took on a half-stated tone, none of which stemmed from his team—the commentators couched declarations about Ricciardo's final race with \"likely\" and \"may.\" Kym Illman, a Formula 1 photographer and fellow Australian, posted a photo mentioning a \"last goodbye hug.\" Fans voted him Driver of the Day.\nVCARB only made the official announcement this Thursday. The outwardly unnecessary four-day delay to the announcement would have been distasteful even for the average driver; that a company of Red Bull's profile made such an oversight could be ascribed to the year's broadly self-inflicted dysfunction that has plagued the Red Bull higher-ups. An explanation does not change the travesty that Ricciardo, a boisterous fan-favorite, is somehow leaving the sport without similarly boisterous fanfare. Putting aside what respect a 13-year career in F1 may or may not demand in return, Ricciardo was the sort of personality that could bear such ceremony: some build-up, a video, an opportunity for other drivers on the grid to share fond memories or embarrassing stories.",

          "description": "CHICAGO — On Tuesday night, the Chicago White Sox had a shot at history, if not the kind any team sets out to make. At 36-120, they were just one loss away from breaking the record for futility since the MLB started scheduling this many games. Late September baseball contests, for two thirds of the league, tend to be either dubious searches for meaning or the barest excuse for drinking beer outside, but this one was played on the precipice of a loserdom that hasn’t been seen since the 19th century, when Cleveland had a 20-134 squad called the Spiders. In the 162-game universe, the White Sox were about to surpass the 1962 New York Mets, who finished their first season of existence at 42-120.\nIt wasn’t going to happen that night. The White Sox had their first late-inning comeback of the entire season, eking out a 3-2 victory over the visiting Los Angeles Angels. In normal terms, the Angels—at 63-94—are very bad as well. They were also the recipient of most of the home crowd’s scant goodwill on that night. When Angels’ second baseman Jack López hit a home run in the seventh to put L.A. up 2-0, Sox fans cheered him—a little too much. “The bleachers were getting real rowdy and people kept getting escorted out,” a friend who was at the game told me. “It felt like folks were ready to rage.” Earlier, fans had been chanting “sell the team” vigorously enough that the Sox-employed television broadcasters couldn’t really ignore it. When the Sox finished their improbable victory, improving their record when playing from behind after the seventh inning to a hilarious 1-94, the home fans booed them for it.",

The frogs, Kurixalus eiffingeri, live in the bamboo and broadleaf forests of Taiwan and parts of Japan, and raise their young in the small pools of water in tree hollows and bamboo stumps called phytotelmata. Ito was interested in the fact that parent frogs fed their tadpoles unfertilized eggs. But he noticed something strange. \"I observed that the tadpoles were not defecating,\" he wrote in an email.\nFrom the moment a Taiwanese tree frog hatches from an egg to the moment it metamorphoses into an adult frog, between 21 and 43 days later, it eats just like any other species of tadpole. But, unlike other tadpoles, it does not appear to poop. It excretes no solid waste whatsoever until a few days after it reaches adulthood. Ito and Okada recently described the remarkable feat of these tadpoles in the journal Ecology.",

It was a final, fitting insult to fans of the Athletics, a team in the AL West that as of today used to play their home games in Oakland. Someone in the building, maybe only one single someone, had cause for celebration—not with the fans but at them.\nWith the future ripped away by John Fisher and the other owners who voted unanimously for this, what would the final major-league game on Oakland soil be like, I wondered? Would it be a party? A riot? How would the Oakland A's, an organization whose stated position to its own fans and the world at large for three years has been, more or less, We do not exist; do not regard us or our product, handle a sold-out crowd? It turns out that a fun funeral is still a funeral, and the energy that A's fans brought to the Coliseum served primarily to underscore the irrationality at the heart of the situation. They showed the baseball-watching world what the A's meant to them, while Fisher and his organization showed how little that mattered.",

Maybe you don't even think they'll win the game, but you do know that every gesture is backed by some intent.",

          "description": "Broadly speaking, episodes of The Distraction that are just Drew and me talking tend to break down into two different styles. They can be kind of digressive in ways that are personal or just extra loopy, and then there are ones that are ... well, it's still a podcast, and it's still this particular podcast, but I was going to say \"focused.\" The idea behind this one was to field a bunch of listener voicemails and do a quick whip-around the sports landscape first, and what it wound up being instead was a decently detailed talk about the NFL, the state of TV color commentary, and the trouble with processing something as unprecedented as Shohei Ohtani's most recent unprecedented season. And then eventually we get to the voicemails about cat poop. But it was a pretty thoughtful podcast for a while there!",

          "description": "Wednesday night marked the second episode of the 47th season of Survivor—and with it, the end of an all-too-brief era. For a certain member of the chattering class, this season held the sort of promise not seen since Mike White nearly conquered that Fijian beach: a chance to watch a famous writer make a fool of themselves on national television. This year's media surrogate was none other than Pod Save America co-host Jon Lovett, a man whose list of former employers includes Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Aaron Sorkin. None of this impressed his tribe, who voted him out at the end of last week's premiere episode.\nThis week's elimination was arguably even more of an upset, but still, I found myself largely unmoved, if not bored. Some important context might be needed here: I'm not a Survivor superfan. I hesitate to even call myself a fan. Until last Wednesday, I'd watched exactly half of one season while high in an AirBnb in Burlington. If reality television is a spectrum, my tastes trend more towards docusoap (think Real Housewives, Wife Swap, Selling Sunset) than competition-based programming. It most likely comes down to the fact that I fundamentally do not understand the kind of person who would voluntarily spend weeks without running water. But what I do understand is podcasters—specifically the kind of podcaster that Lovett is. He's the sort that will say on national television, with an ain't-I-a-stinker face, \"And now when people ask me what I do, I have to say that I'm a fucking podcast host.\"",

          "description": "QUEENS, N.Y. — The final stretch of All Elite Wrestling's annual September blowout at Arthur Ashe Stadium, Grand Slam, feels remarkably similar to the back half of the nighttime tennis doubleheaders that run at these grounds for the U.S. Open a few weeks earlier. Like the Open, there is a primetime segment that captures the audience at peak capacity—for AEW, that's the live airing of their show Dynamite from 8 to 10 p.m. But also like the U.S. Open, there is a lot left for those who stick around late into the night—a whole other tennis match, or, in AEW's case, a taping for one of their other TV obligations that stretches past midnight.\nAs such, when I leave Arthur Ashe, the atmosphere is different than the feeling leaving any other sports arena I've ever entered. The crowd is no longer a cohesive throng high on a win, crushed by a loss, or simply juiced from the action. It's more a collection of individuals thinking, We were the ones who cared enough to stick it out, and Oh god, when am I going to get to sleep?",

Only I know if the Blue Rhino tank is running on empty. And only I know that the two left burners will only ignite if you close the lid and hold down the ignition button until your knuckle cramps. This grill and I are simpatico. Whenever meat is required, we stand ready, together. I love grilling. Every middle aged guy does. It lets you play with fire, it gives you a chance to eat food before serving it, and it gives you an excuse to start drinking.",

Adams was indicted by a grand jury and is being charged by federal prosecutors with five counts of bribery, wire fraud, and soliciting illegal foreign campaign donations. The news broke Wednesday night and the indictment was unsealed Thursday morning; the full 57-page indictment can be read at the bottom of this blog.\nThis follows a series of FBI raids, subpoenas and resignations among the mayor's confidants and cabinet members for a growing web of investigations that, incredibly, may be about assorted corruptions entirely unrelated to today's indictment.

          "description": "The sea robin begins its life looking like any other fish: a finned, larval speck drifting in the open ocean. As the sea robin grows, the pectoral fins on either side of its body widen like two unfurling fans—still fins, if a bit extravagant. But eventually the first three rays of each fin separate. They lose their webbing, tapering into slender structures that look remarkably like legs. When adult sea robins settle on the seafloor, where they will spend the rest of their lives, they use these \"legs\" to walk, stilt-like, the rest of their body hovering a few inches above the sand.\nCorey Allard, a cell biologist and electrophysiologist at Harvard University, knew sea robins as the fish his dad and brothers frequently reeled in from the Atlantic. But he did not realize they had legs until he saw them at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. \"Never looked that closely, I guess, nor expected a fish to have legs like that,\" Allard said.",

          "description": "Since the arrival of NIL and the decision that college athletes deserve to be compensated for their work on the field, the NCAA, along with universities, have done everything they can to avoid responsibility for ensuring that compensation is distributed in a fair and orderly fashion. The last few years have constituted a desperate bid to maintain the illusion of amateurism, and in that desperation the NCAA and the schools have turned to boosters, NIL collectives, and corporate sponsors to keep the money flowing. As a result, NIL, while nice in theory, is deeply flawed and about as lawful and orderly as the old wild west.\nMany of the problems with the current NIL system are now fully on display thanks to Matthew Sluka, the UNLV transfer who has been the starting quarterback for the Rebels during their hot 3-0 start. The team is expected to compete for the Mountain West title and now, thanks to the 12-team playoff, have a real chance at competing for the group of five slot in the bracket. Sluka, who had spent the four years prior as a dual-threat QB at FCS Holy Cross, claims that he was verbally promised $100,000 by a UNLV assistant coach to transfer over, but has only received a $3,000 relocation stipend. As a result, Sluka announced on Wednesday that he intends to redshirt and will not play for the remainder of the season.",
