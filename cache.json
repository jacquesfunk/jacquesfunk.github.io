The then-21-year-old striker had made her first senior national team appearance in March of 2010, and scored earlier on in that World Cup, but it was in the final that she broke through. She had jumped off the screen throughout the tournament in substitute appearances, with her speed and technique and nose for goal combining into a galloping force next to the more static Abby Wambach. In the 69th minute of the final, she had her moment of glory, as a long ball from Megan Rapinoe bounced behind the Japanese back-line, allowing Morgan to run past, and through, the defense before opening the scoring with a tough cross-goal shot:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waLFeW3aHgQ",

O'Keefe, one of the more baroquely damaged defectives in reactionary media, is destroying less notable lives now than he did during the years when the videos he produced led to the resignations of NPR executives and the collapse of the activist organization ACORN, but his rancid body of work is compelling proof that the destruction is something like its own reward for him.\nO'Keefe's taste in enemies has never been especially creative, which reflects both what vintage of conservative he is—vain, pretentious, and relentlessly aggrieved, with strong notes of metro-NYC suburbia psychosis on the finish—and the business that he's in. Project Veritas, which O'Keefe built by crafting videos that exposed various conservative culture-war enemies in ways built to fit their laziest media caricatures, was a nonprofit business supported by rich conservatives, and so generally aimed to scratch the recurring itches of those old, dull, nasty people. Sometimes, as with ACORN, O'Keefe got the results he sought. Mostly, he succeeded in helping people whose politics revolve around being scandalized and upset remain in their desired state of agitation, and in raising money from them to help with his many lawsuits.",

Each bottle contained a hefty sardine bathed in vegetable oil, and the carousel was programmed to release one sardine every two weeks to attract the deep-sea fish skulking in the area. The muddy bottom served as stomping grounds for sleek sablefish, noodly eelpouts and hagfish, and flabby snailfish, all of whom roam in nearly absolute darkness, aside from glimmers of bioluminescence.\nAt more than 2,000 feet deep, the observatory one of many deep-sea observatories set up by Ocean Networks Canada, all capturing real-time data of creatures living in the area. The researchers wanted to learn if the fish in the canyon behaved differently around bait in the presence of artificial lights. \"Some are attracted, and some avoid it,\" Héloïse Frouin-Mouy, a marine biologist and bio-acoustician specializing in marine mammals at the University of Miami, wrote in an email.

Anyone age 13 or older can take part, which is perhaps why my first introduction to what its adherents call NaNoWriMo came through Tumblr, where every November 1 seemingly half of my dashboard disappeared overnight.  \nFor 30 days and 30 nights, my mutuals tinkered away at their novels (and then snuck back onto Tumblr to complain about how hard that tinkering was). They asked me to yell at them if I saw them posting. And then, one by one, they gave up their novels and returned to replenishing my feeds with One Direction GIFs and essays on colonialism in the Avatar: The Last Airbender universe. Over time I got the impression that NaNoWriMo was more of a community-building enterprise than a pure literary one. I was never tempted to take part myself. Mostly out of laziness, but I was also never quite convinced that any novel I wrote in a month could be very good. And I had trouble swallowing the concept of participating in something as heinously named as NaNoWriMo.",

Asking him to do stand-up badly would be like asking a master carpenter to make a chair badly. The work, after all those years, comes so naturally that doing it wrong would actually be harder. In his new stand-up special, Adam Sandler: Love You, it’s there in the title, that kind of glib “of course” quality—the dismissive way you say “love you” to a parent is the way you say it to Adam Sandler. Like, come on, of course.\nAt a breezy one hour and 14 minutes, Love You is directed by Josh Safdie, the same guy who co-directed Sandler in Uncut Gems, and it opens with the same blue-lit, rain-drenched noir grit Safdie’s so good at coughing up, though perhaps this one rides less on frenetic anxiety than bustle. Nicolette Larson croons her 1978 hit “Lotta Love,” as Sandler, in full beard and sweats, appears behind a cracked windshield, driving up to an alley full of autograph seekers and entering a dive of a venue crowded with people with too many demands and too little time to have them honored (you might recognize a few of the non-actors Safdie used in Gems here). Various elements of the stage are falling apart, the monitors don’t work, and a dog shows up at one point—it’s a mess. It’s a cute contradictory conceit, the image of a journeyman comedian who is still willing to play a shithole (“Who booked this place?”) for the love of it, reminiscent of Sandler’s lifelong swindler in Gems. Except this is also one of the most famous comedians in the world worth many multiple millions—he’s signing Happy Gilmore jerseys backstage in this, his second Netflix special—no one would dare give this guy the wrong sweetener unless it was scripted.",

The Baltimore Ravens have 16 more games to prove their worth while those Brooklyn Nets went right to powersuck in a heartbeat, and by extension the Ravens could still affirm Lamar Jackson's place somewhere near the top of the universe. Observing the NFL has been reduced by its simpleton punditocracy to quarterbacks plus some other stuff, because the game itself is apparently too involved to make us think about more than just the one position. Every now and then, though, a big tight end’s big toe can be momentarily significant.\nThe NFL’s rolling Chief Show was not what the audience wanted from Thursday night's season opener. It wanted Likely to have both feet fully inside the white paint so that the compelling game everyone received could go on a little bit longer. Probably not that much longer—even in that universe where Likely, the Ravens' Kelce-in-training, gets credit for the touchdown he surely had scored, the Ravens probably push it all in on a two-point conversion try that either wins or loses the game. That would have been an act of starkest clarity that made people think more fondly of Ravens head coach John Harbaugh, but it is also academic. The good news was that last night’s game was so compelling that we would have signed up for 10 more minutes of it. The bad news was that it ended in anticlimax. Likely's toe was a quarter-inch too prominent and so a spectacular denouement shriveled to referee Shaun Hochuli declaring that Likely's heroics weren't heroics at all, and that everyone would have to clear the stadium and their living rooms. It was that rare case where virtually all of America’s unaffiliated millions of viewers would have preferred the incorrect call.",

          "description": "On Thursday, ESPN announced that it will expand its coverage of the National Women's Soccer League and the Premier Lacrosse League, a move meant to \"enhance coverage of underserved sports.\" While nothing a company like ESPN does is purely driven by altruistic motives, this is an overdue course correction from the most influential entity in sports journalism. Hiring more journalists to cover women's soccer and men's lacrosse is a big win for the sports and for readers, and ESPN should reap the benefits of increased reporting by—oh no oh god it's yet another bullshit AI pivot.\nRead that quote in the first paragraph again: ESPN wants to \"enhance coverage of underserved sports,\" but is not going to pay real human beings to do this. Instead, it will \"leverage Microsoft AI technology\" to autogenerate game recaps. But don't worry, a human editor will be on hand to check each recap for \"quality and accuracy,\" because at least the brass at ESPN knows the slop AI is best known for producing. As an example: In the original tweet from ESPN Front Row, the AI-generated recap meant to showcase the feature got the Washington Spirit's record wrong. The company deleted the tweet and reposted it with a different blurb.",

          "description": "The concrete crypt that is baseball in Oakland still offers some appeal, although the experience is most likely to charm someone who is either too true a believer to know better or who had never previously experienced the magic of the Coliseum's Kremlin-style architecture. Thus the news that our much beloved Comrade Anantharaman was making her first trip to what the locals used to call \"the Mausoleum\" inspired us to try and capture the moments of discovery that would flood her senses, and maybe also show her the toe to which the game has tied its coroner's tag.\nFortunately for her, Comrade Redford was part of the traveling party as well, which left two people who see the good in others and their surroundings to steel themselves against the scheduled indignities of Mariners-A's on a Wednesday night in September when the Mariners are barely in the wild card race and the A's are already sewing \"West Sacramento\" on their baseball underpants. The comrades would have fun if they had to dig beneath the asphalt to find it; Comrade Anantharaman wanted to experience Oakland baseball as part of what is apparently a very long baseball bucket list, and Comrade Redford just has a good attitude in general.",
