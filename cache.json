The country that cares most about hockey won, the game's most recognizable player, Connor McDavid, scored the winning goal, the game's disputably best player, Nathan MacKinnon, was named the most valuable player, and the goaltender who stole the show, Jordan Binnington, fully resuscitated the reputation as a big-game player he last enjoyed six years ago.",

The U.S. is, perhaps, in the process of losing its unquestioned position as the supreme basketballing nation. Canada, not for the first time and certainly not the last, faces a reckoning with its place in the hockey world. Since the fall of the U.S.S.R., the top of the sport has become more European, increasingly global, and, above all else, creepingly American. A smaller percentage of NHL players are from Canada than ever before, and more of the best players are from the U.S., as the league has expanded below the border and contracted above it. It's a numbers game, and if it isn't reflected in relative culture cachet, it'll become apparent by who raises the trophies in international competition. Canada may well lose its iron grip on hockey—but not yet.\nTeam Canada re-expressed its dominion with a 3-2 overtime win over the U.S. in the final of the 4 Nations Face-Off, a totally made-up all-star replacement that almost accidentally stumbled its way into becoming a geopolitical referendum, and served as emphatic notice that the sport is still Canada's to lose. I won't drag out this blog before giving you the climactic goal, the one that'll be replayed for years and years. And because the champions wear red maple leaves, you get the Chris Cuthbert call:",

          "description": "It's hard to know whether or not Bayern Munich is particularly good this season. On one hand, they have the best stats in Europe. Die Roten score more domestic goals than anyone in the Old Continent's top-five leagues, and allow among the fewest. Even in the Champions League, where their underwhelming results consigned them to the funky but fun new format's purgatory round, the Germans could point to their competition-best expected goal difference as evidence that their performances have been better than the scoreboards might indicate. And just in terms of pure talent, Bayern doesn't have to look at any other team's roster with envy. By all accounts, this should be one of the best teams in the world.\nOn the other hand, Bayern's cumulative showings across the season give off a strong whiff of a flat-track bully. Though they consistently hammer their lessers, Bayern's record against more or less equals isn't very good: four draws and no wins against Bayer Leverkusen (twice), Eintracht Frankfurt, and Borussia Dortmund in league play, a loss to Leverkusen that bounced them from the German Cup, and three Champions League defeats to Aston Villa, Barcelona, and Feyenoord by a combined score of 8-1. A 1-0 win over almost-didn't-even-make-it-to-purgatory Paris Saint-Germain and a 5-1 Bundesliga win over FC Lawn Ball Sports are the closest Bayern has come to statement victories this season.",

But before we could do that, Rohan asked why it is that we still feel compelled to do the sports talk at all when we could very easily justify doing an entire hour on foods we have enjoyed, with a couple Funbag questions stuck on at the end.

The Bucks have 29 games left in the regular season, so they will be without a critical player for an extremely important stretch run in which they will have to fight desperately to stay in front of, somehow, the Detroit Pistons. Portis, in turn, will lose $2.8 million in game checks, so everyone involved is screwed—all over what Portis's representatives are calling an accident involving a substance of questionable performance benefit.\nAs Portis's agent Mark Bartlestein detailed to ESPN's Shams Charania, Portis takes the very similarly named Toradol to manage pain and inflammation from an elbow contusion he picked up at the start of the season, which explains the mixup. \"The tramadol pill he took came from an assistant of his, with a valid prescription for the painkiller, which he mistakenly told Bobby was Toradol,\" said Bartlestein. Portis does not plan to appeal the suspension.",

I tabbed over to their pages, knowing I would not see anything profound or overwhelming, merely the mundane thoughts they'd had in 2013, 2017, or 2024, preserved in amber as long as the platform clings to life. The contrast between ephemerality and permanence was jarring. I didn't know whether it felt more respectful to continue following them or let them go.\nThis precise, hypermodern dissonance is one of the subjects of Jeremy Gordon's forthcoming novel, See Friendship. Gordon's book tells the story of Jacob, a somewhat adrift digital-media drone who needs to create something substantial to keep his career going. Once he learns that a close high school friend named Seth did not die in his sleep as he was told, but under stranger and more tragic circumstances, he decides to create a narrative podcast investigating the death.",

Judge José Manuel Fernández-Prieto found Rubiales guilty of the assault charge, but acquitted him of an accompanying charge of coercion concerning his subsequent efforts at pressuring Hermoso into supporting him and downplaying the incident.\nAlthough the prosecution had asked for a prison sentence of one year for the sexual assault charge (and a further 18 months for the coercion), the court opted to impose a fine instead: €20 per day over 18 months, €10,800 in total. Rubiales is also forbidden from contacting Hermoso or coming within 200 meters of her for one year. Also acquitted of coercion were Rubiales's fellow defendants on that charge, former women's national team coach Jorge Vilda and former federation executives Albert Luque and Rubén Rivera.",

          "description": "The “black box” in the title of Shiori Itō’s documentary Black Box Diaries, in which the journalist investigates her own sexual assault, essentially refers to the excuse Japan gives for not properly investigating rape cases. “Because it’s in a black box, we’ll never really know what happened,” is what Itō was told, and as she says in the film, “I think that tells everything about our justice system.” But the black box works as a loose metaphor for another kind of unknowability that permeates the documentary, which was recently nominated for an Academy Award and is made up largely of personal video diaries, sound recordings, and a fly-on-the wall footage of the filmmaker as she investigates her case and ultimately writes a memoir about it (Black Box, 2017). Itō explains a few times that her way of surviving is to wrap herself up in work, to treat her case as a journalist would. But in the midst of this singular focus, the filmmaker in a sense puts herself—that is, Itō the survivor—in a black box. In the midst of this grand investigation, she herself remains unexamined. “I realized I haven’t faced myself,” she says at one point. The tension between the two sides of her—Itō the journalist and Itō the survivor—makes Black Box Diaries a kind of stealth dual narrative, one in which it becomes clear that a guilty verdict is not the end, not even close.\nThe film starts with a trigger warning, and I will defer to it here. Itō’s documentary opens with cherry blossom petals floating along the water beneath a script warning of the content and offering up how she has dealt with triggers in the past: by closing her eyes, by taking a deep breath. The flowers seem like just a pretty aesthetic choice at first, but by the end of the film you learn that these petals themselves became a trigger for Itō, and only later did she realize it was because the crime took place during cherry blossom season.",

In Dawson, the main townsite sits on one side of the water, but the teams take their mandatory midpoint layover in a public campground on the other. For many years, an ice bridge has been built to connect the two sides—the main town and its more remote west-side suburbs—robust enough for even heavy vehicle traffic. During my coverage of the 2012 and 2013 Quests, I had always driven onto the ice bridge from the sloping boat ramp where a ferry docks in summer. That night in 2014, I did the same. It was very dark, and very, very cold.\nI’d befriended a photographer from New York who was in town to cover the race, and she was in my passenger seat as I rolled us out onto the ice. We were partway across when I spotted an irregularity, a patch of darkness that resisted the light of my headlights. There was, I realized, open water lurking not all that far ahead of me. I tried not to panic, tried not to let on that we were both possibly about to die. Holding my breath, I put the Jeep into reverse, and eased back along my own tire tracks until we were on solid ground again. The next day, I learned that the bridge had been rerouted to cross farther upriver.",

          "description": "In a dream scenario for every ESPN producer, basketball-adjacent yapper, and SpringHill Company stakeholder, the Los Angeles Lakers will be the most fascinating team to watch during the NBA's sprint to the playoffs. It's not even close: No other team in the league so dramatically rejiggered itself at the trade deadline, to the point that the Luka Doncic trade feels categorically incomparable to the De'Aaron Fox or Jimmy Butler trades. The Lakers are fifth in the Western Conference at the moment, uncomfortably equipoised between second and eighth, leaving them very little latitude in figuring out how to get their two superstars, who are 15 years apart in age, on the same page.\nMost intriguing of all, they have to do it with a hilariously unbalanced team. Days after snagging Doncic, L.A. agreed to trade a cache of future assets for permanently mangled Charlotte Hornets center Mark Williams—only to get him in for a physical and learn that there was apparently a compelling medical reason that he had played only 85 games in three seasons. Whatever the Lakers braintrust saw was bad enough that it compelled them to rescind the trade, which is a huge bummer for Williams and will probably cost him millions of dollars, and leaves the Lakers with a half-formed roster, without a functional two-way big. This is what makes them so fascinating. They have to try and win big, capitalizing on what's turning into a great LeBron campaign, with a totally compromised squad. The Lakers did not intend to have their season serve as evidence in the ongoing trial of whether or not big men have a place in the NBA, though that's now their burden.",

While Shohei Ohtani was spiritually throwing fourteen pitches in a Dodgers uniform, the Phillies first full squad workout took place without Bryce Harper and Aaron Nola, who were out with food poisoning, and Trea Turner, who was out with a new baby.\nThe absence of Harper and, by extension, Nola, would not have been particularly notable if not for Harper's new TikTok content, in which he revealed, in an iced vanilla latte–making video, that he and his family preferred drinking raw milk—though in the video he used Maple Hill, which is not only pasteurized but ultra-pasteurized. Here is a series of possibly unrelated facts. Pasteurization is the simple process of treating food products to mild heat in order to neutralize microorganisms and enzymes that cause disease. Raw milk accordingly comes with an increased risk of carrying germs like E. coli and Salmonella. Aaron Nola, who is TikTok-less, has yet to go on record declaring his allegiance, or lack thereof, to raw milk. The actual cause of Harper and Nola's food poisoning is unknown. Harper's TikTok also revealed a knowledge of an involved matcha-making process complete with sieve and whisk.",

This has as much to do with nationalism as it does with the belief that hockey has figured out the all-star weekend conundrum that basketball has mangled, but you take it the way it hits you.\nAnd let's downplay the nationalism part. Thursday's show almost has to begin with a line brawl during the Canadian national anthem, because that is precisely the bar the two teams set for themselves when they played on Saturday. Nothing sells these days quite like jingoism, the U.S. is back to treating Canada like the unnamed 14th colony, and well, there are going to be Tkachuks on the ice. The hockey could be brilliant on Thursday; it very well might be since most of the world's best players this time around are Canadians or Americans. But Saturday also gave us three serious fights in the game's first nine seconds, which got the attention of even hockey arrivistes.",

It's a perfect storm: the 4 Nations Face-Off going far beyond expectations, the U.S. and Canada engaged in uncustomary and very stupid geopolitical beef, the NBA having existential conniptions over its disastrous all-star game. The numbers back up the anecdotal evidence that casual fans are paying attention to the tournament in a way they haven't acknowledged hockey in years; I've been hearing from non-fan friends about that bellicose USA-Canada game this weekend. With this wider attention inevitably comes getting caught up in the culture wars. Pick your poison—hockey can be used to support any pet take, no matter how deluded or xenophobic. It's enough to invert the classic plea: Please don't like my sport. \nBut that's the price of popularity. And if Thursday night's U.S. vs. Canada winner-take-all final of the first best-on-best tournament in a decade attracts some of the \"wrong\" type of audience members, that's not my problem, or yours. We get to enjoy two incredible hockey teams who genuinely dislike each other settling things on the ice. Nothing but pride and bragging rights will actually be on the line, and that's more than enough.",

          "description": "The most puzzling part of the Jannik Sinner's doping saga might be its conclusion. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) announced over the weekend that it had reached a settlement with the top-ranked player in men's tennis. WADA would no longer be moving forward with its appeal of a previous \"no fault or negligence\" ruling reached by a tennis-specific anti-doping authority, which, had it been successful, could have carried a ban of one to two years. Instead, WADA and Sinner agreed to a settlement: He would accept a three-month suspension, starting Feb. 9 to May 4, a span in which he would miss no major tournaments on the tour.\nThere has been a lot of conspiratorial chatter about this case, much of it from fellow players, much of it wildly ill-informed (with one exception). I had my own narrower misgivings. Sinner's story involved a somewhat convoluted series of mishaps: His trainer supplied a physiotherapist with an over-the-counter topical clostebol spray for a finger cut, then said spray got into Sinner's body when the physio massaged the player's sore-covered dermatitic skin. That was meant to explain how metabolites of clostebol were detected in two samples collected from Sinner eight days apart last March. But how could experienced staffers whose critical job function was to keep prohibited substances out of their employer's body do something this careless? Why would clostebol spray ever be in the vicinity of a work trip? Why were those staffers retained for months after this catastrophic error?",

          "description": "The Toronto Sceptres learned the hard way last year that it’s risky to lean too hard on one star, even when the star's up to the task. When Natalie Spooner tore her ACL in the third game of the semifinal round of the PWHL playoffs in May, the Sceptres lost a league-leading goalscorer and pretty much their entire offense, too. Toronto scored just one goal in the final three games of that series. The injury cut short their inaugural season, and complicated their next one: The Sceptres would have to replace an MVP’s production for as long as it took Spooner to get back. Could they make it work?\nNo, the first few games suggested. Behind a shaky defense, Kristen Campbell, the league’s top goalie last year, struggled to start the season. The team clearly missed Spooner’s net-front presence and the high-percentage shots she generated with her size and quick hands. But things took an encouraging turn in late January, when the last-place Sceptres began to lose in shootouts instead of in regulation. Suddenly, they were putting together a point streak. Soon, the point streak became a win streak. With a 3-2 overtime win against Ottawa on Sunday, Toronto’s fourth straight, the Sceptres moved into second place in the PWHL standings, only behind juggernaut Montreal.",

It will probably take yet another major offseason overhaul for United to even start to address its problems. None of this is breaking news, but what is legitimately stunning is how the Red Devils keep contriving to make a bad situation—one entirely of the club's own making—even worse.\nOn Sunday, Manchester United traveled to North London to face Tottenham, another so-called Big Six team that is in moderate-to-severe crisis. Aside from their positions on the table—much lower than either expected—there are not many similarities between Tottenham and United. The former is an injury-ridden mess that beats itself more often than not, while the latter is by almost every metric a middling team that plays even worse than that due to something unquantifiable: a rancid air of stagnation that has seeped into every pore of the once-vaunted club.",

Ricky Jay and His 52 Assistants was incredibly funny, but Jay was a magician, although that seems not quite right. The press material for the special, which first aired on December 17, 1996, called him an “illusionist.” That feels closer, but still not quite sufficient. The special, which was directed by Jay’s regular collaborator David Mamet, combined a number of astonishing card tricks with a breezily thorough recounting of the history of magic. That was more or less Ricky Jay's act; no one else has ever really done anything like it.\nRicky Jay, who died in 2018 at the age of 72, combined mastery of his craft with a thorough knowledge of its culture and lore. His 52 Assistants special was notable for his ability to throw playing cards into a watermelon and also his skill at explaining the long history of the cups and balls trick. You probably don’t need to be told not to get tricked into playing that by a hustler on the subway; Jay walks his audience through the long history of that hustle.",

NBA tip-off times are notoriously far afield of what is promised by TV listings, and I wasn't eager to spend any more time than was absolutely necessary watching pregame ceremonies, or listening to Kevin Hart talk. 8:30 ET seemed like a good time to tune in, even if it meant I might end up missing the first few minutes of the first game. When the TV flicked on, that game hadn't started yet, and Kevin Hart was screaming at me.\nThis was supposed to be the All-Star Game that got things back on track, whatever that means. Commissioner Adam Silver, who never misses an opportunity to bemoan the lack of effort and attention given to the All-Star Game by the players, unveiled a new format that was meant to force a little competitive spirit into the game. Instead of one normal game—between East and West, or Americans and internationals, or Team LeBron and Team Ghost Of Kobe Bryant—we were treated to three mini-games that would make up a tournament. Three separate teams of all-stars, selected by Shaquille O'Neal, Candace Parker, and Kenny Smith, were thrown into a bracket with the Rising Stars team. The winners of the two semifinal games, played to 40 points, advanced to the final, also played to 40 points.",

In between learning about his pioneering BASIC coding language, I struggled to grasp what Laura Dern was saying in Inland Empire. In many respects, the two couldn’t be more different, but in some ways they act as mirrors—two lives that could have reversed with just a few small tweaks. Both were strongly identified with the West Coast: Gates in Seattle, Lynch in foresty Washington and then Los Angeles. Both held singular visions in their respective fields. One man pursued his passion with antisocial intensity, the other became the subject of clip compilations like “David Lynch melting my heart for three minutes straight.” One has spread software we use day in and day out, the other masterminded some of the most beguiling cinema ever produced. And now, Gates, one of the world’s richest men, has delivered one of its most pointless memoirs.\nBill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, served as the company’s CEO and largest shareholder until 2014. He founded the philanthropic Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with his now ex-wife, and his net worth hovers in the hundreds of billions. Along the way, he’s been accused of bullying, anti-competitive business tactics, and even spending too much time with noted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. When the tech tycoon came out swinging for vaccine patents in 2021, The New Republic called him a “monster.” But as he continues to fight climate change and Covid misinformation, a memoir offers a perfect opportunity to try to boost his spiraling reputation by reflecting on his earlier, more innocent childhood idylls.",

Now and then there might be a drunken scuffle in the alley outside, but the interior courtyard was never troubled by anything worse than grimy stray cats. Daily life was peaceful and secure.

          "description": "Last month the Baltimore Banner reported on allegations against Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, made by six women who had worked as massage therapists in the Baltimore area between 2012 and 2016. They each described having similar experiences while massaging Tucker, which included Tucker moving the sheet during the session to expose his erect penis, brushing his penis against their bodies, and leaving what appeared to be ejaculate on the massage table. The Banner has since published two follow-up reports in which more massage therapists say they experienced similar misconduct while massaging Tucker, bringing the total number of women to have come forward to 16.\nThe latest report, published Sunday, concerns allegations made by seven massage therapists. These women say they also had sessions with Tucker between 2012 and 2016 at various spas around the Baltimore area. Each of them described versions of the same experience: Tucker's erect penis was visible under the sheet when the session started, and he repeatedly attempted to remove the sheet. One woman said Tucker brushed her thighs with his fingers during the session, and another said he left what appeared to be ejaculate on the massage table when he left, which is something that several women in the Banner's first story reported seeing.",
