Watson and Ozy Media were both convicted in July of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. \nLast year Watson was indicted after New York Times reporting revealed that former Ozy Media Chief Operating Officer Samir Rao impersonated a YouTube executive on a conference call with Goldman Sachs. Both Watson and Ozy were indicted, and both pleaded not guilty throughout the trial, with Watson claiming instead that the entire trial was racially motivated, biased, and corrupt. He and his team raised more than $60,000 since March 2023 on this argument through a website titled “Too Black for Business,” and last month, supporters released a two-part, three-hour docuseries on YouTube called “The Troubling Case of Carlos Watson.”",

          "description": "The Charlotte Hornets scheduled a Christmas-themed on-court skit for a break in the second quarter of their home loss Monday to the depleted 76ers. The setup involved Hugo, the mascot of the Hornets, learning what a couple of participating children most want for Christmas, and then delivering the goods. The payoff, as far as I can tell, was supposed to come with the final wish: A kid tells Hugo, sadly, that his father is moving the family to Philadelphia, and Hugo saves the day by producing a new father, clad in a Hornets jersey, to keep the family in Charlotte. You're rolling your eyes now, but someone at the Hallmark Channel is rubbing their hands together greedily while their assistant speed-dials Luke Macfarlane.\nTo set up this joke, the skit had to first demonstrate that Hugo had Santa-like powers. The second and penultimate child to interact with Hugo, a 13-year-old named Jack, asked for and received a Playstation 5. In the same way that the children in the punchline did not get to keep the actor in the Hornets jersey, Jack was never intended to keep the Playstation 5; the expensive hardware was meant to establish Hugo's generosity, in order to set up the gag about how a Hornets-loving dad, to replace your regular, crappy one, would a great and wonderful gift. The Hornets were giving the gift of entertainment, to the audience, with a skit! They were not giving a PS5 to a child. Alexei Phillips, Jack's uncle, told Queen City News that after the skit the Hornets took back the PS5, and instead gave his nephew a Hornets jersey.",

Not Oscar season, but rather that stretch when the halls of streaming services are decked with the brightly lit, thinly disguised advertisements that are the year's new Christmas movies. There are more than 100 new Christmas films to watch this holiday season, and whether that number horrifies or excites you depends upon how much of a freak you are for the festive. Sabrina is proud to say they are a real Christmas freak, and this year they asked some of their colleagues to watch some of the most, uh, available new holiday movies. The fifth movie in our lineup is The Christmas Quest, a movie that pushes the boundary of what a neckline can be.\nSabrina Imbler: I’m so excited to talk with both of you about Hallmark’s first and potentially last foray into the special kind of love that stems from a mutual interest in Icelandic antiquities. Before we talk about the movie, I would love to learn more about your relationship with archaeology and the rich cultural traditions of Iceland.

Marshall, which won its first title in the 2020 season as an unseeded team, was the 13th seed this year and reached the final by defeating the No. 1 Ohio State. Meanwhile, unseeded Vermont beat two-seed Pitt and three-seed Denver on its way to the title game. The Thundering Herd and Catamounts put together a real thriller Monday night, as Vermont won its first championship in program history on a sudden-death goal in overtime.\nThat goal is at the 7:56 mark of the highlight reel below, though the entire second half of the match was very dramatic. Marshall took a 1-0 lead in the 57th minute after Vermont keeper Niklas Herceg mishandled a tough cross right into the path of Tarik Pannholzer. Herceg kept his team in it with a beautiful save minutes later, and in the 81st minute, Marcell Papp took advantage of a poor clearance from Marshall keeper Aleksa Janjic to start and finish a one-two with a shot from just inside the box. You're here for the winner, though. In overtime, centerback Zach Barrett intercepted a pass in the Vermont half and smacked a speculative longball for Maximilian Kissel. The forward shrugged off his defender, then dribbled around Janjic and scored.",

          "description": "Emma Chamberlain's most recent YouTube video opens with a montage of archival clips of her trying on outfits, shopping, and then purging her clothes over the years. Despite having, in her estimation, thousands of articles of clothing, Chamberlain says she was never satisfied. Instead, once she had accumulated what she decided were too many clothes, she would do a massive purge of her closet—only to fill it back up again. It's an interminable cycle: Buying a new thing is the answer to your emotional issue du jour, that is until you've unintentionally filled your home with too many things, at which point the only thing you can do to feel better is to purge. \nOnce Chamberlain had ruthlessly evaluated each of the pieces in her closet, what she was left with, to her surprise, was a sort of capsule wardrobe, a deliberately small, curated collection of clothing intended to be worn interchangeably. That Chamberlain, uber-influencer and proprietor of a 12 million–follower YouTube channel, has gone capsule is indicative of the sustaining appeal of the concept, and I believe indicates an attempt to exert aesthetic control in a time of marked economic and social instability.",

          "description": "So far, the person who killed United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson seems to have gotten what he wanted. It has been 13 days since Thompson was gunned down on a Manhattan street, and at this point the murder has been rather comfortably situated as an act of political violence. Authorities have charged a man named Luigi Mangione with the crime, and if a note he was carrying with him at the time of his arrest is to be believed, Thompson was killed as a response to the cruelty and depravity of the American healthcare industry, which has since become an urgent topic of conversation in American media and culture.\nEvidence of the killer’s victory can be found on any news channel, or in any number of mainstream publications. There was a brief period of time when one could get away with dismissing the enthusiasm that swelled around Mangione’s alleged act as something that only existed in the unreality of the internet—the byproduct of a small, irony-poisoned segment of the country that best understands how to use social media as a megaphone. If that enthusiasm ever was contained, it has since escaped: SNL is now a safe place to joke about Thompson’s death, and respectable publications like The New Yorker and New York Magazine have acknowledged Mangione’s folk-hero status. The effectiveness of the killing can also be found in reactions from those in the government. New York Governor Kathy Hochul has convened a “safety summit” for New York CEOs, and Florida authorities charged a mother with making terroristic threats for saying “delay, deny, depose” (the words Mangione allegedly wrote on his shell casings) during a phone call with her insurance provider. Senator Elizabeth Warren evidently takes the groundswell of support for Mangione seriously enough to pander to those who sympathize with him. She recently went on TV to say, “Violence is never the answer … but you can only push people so far.”",

          "description": "The Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers appear to have refreshed their mojo. It was never far gone, although consecutive home-and-away losses to the Atlanta Hawks confer a soupçon of illegitimacy so long as the Hawks remain the only team in the NBA to have lost twice to the abominable three-win Washington Wizards. The Cavaliers appear to have recovered from the wobble, and this is all normal basketball business in November and December, but it's enough to say that the team regressed after the best start in franchise history. That was inevitable. The questions had to do with how far their form would dip—are they as capable of excruciating lows as they are of rarified highs—and where precisely they'd sit in the league hierarchy once they'd settled.\nThat is possibly the most hedged and evasive basketblog lede ever written about a team with just four losses a third of the way through an NBA regular season. Part of that, I swear, is an effort to contain my own excitement about this Cavaliers team. I find them very easy to like, notwithstanding the few minutes every game that Donovan Mitchell spends waving his personal stamp around like a crazed mail clerk. Monday night they beat the absolute hell out of the Brooklyn Nets, recovering from a quick opening deficit with a vicious 16–0 run and then pouring it on, so that the final 39 minutes or so of a 48-minute contest were treated like an exhibition. Cleveland's scoring efficiency was downright unreasonable: The four starters not named Donovan Mitchell combined for 56 points and missed just five total shots and one free throw between them. Caris LeVert and Georges Niang drilled 8 of 14 three-point attempts off the bench. Without anyone even having a standout performance, the Cavs breezed to 130 points, and only Darius Garland kicking the ball around uncharacteristically and Sam Merrill forgetting how to shoot prevented them from sniffing 150.",

          "description": "Welcome to Meet Our Little Neighbors, an occasional series about the little guys who live among and around us, but rarely get the attention they deserve.\nRecently when a fly barged into my home, uninvited, I left them alone. I was feeling magnanimous and in need of some good karma. Perhaps, I reasoned, the mercy I showed this fly would return to me tenfold on some later date. I watched the fly zig-zag down my hallways and felt smugly philanthropic. How many flies got to live out the rest of their limited days on Earth in a habitat as temperate and well-attended as my pre-war apartment? Its constant buzzing, especially near my face, was annoying, and a part of me blanched each time my eyes strayed from my food, opening up the possibility for the fly to regurgitate its fly juice on my avocado toast. But these were all small, tolerable, annoyances, I reasoned. How long could a fly possibly live?",

          "description": "Six months out, the 2025 NBA Draft is primarily conceived of and talked about as the Cooper Flagg draft. This makes a certain degree of sense, as Flagg is a huge destroyer who has been kicking ass for Duke and looking every bit like the sort of prospect who could push NBA defense forward, someone without precedent (in draftese, he's been \"demonstrating the myriad ways he affects winning.\") But you don't need to be a basketball alien to be cool. Dylan Harper is a hyperskilled operator, the man widely projected to be selected one pick after Flagg, and the most magnetic player in college basketball.\nWhere Flagg is a somewhat idiosyncratic player, causing open confusion among NBA execs, there's zero uncertainty about the sort of professional Harper will be. He is the consummate modern point guard, someone who looks like he is playing at a pro level already. I don't really understand how college defenders are supposed to guard someone who is 6-foot-6 with a plus-four wingspan and this advanced of a ball-handler with both hands. Harper is the ideal driver, gliding both past and through defenders, who always appear to be flailing like used-car inflatable dancing guys in contrast to Harper's perfect balance. He's also shooting 36 percent from three—not an eye-popping number, but his mechanics are clean, not to mention beautiful, and that figure includes a ton of self-created step-back stuff and his recent hot stretch of 46 percent over the past four games. Harper had his big moment this past weekend, when he nailed a buzzer-beating three to down Seton Hall in an extremely competitive game.",

While it remains impossible to rebuild Juan Soto in the aggregate, \"Now we can afford to sign multiple guys\" is at least starting to pan out as true, if not necessarily in the hitting department. Of course, this blog is not about Juan Soto.\nLast week, the Yankees signed free agent Max Fried to an eight-year, $218 million contract. This at least covered the record-breaking portion of rebuilding Soto's contract in the aggregate, though instead of the more straightforward \"biggest contract in MLB history,\" it came with the qualifiers of being the largest guarantee for a left-handed pitcher. Also like Soto's contract, the contract has a large risk of being player-friendly toward the end—Soto will be 41 when his runs out; Fried is currently 30 with a spotty injury history—but the Yankees front office, like the Mets', will only cry about the final years if the team doesn't make some deep runs in the first few.",

They sit atop the AFC with the best record in football; they are an unstoppable juggernaut, if you just look at their record.\nBut nobody is just looking at their record. Injuries, a lack of depth, a weak offensive line, and an uncharacteristically flat offense have all combined to make this one of the least-impressive one-loss teams in memory. But wins are all that matters, and when the playoffs start the most important thing for the Chiefs will be that they have the best quarterback in football, who has found a way to win when it counts, even when it requires a little demon magic along the way. Everyone has been waiting for this football team to finally implode, but it hasn't happened yet, and they still have Patrick Mahomes.",

It has all the elements we think we deserve—points, absurd plays, points, easily caricatured main characters, points, long-to-the-point-of-seemingly-interminable-suffering fan bases, points, a coach who wants all his linemen to have touchdowns, more points, another coach who has been slagged repeatedly for not reaching let alone winning the big one, additional points, the MVP and the Coach Of The Year if you're into that sort of thing, further points, towns that fight the odds just by getting out of bed every day, another round of points, drunks jumping through furniture, and one final round of points.\nNow comes the hard part, which is coming to grips with the likelihood that we likely won't get Bills-Lions again, and having the fortitude and dignity to refuse to watch whatever matchup the National Football League tries to pretend we'd rather have instead. In other words, if it ain't Bills-Lions, we must cancel the parties, refuse to get dressed on game day, and hate-watch the Puppy Bowl instead. If we can't get it together to do the right thing in November, we may as well give it an honest go in February.",

Yes, it will be nominated for, and perhaps win, a whole shitload of Oscars. And yes, DOP Stephane Fontaine’s camerawork deserves one of those Oscars. If you want two hours of sumptuous Vatican porn (and the mood strikes me more often than you’d imagine), Fontaine and director Edward Berger deliver a movie with multiple frames that are literally suitable for framing. Put those shots in a fucking museum.\nBut that ain’t what anyone’s gonna talk about coming out of the theater. What everyone is gonna talk about is, “Oh wow, can you believe that ending?” And if you haven’t seen it Conclave yet, you’ll be besieged by satisfied customers encouraging you to experience its endgame for yourself. We’re still in the Spoiler Zone for this film, so I can’t and won't talk more about how Conclave’s plot resolves itself.

          "description": "There's a kind of hush that is specific to old-growth suburbs, a quietness that is more vast and more inherent than any disturbance that kind of place can kick up. The place where I grew up is different in some ways than it was when I was growing up there, but that fundamental quiet is undisturbed. Things happen and make their various sounds—you'll hear a quick blurt of music when someone steps out of a bar to smoke or as people come and go from one of the restaurants downtown, cars go by and dogs get bossy on their walks and freight trains chug and honk over the New Jersey Transit lines when the commuter trains aren't running. People still live there, and people make noise. The part that is striking, and which is striking to me whenever I go back to see my parents in the house where I grew up, is how the totality of that suburban quiet swallows all this up. It's there and then it is gone, and there is maybe the wind in the trees or just nothing at all.\nI have lived in noisy places for longer than I ever lived in all that quiet, but the appeal of it isn't lost on me. I like how dark it gets at night there, and I like walking back from the train station down those quiet sidewalks and through all the old extraneous shortcuts of my youth. The last few times I've done this I have startled some deer standing around in a parking lot, as aimless and wary as I was when I did the same thing as a teenager; they stared at me but did not run. I am aware that it is a nice place to live and it was on balance a perfectly fine place to grow up. I understand why people live there. I am also under no illusions about how quickly and how thoroughly I would go insane if I were to try to do it again.",

          "description": "Through the city of Sendai runs the Hirose River. It has several stream pools along its course, one of which is known as Kashikobuchi, or the Wise Abyss, and there is a chilling legend that accounts for its name.\n\r\nOnce upon a time, a local man was fishing by this stream pool when he found a gossamer thread tied around his ankle. Finding it strange, the man undid it and instead tied it around the trunk of a nearby willow tree. The same thing happened over and over again, until the tree got dragged into the water with a loud noise. Dumbfounded, the man stood there watching the ripples spread on the surface of the river.\n\r\nOut of the silence that followed, an ominous voice was heard saying \"Kashikoi, kashikoi \"(Very wise, very wise). Then the man finally saw what lurked underneath the water: a monstrous spider that reigned over the area, preying on unsuspecting villagers.\n\r\nInterestingly, the same spider makes an appearance in another folk tale of Sendai. In this legend, a large eel that lived in the downstream called on another villager to aid him in a fight with the spider, asking him to stand by as a witness and not to make a sound. The next evening, the villager came to see the eel and the spider fighting, and could not help but scream in terror. This caused the eel to lose the battle, and all the villager saw was its severed head glaring at him from the water, before losing his mind and dying.\n\r\nThe Spider of Kashikobuchi was both feared and worshipped by the villagers, who regarded him as a god of trade and protector against floods. Today, a largely neglected stele in the thicket by National Route 48—overlooking the Kashikobuchi pool, no less—serves as the only testament to this spider god, here referred to as Myōhō-gumo-no-rei, or the Ghost of the Mystic Spider.",

          "description": "Masumoto Family Farm is a fourth-generation Japanese-American farm outside of Fresno, California, run by David “Mas” Masumoto and his daughter, Nikiko. The family focuses on growing heirloom stone fruits and grapes, steered by their belief that, above all else, fruit should taste amazing. That seems like an obvious goal, but in the modern market, durability and appearance have long trumped flavor in the produce aisles. So by growing delicious heirloom varieties, the Masumotos are making a radical choice. And with no guaranteed commercial buyers, they often have to rely on equally radical systems to sell their fruit. That’s why, 20 years ago, Mas decided to tread new ground to save the Elberta peach—an almost-extinct heirloom stone fruit—by creating his Adopt-a-Tree Program.\n\r\nWhen I first …",

          "description": "This museum's primary focus is on musical instruments that represent the diverse musical traditions of Morocco and the surrounding region. Visitors can examine a comprehensive collection of musical instruments from various ethnic and cultural groups. The displays provide context about the historical significance, construction techniques, and cultural importance of these musical artifacts.\n\r\nTraditional Moroccan music is classified by its kaleidoscopic regional variations. Among the most common styles are Amazigh, Andalusi, malhun, chaabi, aita, reggada, gnawa, and guedra. Each of these styles is associated with specific ethnic groups and musical instruments. Made of locally available resources and at times with hard-to-come-by materials, these instruments required is astonishing level of artisanship.  \n\r\nArchitecturally, the museum preserves the splendor of a traditional Moroccan palace, with its beautiful inner courtyard and elaborately decorated rooms serving as an exceptional setting for the musical instrument exhibits. The space itself tells a story of cultural refinement, with each room carefully designed to complement the musical displays and provide visitors with an immersive experience of Morocco's musical heritage.\n\r\nAn inscription unearthed in the reception room attests that the building was constructed in 1882. The original owner of this palace was Ben Larbi Jamai, Grand Vizier of Sultan Moulay Hassan I. In 1912, the French authorities repurposed this building to serve as a military hospital, and a few years later, in 1920, the palace was officially recognized as a historical monument. The same year, the Museum of Indigenous Arts was opened on its premises.  Since then, the theme of the museum has undergone several transformations, and in 2014, it eventually became the National Museum of Music.",

Historically, it flourished as a post station with a border checkpoint, situated on the road connecting Tokyo—then known as Edo—and Kyoto.\n\r\nThe 319-mile-long road was called the Tokaido or \"East Sea Road,\" a name which survives today as a bullet train line. The cobblestone pavements of the road have survived at three points: Kanaya, Kikukawa, and Hakone.\n\r\nThe Hakone portion of the Old Tokaido  Way was known as a perilous point back in the Edo period, a steep mountain pass often slippery with mud. Even after it was paved with stones around the 17th century, travelers are said to have had a hard time getting past the pass.\n\r\nIn 1618, the shogun’s government planted cedar trees along the road, 412 of which have survived to this day as a scenic lakeside avenue. The feudal-era atmosphere still hangs in the area, and walking on the cobblestone pavement in the woods will let you feel like a journeying samurai.",

          "description": "Since 2018, Christmas—or rather, XXXmas—has made a provocative, year-round statement in an Oslo traffic circle. At its center stands a 20-foot-tall (6-meter) figure, simply called Santa—a creation that has become both a curiosity and a controversy.\n\r\nThe striking red bronze sculpture, created by Los Angeles artist Paul McCarthy, has earned nicknames like the “Dildo Gnome” and “Santa with Butt Plug” because the object Santa holds—a Christmas tree—bears a suggestive resemblance to a sex toy. With exaggerated features and provocative humor, it’s impossible to miss.\n\r\nMcCarthy frames his work as a critique of Western consumerism and the holiday season’s excesses, blending high and low culture with playful irreverence. He notes that an innocent Christmas icon can carry distinctly adult undertones: while it might simply be a Christmas tree, it could also resemble a butt plug—redefining it as abstract art.\n\r\nPublic opinion in Oslo is divided: some see the statue as a tacky distraction, while others embrace its absurdity as a quirky addition to the cityscape. Even far-right organizations have voiced their disapproval, arguing that it undermines traditional values, sparking debates about artistic expression and cultural identity.\n\r\nChristian Ringnes, brewer heir and philanthropist, whose foundation funded the project, calls the statue a bold centerpiece for the area—an amusing, lively twist for an otherwise unremarkable spot. Ringnes admits he initially saw it as a jolly Santa Claus, only later recognizing its more provocative interpretations.\n\r\nOslo’s version, painted bright red and constructed from rough, horizontal slices, differs from the smooth, dark, unpainted original in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Planned for installation in 2001, the Dutch statue faced delays and was ultimately relocated a couple of times after intense backlash to its design.",

Originally a lantern festival, Nebuta has since developed into a parade involving huge papier-mâché floats that mainly portray kabuki actors, mythological figures, and folk heroes.\n\r\nFounded in 2011, the Nebuta Museum Wa Rasse exhibits such floats used in the most recent festival, celebrating this unique cultural event and archiving its history. The name was chosen as the winner of a public naming competition; rasse is based on rasse-ra, the typical heave-ho shout cried out by the float-haulers, while wa has several meanings in Japanese including \"harmony\" and \"circle.\" Together, the name is also meant to evoke the word warai, or \"laughter.\"\n\r\nLocated in the Aomori Waterfront area, the museum is only a short walk from the city’s central station. The building that houses the museum is an eye-catching sight, with red vertical louvers covering its exterior and giving its entrance a look like that of a steel curtain parting to welcome visitors.\n\r\nThe museum is a dark, spacious hall filled with colorful lights coming from the Nebuta floats, showcasing traditional artistry and folklore. The papier-mâché figures are astonishingly dynamic, with flowing hair and splashing water magically brought to life.",

They vary in temperature and the healing mineral they naturally contain, and have been enjoyed ever since Roman times.\n\r\nIn Gorna Banya, the water has been revered for its healing nature for centuries. According to local folk tales, the waters had restored the once-abandoned village and healed a hunting dog from the valley of Sofia.\n\r\nIn 1922, a modern bathhouse with separate bathing areas and medical facilities was built, replacing an old Ottoman building. The ornate brick structure was designed in a late Vienna Secession style, with reinforced concrete domes and stone statues.\n\r\nPublic bathing culture started to decline in the 1960s as bathrooms became commonplace in new buildings, and collapsed further after the fall of the communist regime, as government subsidies for public baths dried out, leaving all but a few profitable structures closed and abandoned. The Gorna Banya bath house was no exception.\n\r\nToday, the beautiful abandoned structure is a shadow of its former self. Yet contrary to most of its abandoned counterparts, it rarely falls completely silent. The water that once gave it life now flows freely right next to it, in a public fountain that attracts those who still seek the town's mineral-rich waters.",

          "description": "Located near Kilmartin in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, Poltalloch House is a significant 19th-century mansion now in ruins. Constructed between 1849 and 1853, the house was designed by William Burn, a prominent architect known for his work in the Scottish Baronial style. Built for the Malcolm family, who were influential landowners in the area, the mansion features characteristic elements of the style, including turrets, battlements, and crow-stepped gables.\n\r\nThe house's decline began during World War II when it was requisitioned by the military. The wartime use led to significant wear and tear. After the war, the high costs of maintenance and changing economic circumstances contributed to the mansion's abandonment in the mid-20th century. Over time, Poltalloch House fell into disrepair, with its roof collapsing and interior largely destroyed.\n\r\nToday, Poltalloch House stands as a ruin. While no full restoration has been undertaken, there have been efforts to stabilize the structure to prevent further deterioration. Despite its dilapidated state, the house remains an important example of William Burn’s architectural work and the Scottish Baronial style that was popular in the Victorian era. It is fascinating to view the way in which nature has taken over the ruins with many trees and vines running over the crumbling structures. The mansion and the surrounding estate are historically significant to the region, reflecting the social and economic history of Scotland’s aristocracy.",

In World War I, the Royal West African Frontier Force served in operations against German forces in then-Togoland. In World War II, the strategic location of the port of Freetown meant it was fortified and became a critical base for protecting sea routes to the Middle East, India, and Australasia.\n\r\nThe vast majority of these forces were native Africans, many of them Sierra Leonean. Sierra Leoneans served as soldiers in the Frontier Force, and an even larger number served in the Carrier Corps. Combat in the African interior relied on vast quantities of materiel, but a lack of roads and mechanization meant that often the only effective method of transport was on the heads of the Carrier Corps.\n\r\nSierra Leonean forces saw combat from East Africa to Italy, and faced a grim death toll. Besides death in combat, many hundreds died of sicknesses including dysentery, tuberculosis, and especially malaria. The Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery honors soldiers who died during service in World War II. The cemetery contains the graves of 70 West African and four British soldiers.",

          "description": "Barcelona is one of the most visited cities in the world—and given its abundance of urban beaches, cultural institutions, and striking Gaudí-designed masterpieces, justifiably so. But while the city is famous for its restaurants, much of what makes its cuisine so unique has been lost in the rush of international brands and blandly Spanish dining concepts meant to appeal to tourists and digital nomads.\n\r\nTo this day, Barcelona’s identity is tied to Catalonia, a semi-autonomous region with its own language, culture, anthem, and gastronomy. Despite being part of Spain for well over five centuries, Catalan people are still fiercely proud of their own distinct traditions. When it comes to the food, that means here you’ll encounter dishes combining meat and seafood (as well as meat and fruit) fo…",

          "description": "In Malmö harbor, a cone-shaped concrete relic of World War II-era architecture rises above the former dockyard like a giant vertical cigar: the Spetsbunker, a towering 60-foot (18-meter) bomb shelter. \n\r\nThe bunker’s construction around 1940 solved a significant challenge for the nearby then-bustling shipyard: the waterlogged, unstable ground made underground shelters impractical. Designed to protect up to 150 workers, the structure, however, ultimately went unused, as Sweden remained largely untouched by the war.\n\r\nWhile relatively common in wartime Germany, this type of above-ground bunker is believed to be the only one of its kind in Sweden. Drawing on the pioneering work of engineer Leo Winkel, known for creating Winkeltürme (“Winkel Towers”) or Spitzbunker (“Pointed Bunkers”), the structure embodies both functionality and creativity. \n\r\nThe air raid shelter’s tall, narrow, circular base, with a metal-reinforced pointed top, was crafted to be nearly invisible to enemy bombers and exceptionally difficult to destroy. Even a direct hit would cause the payload to glance off the surface, rather than penetrating the walls.\n\r\nOvergrown with vines, the Spetsbunker remains a stoic sentinel. Though closed to the public, its weathered interior features a spiral staircase, platforms, and a central shaft with a winch. Its distinctive silhouette continues to serve as both a historical landmark and a reminder of wartime innovation.",

          "description": "Nestled in central Morocco’s rugged landscapes, the Ahouli Mines have a rich history as a hub of mineral production. The French company Penarroya initiated the mining operations in 1927. From 1928 to the 1960s, these mines yielded tens of thousands of tons of lead annually, employing hundreds of workers who extracted resources from dynamite-blasted tunnels—an industrial technique now banned in Morocco.\n\r\nAt about 1.5 kilometers from the entrance, the main tunnel splits into two and narrow shafts dart off in several directions, with ladders and pulleys connecting to shafts at shallower and deeper levels. There are also some larger chambers used for storing disused trolleys, mining tools, and basic amenities for the miners, including a makeshift shower. An ominous red metal door is locked wi…",

          "description": "Jack in the Box's Sourdough Smashed Jack features a quarter-pound smashed beef patty, American cheese, pickles, grilled onions, and Boss Sauce (a burger sauce that's also found on the Smashed Jack) served on grilled sourdough rounds.\n\nI paid $8.59 for one and it's basically the Smashed Jack but one grilled sourdough rather than a brioche bun. For whatever reason, they fully wrapped the burger and then placed it in a clamshell box.\n\n\nThe beef patty offered a robust meaty flavor. It was thick but just a tad short in width to achieve full bread coverage. The grind was a little too fine for a burger. There was a nice browned crust on the patty but none of the crunch you might get from a smashed patty. The temperature was warm rather than hot.\n\n\n\nThe sourdough rounds were not sour at all and only lightly crispy. They were mostly soft and chewy.\nThe American cheese was thoroughly melted and gooey.\n\n\n\nThe pickles and onions combined to provide a watery crunch. The onions were lightly sweet while the pickles added a dose of acidity. Tying it together with a combination of savory and sweet notes was the Boss Sauce.\n\n\n\nOverall, Jack in the Box's Sourdough Smashed Jack presented a solid burger that felt pricey for what you get.\nRead more at Brand Eating!",

          "description": "One last item on Acorn 8. Whether you are a longtime Acorn user (like me), or a would-be new user, you should set aside some time to actual read Acorn’s documentation. It’s a full user manual, and it not only describes, in detail, what every feature in the app does and how to use them, but also a vast array of “how-to” tutorials, many of them videos.\nIn broad strokes, there are two approaches to documenting a serious, professional-level app or software system. One was is a comprehensive functional reference resource. That’s a way that you, the user, can teach yourself how to use a feature, refresh your memory about a feature you haven’t used in a while, or even just check to see if a certain feature even exists. The other is a narrative, storytelling, tutorial approach. That’s not teaching yourself — that’s letting an expert teach you, and today that’s often a visual approach through video.\nAcorn’s document is so thorough that it encompasses both approaches. Either one would qualify Acorn as a well-documented application. But by including both, Gus Mueller should be given some sort of medal or award. Different people learn in different ways, and Acorn’s documentation is there for everyone.\nIt should go without saying, but no serious tool — hardware or software — is complete without thorough, polished documentation. Acorn goes above and beyond. It’s amazing enough that a company as small as Flying Meat — it’s really just Gus and his wife Kirstin — has produced a full-fledged professional-strength image editing application that has remained modern and cutting-edge for 17 years and counting. But it’s also accompanied by first-class comprehensive documentation.\n ★",

          "description": "Dan Moren, writing at Six Colors:\nThe newly released Acorn 8 adds a bunch of great\nfeatures to the mix. A few of them will be familiar to Apple\nplatform users: subject selection uses machine learning to let\nyou quickly isolate and grab the subject of a picture (there’s\nalso a corresponding “Remove Background” feature to simplify\nthat task) and a Live Text tool allows you to select and copy\ntext within an image.\nFor me, the star of the show is the fascinating Data Merge, which\nis a bit like Mail Merge for images. If you’ve ever needed to\ncreate the same image several times but with different information — nametags, for example, or personalized gift cards — this is a\nlife-saver. You open your template image, identify your variables,\nthen hand Acorn a CSV file with the relevant data and it will\nprocess through them, assigning text where needed and even putting\nimages in assigned layers. It’s the kind of wild automation tool\nthat might not be something you need every day, but when you do\nneed it, there’s really no replacement.\nThe rare sweet spot that Acorn hits is that it’s super-approachable to new and casual users, who just need an image editor sometimes, and super-powerful for power users who want to dig in.\n ★",

          "description": "Dave Nanian, writing on the Shirt Pocket blog:\nmacOS 15.2 was released a few days ago, with a surprise. A\nterrible, awful surprise. Apple broke the replicator. Towards\nthe end of replicating the Data volume, seemingly when it’s\nabout to copy either Preboot or Recovery, it fails with a\nResource Busy error.\nIn the past, Resource Busy could be worked around by ensuring\nthe system was kept awake. But this new bug means, on most\nsystems, there’s no fix. It just fails.\nSince Apple took away the ability for 3rd parties (eg, us) to copy\nthe OS, and took on the responsibility themselves, it’s been up to\nthem to ensure this functionality continues to work. And in that,\nthey’ve failed in macOS 15.2. Because this is their code, and\nwe’re forced to rely on it to copy the OS, OS copying will not\nwork until they fix it. [...]\nFor those who may be working for Apple, or have good contacts, the\nbug is FB16090831. A fix would be really helpful, folks.\nThis means Shirt Pocket’s outstanding utility SuperDuper can’t make a bootable clone of your startup drive on a machine running MacOS 15.2.0. It’s worth noting that you can still use SuperDuper (or other backup utilities) to clone all of your data, which is, by far, the most essential data in any backup. But bootable startup drives clones are an essential part of many people’s data integrity workflows.\nThis bug seems to affect CarbonCopyCloner and Apple’s own Time Machine, too. A bug like this is always unfortunate, but especially around the holidays, when it might take longer than usual to get fixed, even if the issue is escalated within Apple.\n ★",

          "description": "Gus Mueller:\nThis is a major update of Acorn, and is currently on a\ntime-limited sale for $19.99. It’s still a one time\npurchase to use as long as you’d like, and as usual, the full\nrelease notes are available. I want to highlight some of my\nfavorite things below.\n“Select Subject”, “Mask Subject”, and “Remove Background” are new\ncommands which use machine learning (or A.I. if you prefer) to\nfind the most important parts of your image, and then perform\ntheir respective operations. This has been a request for a long\ntime, and while I was doubtful of it’s utility, it’s actually\npretty fun to play with and more useful than I figured it would\nbe. So I’m glad I took the time to integrate it.\nYou can now set your measurement units to inches, centimeter, or\npixels, and it shows up across the tools for your image, not just\nspecific ones. This includes the crop palette, shape dimensions,\nfilter settings… well, pretty much everything. This might be the\noldest feature request I’ve implemented so far. And then related\nto this, Acorn 8 now has an on canvas ruler which you can use to\nmeasure out distances, straighten your image with, or even\nredefine the DPI.\nLook up Table (LUT) support. LUTs are pretty fun, and they work by\nmapping one set of colors to another, enabling consistent or\nstylized visual effects. LUTs are used primarily in photography or\nfilmmaking, and you can download and install new LUTs from various\nplaces across the internet.\nAnd more, so much more. The release notes are copious, and for me, always interesting. Acorn remains one of my most-used tools. It’s fast, reliable, powerful, extensible/scriptable, and the interface makes so much intuitive sense. That’s all been true since version 1.0 back in 2007, and that’s why it’s been my go-to image editor since it was in early beta before version 1.0 back in 2007. It’s just faster and more powerful today.\nAcorn is, simply put, one of the best Mac apps ever made. It’s that good. You’re nuts (sorry) if you don’t check it out while it’s available for just $20.\n ★",

DaVinci Resolve Studio will be updated to support\nediting Apple Immersive Video early next year, offering\nprofessional filmmakers a comprehensive workflow for producing\nApple Immersive Video for Apple Vision Pro. Apple Immersive Video\nis a remarkable 180-degree media format that leverages\nultra-high-resolution immersive video and Spatial Audio to place\nviewers in the center of the action.

The sensor\ndelivers 8160 × 7200 resolution per eye with pixel level\nsynchronization and an incredible 16 stops of dynamic range, so\ncinematographers can shoot 90fps 3D immersive cinema content to a\nsingle file.

          "description": "Paul Kafasis, on the Rogue Amoeba blog:\nEven as our products steadily grew in popularity, our relationship\nwith Apple was almost non-existent. Plenty of individuals inside\nthe company were fans, but we received very little attention from\nApple as a corporate entity. We didn’t much mind being outsiders,\nbut it meant that we often had zero notice of breaking changes\nintroduced by Apple.\nDuring this time, Apple placed an emphasis on improving the\nsecurity of MacOS, continually locking the operating system down\nfurther and further. Though their changes weren’t aimed at the\nlegitimate audio capture we provided our users, they nonetheless\nmade that capture increasingly difficult. We labored to keep our\ntools functioning with each new version of MacOS. Through it all,\nwe lived with a constant fear that Apple would irreparably break\nour apps.\nIn 2020, the disaster foreshadowed literally one sentence ago\nstruck. Beta versions of MacOS 11 broke ACE, our then-current\naudio capture technology, and the damage looked permanent.\nKafasis is a friend and frequent guest on The Talk Show (and holds his own as a podcast co-host with a combustible collaborator), and I use quite a few apps in Rogue Amoeba’s suite, so I was familiar with the broad outline of this saga. But seeing it all spelled out made clear it was a lot more precarious than I thought.\n ★",

          "description": "Paul Kafasis, on the Rogue Amoeba blog:\nEven as our products steadily grew in popularity, our relationship\nwith Apple was almost non-existent. Plenty of individuals inside\nthe company were fans, but we received very little attention from\nApple as a corporate entity. We didn’t much mind being outsiders,\nbut it meant that we often had zero notice of breaking changes\nintroduced by Apple.\nDuring this time, Apple placed an emphasis on improving the\nsecurity of MacOS, continually locking the operating system down\nfurther and further. Though their changes weren’t aimed at the\nlegitimate audio capture we provided our users, they nonetheless\nmade that capture increasingly difficult. We labored to keep our\ntools functioning with each new version of MacOS. Through it all,\nwe lived with a constant fear that Apple would irreparably break\nour apps.\nIn 2020, the disaster foreshadowed literally one sentence ago\nstruck. Beta versions of MacOS 11 broke ACE, our then-current\naudio capture technology, and the damage looked permanent.\nKafasis is a friend and frequent guest on The Talk Show (and holds his own as a podcast co-host with a combustible collaborator), and I use quite a few apps in Rogue Amoeba’s suite, so I was familiar with the broad outline of this saga. But seeing it all spelled out made clear it was a lot more precarious than I thought.\n ★",

          "description": "A few weeks ago, in a post primarily complaining about Google’s disingenuous claims about their Messages app’s support for encryption (they suggest, heavily, that it encrypts every message or most messages, but fact only supports encryption for RCS message sent between users of Google Messages on Android devices), I also complained about the fact that Google’s own Google Voice doesn’t support RCS at all.\nTurns out Google Fi doesn’t support RCS fully either. Google Fi is Google’s cellular phone service. I actually use it to provide service to my Android burner phone. The prices are excellent and the service is fine for my minimal needs for a phone I barely use. But Google Fi offers something called “call and voicemail sync” that lets Fi users make and answer voice calls through the web. If you enable this, you lose RCS. See Reddit threads here and here with Fi fans complaining about it.\nIt’s just wild to me that Google would spend years waging a campaign urging Apple to support RCS, yet Google itself doesn’t support RCS in its own products.\n ★",

I know sponsors are sometimes hesitant to book weeks around major holidays, but, well, Daring Fireball is never “closed”. And traffic to the site is remarkably consistent even during weeks like Thanksgiving and Christmas. Nerds get bored and want to read interesting stuff.\nQ1 2025 weeks are wide open too, but I only just now opened those weeks on the calendar.\nWeekly sponsorships have been the top source of revenue for Daring Fireball ever since I started selling them back in 2007. They’ve succeeded, I think, because they make everyone happy. They generate good money. There’s only one sponsor per week and the sponsors are always relevant to at least some sizable portion of the DF audience, so you, the reader, are never annoyed and hopefully often intrigued by them. And, from the sponsors’ perspective, they work. My favorite thing about them is how many sponsors return for subsequent weeks after seeing the results.\nIf you’ve got a product or service you think would be of interest to DF’s audience of people obsessed with high quality and good design, get in touch. And again, this coming week remains open, and the week after. I’m even offering those two weeks at a holiday discount.\n ★",

Waves of restaurateurs from the continental U.S. and abroad have opened restaurants in Honolulu, with everyone from Japanese conglomerates to Michael Mina setting up shop. But simultaneously, Honolulu’s homegrown businesses have been able to ride waves of excitement to expand themselves. In the last decade, tiny mom-and-pop restaurants have opened second locations, while established local chains expanded their reach. More and more chefs have worked to learn about Hawai‘i’s history and culture to respectfully incorporate aspects into their restaurants. That is to say, diners in Honolulu are a bit spoiled for choice.\nUpdated, December 2024:\nThe winter tourist season has descended on Honolulu, and with holiday festivities in full swing, comfort foods and neighborhood stalwarts like the homey spot Moké’s Bread and Breakfast are the draw. Despite the generally warm weather, Honolulu is a soup town, and the slight dip in temperatures this time of year has people turning to only-in-Hawai‘i noodles at Palace Saimin, around since the mid-century, and clear, restorative bowls at Phở Tô Châu, an anchor in Honolulu’s Chinatown.\nEater updates this list quarterly to make sure it reflects the ever-changing Honolulu dining scene.\nMartha Cheng is a Honolulu-based writer for a number of local and national publications, and is the author of The Poke Cookbook.",

Actually, he made six. At Hall, Odo’s “conceptual bar” in the Flatiron District, the limited menu features a selection of wagyu burgers, from a simple single cheeseburger to one topped with A5 wagyu steak. \nStep by step, general manager Brian Saito walks through crafting Hall’s burgers. He starts with a blend of Sakura Wagyu chuck and A5 wagyu, finely grinding them and controlling just how much fat is in each patty. Then there’s the sauce, a combination of sansho peppercorns, “a perfect complement for the fattiness of the wagyu,” reduced in sake and tamari. It’s a sauce, Saito says, they also use at chef Odo’s titular kaiseki restaurant next door. All of it gets piled on buns made from the chef’s own recipe, “so their key point is a sense of unity.”\nThe entire Hall menu is in service of wanting to bring a variety of experiences to New York diners, says chef Odo, and to showcase all the cuisines Japan has to offer. But, he admits, multiple concepts in one space “isn’t the kind of restaurant you could open in Japan.” A cocktail and burger bar, in front of a chef’s counter, next to a kaiseki restaurant? That’s New York. \nWatch the latest episode of Icons to see how Odo and Saito create one of New York’s best burgers.",

A genuine creativity around incorporating new flavors into smash burgers has made the inevitable turn into a mandatory menu addition for every place that is trying to be the next big thing. It’s prett…",

There’s a lot going on this time of year, and a trip to the mall definitely won’t make you feel any less stressed out about getting everything checked off your to-do list.\nBut there is a foolproof solution that doesn’t involve making a frantic, last-minute shopping trip: just give the recipient you have in mind a really great food subscription box. It’s both an easy gift and a win-win: Your recipient gets to open a present multiple times over the course of the next year, and you’ll also save yourself several headaches by jumping online and ordering something to be shipped directly to their door instead of fight…",

          "description": "Day 11 of the Eater Advent Calendar reveals a rich matcha perfect straight-up or in lattes\n \n\n\nIf you are looking to impress a tea friend or matcha enthusiast, this is the matcha I would suggest. It toes the line between being fancy and flavorful without having an appalling price tag. Its deep green hue is an indicator of the high-quality matcha each tin provides, but if that doesn’t convince you, the aroma — and flavor — will. This matcha is rich, floral, and subtly sweet but rounded out by mild bitterness. It’s delicious drunk straight because the matcha is already so smooth, but I also find it adds the perfect earthy bite to matcha lattes. I love to pair it with warm milk and a drizzle of vanilla bean paste for a fragrant matcha latte that is arguably better than any of the pale, $8 versions you might order at a coffee shop. One warning: Once you try this matcha, you can never go back to the cheaper stuff (nor will you want to, anyway).\n\n\n\nNo peeking! But check out what the Eater Advent Calendar has already revealed.  And check back each day for a new clutch condiment, gadget, or nibble that, yes, makes an amazing gift — but these surprises are just for you.",

          "description": "Hello HN,\nI’m excited to share Bodo, an open-source compute engine designed for large-scale data processing in native Python. Bodo is powered by an auto-parallelizing JIT compiler and an HPC backend, enabling it to generate highly optimized, parallel binaries (MPI) for Pandas and NumPy code—all without requiring any code rewrites.\nOur latest benchmark demonstrates 20x to 240x speedup over traditional distributed computing frameworks like Spark, Ray, and Dask (code and details in repo).\nThe inspiration for Bodo came from my background in HPC, when I saw how extremely slow and hard to use Spark was (has gotten better over the years but still not great). Of course, a compiler has its own limitations (e.g. not all Python is compilable), but I think it’s leaps and bounds better.\nLet me know what you think.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42452799\nPoints: 8\n# Comments: 2",

I was surprised to learn that much of this data was just an API call away thanks to Coinbase, and of course took inspiration from many of the other wrapped products out there, too.\nI hope you learn something interesting and maybe get a chuckle out of it.

I've built a new interface for bioRxiv+medRxiv to directly browse preprint findings on the genome!\nTo begin I downloaded 7TB's of bioRxiv+medRxiv preprints and extracted mentions of genetic variant ID's or positions. Documented in \"How to download bioRxiv on a budget\": http://sitlabs.org/writing/biorxiv.html\nThis project started after I was trawling through Google Scholar to review a gene when I realised I had missed relevant upstream findings which hadn't been linked to the gene. I wondered if there could be a better interface to explore genetic literature?\nNext I provided the variant mentions and paper context to gpt-4o-mini and requested structured output summarising the scientific finding. Finally I mapped all variants to the latest genome build and plotted them on our custom genome browser.\nThis project was made by the new Scientific Interface & Tooling Lab (http://sitlabs.org) at Oxford. We will be releasing new interfaces and tools to improve scientific productivity with an initial focus on biology research.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42452589\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

I’m seeing less than 100 KB in assets and pages loads in under 0.5 seconds for the project I’m using to track Planisphere’s own development.\nWhile the major features are already in place, including user management, I’m actively building out feature parity, including integrations, dynamic iteration velocity, reporting, and more.\nPlanisphere offers a 14-day free trial with no credit card required, after which it’s just $6 per user per month. I’m also working on migration tools to make the transition seamless.

After the incredible and warm reception, our players convinced to finally start covering other countries. This year we worked hard to release for testing new versions for the UK and, just today, the US.\nThe game is also available as an app at:\n- Android: https://android.birdle.world\n- iOS: https://ios.birdle.world\nThe version is still in beta for testing, as we are still learning about US birds, so any feedback is strongly appreciated :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42450269\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "While building SaaS products, we noticed a recurring problem: content performance hinges on the first few words. Hooks determine success, but defining and generating effective hooks programmatically is hard.\nHere’s how we approached the challenge:\n1. The problem:\nAttention is subjective and context-dependent. Identifying patterns that consistently work across platforms is complex.\n2. Our approach:\n- Data collection: Analyzed high-performing LinkedIn posts, social media ads, and email subject lines.\n- Lightweight NLP system: Developed a system to identify linguistic patterns like structure, emotional triggers, and readability.\n- Fine-tuned GPT models to generate hooks based on frameworks observed in the data.\n3. Tech challenges we tackled:\n- Balancing creativity and relevance to ensure hooks are engaging without veering into clickbait.\n- Building 15+ adaptable frameworks such as curiosity-driven questions, data-backed insights, and emotional prompts.\n- Iterating with user feedback to refine hook quality and ensure consistent results.\nThe result is a system that identifies attention-grabbing patterns and generates hooks that perform well across platforms.\nWe’re actively building out new features and optimizations. If you have feedback on our approach, the tech, or ideas to explore, we’d love to hear from you.

          "description": "Hello HN!\nWe developed a browser extension that blocks distracting sites. The killer feature is that we use LLMs and user-defined goals to provide the best possible blocking experience.\nThe decision-making process is not binary, we have multiple categories, allowing for more nuanced user interactions. This makes the browsing experience much less frustrating compared to other website blockers.\nSites like Reddit or YouTube are not always bad, and Wikipedia or other educational resources are not always good. By considering what the user is working on, we are able to make more informed and effective decisions.\nOther blockers rely on pre-made blocklists for distracting websites. This approach is clearly insufficient for most use cases, as curating such lists is tedious—whether for the developer or the user.\nWe've also added quality-of-life features, including whitelists, blacklists, active hours, temporary unblocking, nuclear mode and a well-integrated (and optional) Pomodoro timer.\nLearnings:\nInitially, we scraped page content to make decisions. However, this approach posed significant privacy concerns. Now, all our decisions are based on tab metadata, ensuring a much better level of privacy and much better performance. No page content is transferred to the server.\nData collection:\nWe don't store browsing data unless the user explicitly reports incorrect decisions, BYOB model version will be released soon as well based on user demand.\nLinks:\n[1] https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hedge-ai-powered-di...\n[2] https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hedge-ai-dist...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42449837\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

Instead of working with a preloaded database or enriching a list of existing leads, it lets you input your industry and generates fresh leads tailored to your needs.\nThe standout feature is its AI-driven data customization—you can request specific details like product prices or summaries in plain language, and the tool retrieves the information for you. It even includes a chatbot where you can ask follow-up questions about any lead and get answers instantly, saving a ton of time on manual research.\nDoes anyone know of other tools that combine lead generation with AI-powered data enrichment and instant chat-based queries? I’d love to explore more options!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42449162\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I created a web framework called kinekt and would like to introduce it to the community. Kinekt is a TypeScript-first, high-performance web framework built on web standards. It has the following features which set it apart from other frameworks in the javascript realm:\n- It is 100% type safe. It supports the use of zod schemas to declare endpoints\n- It has great DX. It auto-infers a client function for every endpoint you declare, making it extremely useful for developing full-stack web apps which are completely written in TypeScript\n- It is highly modular. The middleware engine is unlike most other existing implementations and follows a functional-style paradigm\nIt is still in early development stages.

Connect with the tools your business uses (currently Slack or Gmail).\n2. Create workflows by dragging and dropping nodes onto the canvas.\n3. Listen to incoming events or trigger workflows manually.\nBehind the scenes:\n1. Each workflow runs as a durable, long-running execution.\n2. AI agents within the same workflow share memory.\n3. AI agents associate different channels, such as Slack threads or Gmail email threads, with workflows and can understand when replies are linked to specific workflow executions.\nTry it out:\nhttps://tryworkloop.com\nThere will be bugs!!

          "description": "I made this app for myself, but it's probably worth sharing.\nWhen I tried to find a nice app that I could use to check air quality multiple times a day, I was shocked. All of them looked boring with traffic-light coding and overcrowded with unnecessary data. On top of that, they either contained ads or required payment.\nI didn't want to use any of those apps every day, so I thought, \"Well, how hard could it be?\" and accepted the challenge. I expected to finish development in a month, but since I'm a designer and don't normally program apps, I had to learn Swift on the go. This required a month more than I expected.\nIn my designs, I'm usually way too focused on efficiency. Since this was my personal project, I wanted to experiment, so I didn't use standard controls or color coding.\nInspired by avant-garde style, I used forms and movement to convey air quality, as well as an asymmetrical layout and overflowing visualizations. I enjoy using the app, and I hope you will, too.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42446515\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

You can manage your job search more effectively by populating your professional connections and tracking companies of interest. Once set up, you can deploy it to a server to continuously scrape new job postings and share them directly to a Discord channel via free webhooks. This makes it easy to stay updated on relevant opportunities in real-time.\nWhy I made this?:\nLinkedIn sucks, their email blasts are often spammy and filled with irrelevant listings. On top of that, if you’re relying solely on mainstream platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed, it’s nearly impossible to be first in line for a newly posted opportunity. It scrapes company job boards directly, ensuring you’re notified of opportunities the moment they go public.\nStill making improvements everyday but you can give it a try using Homebrew (macOs) or install via Cargo (windows, linux).

          "description": "I started this project because I believe MCP has the potential to transform how AI models interact with external resources, but the ecosystem is still very fragmented. There's no central place to discover and compare all the server implementations available, which makes adoption and experimentation harder for developers.\nI initially built the GitHub repo awesome-mcp-servers (https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers/), and it's been amazing to see the community contribute to it. Now, I'm taking it further with a directory that automates many tasks—introspecting servers to determine the tools, resources, and prompts they provide, inferring required configurations, and checking dependencies for vulnerabilities. These features are designed to make it easier for people to trust and use these servers in production environments.\nWhile an open-source protocol is fantastic for innovation, I also think we need a centralized channel for addressing critical issues like security vulnerabilities, dependency management, and user support. My hope is that this directory not only grows with help from contributions, but also becomes a trusted resource for anyone entering the MCP space. If you're working on MCP servers or are interested in the project, I'd love to hear your thoughts!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42443069\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hello HN!\nIn a recent \"Ask HN: What are you working on?\" thread, I mentioned I was working on OCRing a large book:\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41971614\nThe post generated some interest so I thought I would keep HN posted.\nThe book is Saint-Simon’s Memoirs -- an invaluable historical account of the French court under Louis XIV, full of wit, sharp observations, and of incredible literary value. I'm OCRing the edition of reference made between 1879-1930, that contains a lot of comments and footnotes: 45 volumes, ~27,000 pages.\nHere's a link to a blog post that describes the techniques used so far (the project is still ongoing):\nhttps://blog.medusis.com/38_Adventures+in+OCR.html\nBut you may also directly access the result here:\nhttps://divers.medusis.net/boislisle/pub\nThis web app (not optimized for mobile, sorry) solves a tricky problem of preloading images efficiently. In short: preloading the next image isn't enough, since browsers will repaint if an image is moved, or scaled. Or browsers won't paint at all if visibility is hidden or opacity is zero, and will paint only when those values change. On an average, slow machine, this takes visible time. But if an image is simply behind another element, it will be painted, and the removal of the covering element or changing the z-index will not trigger a repaint.\n(Preloading is important because it lets one review results fast; if one has to wait 150-200 ms between images it's simply discouraging).\nWould love to hear feedback; happy to answer any question!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42443022\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "We built a way to go from requirements to a fully working admin panel/internal tool -type application within minutes. As a user you provide the various entities and their relationship plus any reports or dashboard widgets and it will generate it for you.\nThe problem with existing no code tools is that you still need to spend a lot of time building after figuring out what is needed (a problem of its own). Being able to focus on what is needed means you can build faster than designing, dragging, dropping, configuring.\nWhat can you describe? Everything from tables, field types, relationships between tables and columns/fields, role-based access restrictions (RBAC), reports, dashboard metrics, bar/line/pie charts, lists.\nThis is made possible by fine-tuning Llama 3.1 to convert requirements into specs and code. Applications evolve over time and this means that the model has to be predictable between versions to ensure that the data/schema migrations can be generated cleanly, as well as provide any errors and warnings related to the requirements or data loss.\nFor non-developers this can be a huge time-saver since you don't have to use any additional developer resources. For developers it can be a great way to get 80+% of the way for complex apps (it's like super-scaffolding). Generated apps can be fully evaluated before purchase. A full git repo containing the back-end, front-end, migrations, etc. is the output of the entire process.\nCurrently the generated code base is TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next.js but the capability is there to generate different stacks because of the approach taken to not go directly to code when fine-tuning.\nBrought to you by the team at Red Axle (https://redaxle.com)\nCheck out the video at https://youtu.be/rPppwB4jPlQ for a smaller app.\nWe look forward to your thoughts. Does building apps this way make sense for the super savvy HN crowd?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42442879\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

I had to do a lot of infra work, and while this being billable hours for me I didn’t enjoy the work at all. For some parts of it, there were nice solutions like dbt, but in the end for an end-to-end workflow, it didn’t work. That’s why I decided to build an end-to-end solution that could take care of data ingestion, transformation, and Python stuff. Initially, it was just for our own usage, but in the end, we thought this could be a useful tool for everyone.\nI…",

Many sellers like me rely on DMs or clunky solutions, which can make managing sales and payments a headache. I wanted to simplify the process by turning my Instagram into a fully functioning storefront, quickly and effortlessly.\nWhat CheckoutLink does: \n Turn Instagram posts into shoppable links—sell directly through DMs or bio links. \n Manage products, buyers, sales and payments from one simple dashboard.\n Sync your PayPal or Stripe account to get paid instantly. \n Quick setup with no coding or website required.\nI'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback or any suggestions you have to make CheckoutLink even better.

          "description": "Hi HN! Agora is a search engine for e-commerce products. We've indexed 4 million products sold on 8,100 Shopify and WooCommerce stores and made them easy to purchase with a single cart transaction. Think of a decentralized Amazon.\nI originally launched Agora as a side project here on HN to find a pair of red shoes for my wife last Christmas. I quickly realized that some of the best products on the internet are sold by small online stores that struggle to get the same visibility as large retailers. I started Agora on a mission to solve this problem. If you sell the best pair of red shoes in the world, customers should be able to find it.\nWe recently built a merchant dashboard that helps Shopify and WooCommerce merchants sell more on our search engine. Agora Merchants connects to your existing e-commerce store without any painful setup required and helps you track your store's performance on Agora. We don't take a commission of sales, orders are routed to your existing point of sale system, and inventory is automatically uploaded and refreshed. We do this with a combination of crawlers and AI agents.\nSo how is this different than Amazon? Both Amazon and Agora give network effects to stores (i.e. if you're searching for red shoes from one store, you may also want to buy a red dress sold by a different store). The key difference with Agora is that you continue selling on your existing e-commerce store, without having to manage inventory and payouts on another platform. This creates a magical experience for our merchants that saves them hundreds of hours. We believe in a future where merchants can sell however they want, we just bring them more customers.\nI'd love your feedback!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42441895\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

As organizers, you post a handful on social media while the best moments are scattered across attendee phones. And if you’re hoping for engagement or visibility? It’s a grind.\nWe built Premagic, an event tool that flips this problem.\nHere’s what we do:\nInstant Photo Sharing: We use AI to auto-select the best event photos and share them in real time with attendees. They get photos they love. You get organic visibility when they share (and they do).\nBranded Advocacy Posters: Personalized “I’m attending” or “I’m speaking” posters are generated automatically—no designer needed. Attendees become your event’s marketing army.\nAI Avatar Check-Ins: We turn event check-ins into an experience. Attendees can generate personalized, branded avatars on the spot—fun, shareable, and sponsor-friendly.\nWe’ve tested this at over 2,000 events and seen a 3x increase in organic social reach for organizers. Event marketers and sponsors love it because it amplifies visibility without paid ads.\nWe’re event tech folks trying to make photos and moments work harder—organically.\nWould love your feedback!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42441651\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

This allows for easy and permanent local storage, searchability, and integration with note-taking applications like Obsidian (which I use). If you sync again after continuing conversations, ChatKeeper will find your conversation files — even if you've moved or renamed them — and update them in place, so you can reorganize them to your heart's content.\nMany of my conversations have some lasting value, e.g. for reference or as part of a larger project.

I built Savvy so you can capture and share your CLI solutions in seconds.\nWith a simple savvy record history command, you can:\n   - Go back in time and cherry pick commands from your shell history\n   - Automatically expand aliases\n   - Redact sensitive information locally\n   - Convert hard-coded values into runtime placeholders\n   - Export locally to markdown files or create shareable team workflows using Savvy.\n\nSome FAQs\nQ) How Does Savvy’s CLI work?\n   Savvy’s CLI uses shell hooks (full support for bash and zsh. Fish support is in beta) to capture commands. Savvy’s CLI never looks at any command outputs or active keystrokes. Users have to explicitly opt-in (by typing savvy record/savvy record history) to capture commands every single time.\n\n   Once you select a particular workflow with savvy run, savvy starts a new sub-shell and walks you through each step of the way. No manual copy paste or editing commands to provide run time values.\n\n   Demo: https://getsavvy.so/demo\n\n   Savvy takes your redacted commands as input and uses Llama 3.x hosted on Groq to create a first draft of your workflow.\n\n   Savvy ask/explain are powered by  GPT 4/GPT4o to convert natural language to shell commands and vice-versa.\n\n   GitHub: https://github.com/getsavvyinc/savvy-cli\n   Demo: https://getsavvy.so/demo\n   Docs: https://docs.getsavvy.so/guides/quick_start/\n   Example workflows: https://getsavvy.so/#examples\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42436589\nPoints: 15\n# Comments: 0",

Simply, it makes productivity and studying instantly rewarding and engaging from the start, increasing the chance of consistency in the long term.\nYou can start \"training sessions\" which are the timers where you are meant to focused. During this, if you are studying you can take AI generated quizzes based on certain subjects. Right now its a dropdown selection of set topics as I'm not sure of the safety of allowing people to type whatever they want to the AI, but I might change that.\nAfter the training sessions, based on the time trained and the team you have built, you receive points. These points can be used to build up your team by opening packs of various rarities. With this, you feel rewarded from getting points and being productive instantly. Along with this, you can join 'leagues' which are rooms with other people to compete to be the best. Also, you can compete in real time matches against others to make your team have more worth than show.\nIts publicly released but I'm still improving it daily and all I would like is for people to use it and give feedback, good or bad.

There is a new regulation in Europe that mandates a defined XML-format for e-invoices for some transactions and - I kid you not - their SAP implementation wasn't able to address this. They also said that all solutions on the market were either cumbersome (think: manually typing in all fields) or required deep system integration.\nI thought it cannot be that hard to use AI for this and built a little invoice converter that takes your PDF invoice in whatever form it is, and outputs exactly the XML structure that is required in the regulation. Given that AI is not perfect (but surprisingly close to it!), you can manually edit all fields.\nTarget users are companies where their current solution does not yet support the standard and that do not want to change their existing invoicing flow (incl. foreign businesses).\nTrying it out is free.

While the questions mostly remain the same, the answers can change and may correspond to different versions, forming a roadmap for future product success. A phenotype is the visualization of an answer, evolving as the answers change over time.\nCarton provides a framework for product scoping (not project management or product design) that makes use of this definition.\nLet's think even further. With the advent of artificial intelligence, the entire process of software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Soon, software will be created more through natural conversation than traditional programming languages.\nCarton helps ensure you always have a clear record of what you've asked from the AI and, even better, helps to request what comes next.\nIts a very early proof of concept phase.

We have done data extraction/web scraping for the last few months, and we built this internally to help us. However, clients requested a SAAS tool, so here it is!\nYou guys can test it out here (app.potarix.com). Everyone who signs up gets 5$ credits. Scraping each page takes up $0.10 of your credits. You are not charged for unsuccessful scrapes!\nWe launched last week, and our platform was super buggy. We initially launched without the concept of \"jobs\" in our product, so every time you wanted to scrape a platform, you would have to wait 5 minutes on one screen to get your results. Something is bound to happen in those 5 minutes, so the task would fail for some unknown reason.\nLooking ahead, we built stuff in-house that we would love to include in the SAAS platform shortly. We have built functionality to click, type, scroll, etc. on the page. AI also tends to be wrong sometimes, so we created a tweakable script in the backend to control the agent's actions. That way, you are in control and can bring the script to 100% accuracy. We have also seen people battling to build infrastructure for their large-scale scraping projects. We wanna autonomously let folk set up parallelization and choose the infra for their project so everything is scraped as quickly and succinctly as possible from the SAAS.\nIf any of these future features sound interesting, feel free to book some time, and we can discuss how we can help you with these now!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42435480\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hey HN, I’ve been working on this multiplayer crossword for a while now. There’s still so much more on my todo list for it, but I think it’s time to launch and get some feedback with what I have.\nEvery hour, a new crossword (13×13 or 15×15) is generated at https://crosswordracing.com If you prefer smaller/faster, every ten minutes, a new mini crossword (7×7 or 11×11) is generated at https://crosswordracing.com/mini\nYou’re playing each crossword at the same time as everyone else, racing to complete it first. You can’t see what you’ve got right, until you correctly complete the entire grid. But you get some fun feedback on what other players are doing: a cell turns green if one other player has correctly solved it, orange if two other players have, and red if three or more other players have entered the correct letter in that cell.\nChat is emoji-only for the first half of the game (i.e. 30 minutes for the front-page, 5 minutes for the mini). After that, it unlocks and you can chat freely.\nIf you’re not done when the next crossword is generated, you can just stay on the current page for as long as you like and keep working to solve it.\nI didn’t manage to get user accounts done before my arbitrarily-imposed launch date, so everyone is anonymous for now. I definitely want to build accounts, streaks, trophies, etc. The other big thing I’m excited to build is a “team mode”. You should be able to play on a team, where you can chat freely with your team-mates, and the cell colors indicate what the other team has (collaboratively) got correct. I think that would be a lot of fun.\nThanks for reading, checking it out, and for any feedback. Feel free to ask me anything, of course.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42434157\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I honestly hate freelancing because it often feels unclear and stressful when starting new jobs, especially when employers aren’t sure what they want.\nFor the past few years, I’ve focused on specific projects like mobile chat apps using Flutter. With my existing codebase and experience, these jobs are easier and less stressful. I usually sell my codebase and move on.\nHowever, finding these types of jobs is challenging. I tried many Upwork alert apps, but they either don’t work well or have over 95% false positives.\nThat’s why I created UpHunt. With UpHunt, you can create multiple profiles, and AI will match your profiles with Upwork jobs. You’ll receive instant notifications and can be the first to apply.\nIt's still a completely free project.

You'll get notifications (email + app) when significant events matching your criteria are detected. For short-term projects, you'll be notified when your analysis is ready.\nBehind the scenes:\nWhen you give the AI Assistant a request to monitor an entity (like a stock or group of stocks), an AI Project Manager plans the project and breaks the project down into manageable tasks. These tasks run asynchronously - some recurring (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly), others one-time.\nExample prompts you can try:\nLong-term monitoring:\n- \"Monitor Apple stock and notify me of any important events and red flags\"\n- \"Monitor Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta stock. Notify me if any of them start trending toward being undervalued\"\nShort-term analysis:\n- \"Create a project to analyze the last 30 earnings calls for Tesla, spot trends, and how the business has evolved over time\"\nYou can track the progress of all tasks as the AI Agents work in the background.\nTry it here: https://decodeinvesting.com/chat\nThis is still an early version - we're actively improving it based on feedback.

          "description": "Hey HN,\nWe’re excited to share PySpur, an open-source tool that provides a graph-based interface for building, debugging, and evaluating LLM workflows.\nWhy we built this:\nBefore this, we built several LLM-powered applications that collectively served thousands of users. The biggest challenge we faced was ensuring reliability: making sure the workflows were robust enough to handle edge cases and deliver consistent results.\nIn practice, achieving this reliability meant repeatedly:\n1. Breaking down complex goals into simpler steps: Composing prompts, tool calls, parsing steps, and branching logic.  \n2. Debugging failures: Identifying which part of the workflow broke and why.  \n3. Measuring performance: Assessing changes against real metrics to confirm actual improvement.\nWe tried some existing observability tools or agent frameworks and they fell short on at least one of these three dimensions. We wanted something that allowed us to iterate quickly and stay focused on improvement rather than wrestling with multiple disconnected tools or code scripts.\nWe eventually arrived at three principles upon which we built PySpur :\n1. Graph-based interface: We can lay out an LLM workflow as a node graph. A node can be an LLM call, a function call, a parsing step, or any logic component. The visual structure provides an instant overview, making complex workflows more intuitive.  \n2. Integrated debugging: When something fails, we can pinpoint the problematic node, tweak it, and re-run it on some test cases right in the UI.   \n3. Evaluate at the node level: We can assess how node changes affect performance downstream.\nWe hope it's useful for other LLM developers out there, enjoy!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42433689\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

But every tool I tried was either bloated with 50+ features I didn’t need or way too expensive (some were charging $70/month!). These people think I'm made of money!\nSo I decided to build my own AI resume builder.\nIt’s simple and streamlined:\nIt takes your resume and the job post and generates  a custom resume tailored to that post. (We do not store your resume or use it to train the AI)\nWhat used to take me 20-30 minutes now takes 30 seconds.\nI’ve gotten callbacks from companies like Apple, Nvidia, Meta, and Amazon using it.\nThe pricing is designed to be accessible: the more jobs you apply to, the cheaper it gets — around $2 per resume.\nI'd love for you to try it out and let me know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42433683\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

Having a short insightful conversation where AI coaches you can be powerful but it's hard to get right with a general purpose chat LLM because they don't propose stories, lack context and don't track progression\nI'm building Socratify with the hypothesis that a product built around AI questioning humans and proposing interesting questions daily can be 100x more rewarding than book summaries and other passive content.\nInspired by Charlie Munger's concept of a latticework of models that you apply to new situation. Socratify teaches you a concept (e.g., Disruption), discusses a situation where it's applicable, (e.g., Google vs. Perplexity) and gives you feedback as well as the strongest counterargument\nCheckout the first release at https://www.socratify.com/\nAppreciate thoughts from the HN community and would love to learn what you would want from an AI coach that makes you better every day\n(Note you have to sign up to use but 5 stories are free)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42431535\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",
