Many of the reasons are obvious: Biles is the greatest gymnast of all time, she comes off as cool as hell in interviews, she threw an Instagram funeral for her history-making vault, and she has stood up against both athlete abuse and also her haters. But now add this to the list: She's the reason video evidence exists that might be key to Jordan Chiles getting her bronze Olympic medal restored. \nA little refresher: Chiles competed in the floor competition in Paris this summer, and her preliminary score put her in fifth. Afterward, one of her coaches, Cecile Landi, challenged her score. It worked; after reviewing one element of Chiles's routine, a Gogean, the judges bumped up Chiles's difficulty score by 0.1, which put Chiles in third place and pushed Romanian athlete Ana Barbosu down to fourth.",

That subject, according to several reports, is none other than failed presidential candidate and notable animal corpse defiler Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was the subject of a November 2023 Nuzzi profile.\nPer a statement from New York's comms department, Nuzzi has been placed on leave while the magazine conducts a third-party review. Nuzzi told Darcy after his story broke that \"earlier this year, the nature of some communication\" between herself and a subject \"turned personal.\" She said the relationship was \"never physical but should have been disclosed to prevent the appearance of a conflict.\" In a note to New York staff, editor David Haskell said Nuzzi, 31, claimed not to have used Kennedy, 70, as a source during their relationship, which started in December 2023 and ended in August. Kennedy's people denied the existence of such a relationship and merely told Darcy, \"Mr. Kennedy only met Olivia Nuzzi once in his life for an interview she requested, which yielded a hit piece.\"",

          "description": "Sunset Rubdown was a shooting star. The band began as a solo project for Spencer Krug's bedroom recordings, and expanded into one of the weirdest, densest, most essential bands of the late 2000s. As one of Wolf Parade's vocalists and creative forces, Krug was already building some buzz for himself as a vital voice in the burgeoning indie rock moment, but he had too many ideas for even that once-prolific band. That's where Sunset Rubdown came in.\nFollowing the project's solo and lo-fi debut album, 2005's Snake's Got A Leg, the band released as strong a trilogy of albums as any act to come out of the music-blog era. Shut Up I Am Dreaming, from 2006, was the breakout, landing on year-end best-of lists, thanks to its simultaneously glittering, brooding, and claustrophobic sound, and its expansive instrument collages. As an aside, this is where I hopped aboard the Sunset Rubdown train, having heard the album shortly into my first semester of college a year after its release. For someone only just starting to broaden his musical horizons, Shut Up I Am Dreaming was a sledgehammer to the brain. (I mean that as a compliment.)",

In Worcester, where I grew up, St. John’s and St. Peter’s played each other at the end of every football season for almost a century. It was the longest-running Catholic high-school rivalry in the country. They played every Thanksgiving morning at Fitton Field, the home ground of the Holy Cross Crusaders, about whom more anon.\nThe two schools had stood as monuments to the massive Irish diaspora to Worcester of which my family was a part. I went to St. Peter’s for elementary school and to St. John’s for high school. St. John’s moved to the suburbs in 1959, which turned out to be a fateful move for both schools and fatal for their rivalry. St. Peter’s stayed in Worcester, but it merged with a girls’ high school and became St. Peter-Marian. St. John’s gradually grew beyond St. Peter’s in every way, including in its football program. The two schools ended the rivalry with their 95th meeting in 2019. St. John’s won, 35-12.",

This year, a one-way year as he recovers from Tommy John surgery, he just up and decided to double his previous stolen base high, because I guess he was bored not pitching. Sure, why not. Next year he might play goal for the Kings. It feels just as realistic. He makes baseball seem like a matter of willpower. If you can dream it, he might do it, and he might do the undreamt too. The 50/50 club—50 home runs, 50 stolen bases—was not a thing. No one was in it. Those are two very different skills, and guys who hit for power don't tend to run well, and vice versa. Whatever. Ohtani did it. I think he can do anything.\nExcept be patient, perhaps. When he joined the 40/40 club last month, 21 games faster than anyone had ever done so, he said he felt relief, as all the pending pomp was getting in the way of the thing he really wants to do: step into the box and hit the dang ball. “It was something I wanted to get over as soon as possible because the balls were being exchanged every time I was up to bat,\" he said.",

It was the complete Robles experience. Here's a lovable guy with enough pathos to befriend a wild praying mantis, and also a guy who will follow it up with one of the worst base-running experiences you've ever witnessed, all within the very first inning of the game. The Mariners went on to lose 11-2, which is one point in Robles's defense: It probably wouldn't have mattered anyway.\nOn Thursday, the Mariners were tied 1-1 with the Yankees when, in the bottom of the 10th inning, Randy Arozarena struck out swinging on a dropped third strike. His bat went sailing over the third-base line and nearly took out Julio Rodríguez, who danced out of the way and then forgot that the ball was still in play. He took a wide jog about the base, turning to the dugout, while Jazz Chisholm Jr. stood on base and called for the ball. It took a few beats for Yankees catcher Austin Wells to make the throw, but Rodríguez was still doubled off easily. The Mariners went on to lose this game, 2-1.",

          "description": "When you think about it, it's a bit strange that the best team in the world added the best player in the world, thereby forming a potentially era-defining superteam, and yet it doesn't seem like the union between Real Madrid and Kylian Mbappé has been received as the monumental occasion it truly is.\nPart of it comes from the collective exhaustion with the endless will-they-or-won't-they dynamic between player and club. Watching the two make goo-goo eyes at each other from across the Pyrenees for four years straight bled the courtship of all its titillation, even now that they're finally fucking. The other part is probably a response to the infinitely impressive but still somewhat dulling nature of Madrid's success. So you're telling me the reigning Champions League champions, winners of six of the last 11 European Cups, are the favorites to win the Champions League again?",

          "description": "Nightbitch is billed as a film about an overburdened stay-at-home mom who turns into a dog at night in order to free herself from her shackles. But it’s the night part rather than the bitch part that stands out here. This is a movie about a woman (Amy Adams) whose days have been stolen, who is pushed so far that the narrative has to contort into fantasy in order to break her out of her reality. This is her reality: Cast iron pan, sizzling butter, frozen hash brown, lunch with kid, walk with kid, library with kid, cast iron pan, sizzling butter, frozen hash brown, lunch with kid, walk with kid, library with kid. Time passes in blocks of repetition for this nameless mother who seems to exist only to complete the tasks that keep her child (not even herself) alive, one of countless Jeanne Dielmans pacing the planet, her identity absorbed by these mundane chores that mark the time ticking by and her life along with it. She seems barely there, even her epic earnest responses to outside questions about her life are only answered truthfully in her head, as she presents a frictionless surface. Or maybe not entirely frictionless. A slight grimace here, a pleading look there, something is starting to peek through the veneer. \nThis woman is so alone in this temporal hell that you are surprised when a man (Scoot McNairy) suddenly shows up. And this is the part of an otherwise generic-veering movie about the power of motherhood that stuck out in my mind. Because Nightbitch is the rare mainstream Hollywood movie that not only dissects a particular kind of passive male uselessness—in this case the father who is barely there and when he is there is barely there—but how that uselessness can actively prey on women’s time.",

Even with the City Football Group ownership angle, it's hard to deny that Girona breaking into the top three of La Liga last season was very cool. Hell, even as a Barcelona fan, I found myself pulling for a Gironiste title charge during the club's season-opening points barrage, when it led the league into January. Though winning La Liga turned out to be just a pipe dream, third place and a debutant spot in the Champions League was more than enough consolation for a club that isn't all that big, and one that often has served as a Manchester City feeder club.\nOn Wednesday, Girona made that Champions League debut in France, taking on the new-look Paris Saint-Germain—\"new look\" meaning \"no longer employs Kylian Mbappé\"—in the opening match of group ... well, there's actually no more group play in the Champions League. Love or hate the new format—I'm a centrist, leaning ever so slightly towards the hate side—the stated goal of the tournament is to get more games that matter on the calendar. (The unstated goal of the tournament is to simply get more games, and more money, on the calendar.) To have the French champions, a veritable juggernaut, take on the upstart Spaniards ... that's the type of match this new format was seemingly made for.",

The general rule, however, is: If in public you be, your feet they shan't see. Jose Altuve failed to obey this maxim, and he was summarily ejected from a wild Astros win against the Padres for podiatric crimes.\nAltuve ended the top of the ninth inning by grounding out to third, stranding the go-ahead runner on second with the score tied at three runs apiece and giving San Diego a chance to walk it off. Houston's tiny second baseman did not even try to run to first, however, as he claimed he'd fouled the pitch off of his left foot. The video of the play (7:43 in the below highlight reel) shows pretty clearly that Altuve did bonk his own foot, though home plate umpire Brennan Miller wasn't having it. Despite the protestations of Altuve and his manager Joe Espada, the play was not reviewable and the initial ruling therefore stood—which did not stop Altuve from unsocking himself to present evidence. Miller drew the line at toe reveal, and ejected Altuve.",

          "description": "A baseball player’s picture is worth a thousand words and, according to a new lawsuit filed by the MLBPA against online sportsbooks, lots of gambling dollars. \nThe suit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleges that Boston-based DraftKings and the UK-headquartered Bet365 used ballplayers’ images without permission while promoting gambling offerings. According to the complaint, both companies inappropriately appropriated “nearly every active MLB player’s image” for their websites and social media accounts, “including in posts encouraging customers to place bets on the featured player.”",
