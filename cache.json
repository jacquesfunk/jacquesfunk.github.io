          "description": "Connor McDavid is having a quiet season by his standards, which means he's got 65 points in 43 games—ho hum. He's still the scariest person on the ice with the puck on his stick, and if an opponent can take him out of a play at the cost of one of their own, there's not a player alive they wouldn't make that trade for. Unfortunately for McDavid, \"superstar calls\" in the NHL work the opposite way—less skilled defenders are more or less allowed to harass, pester, and otherwise torment the league's most talented skaters, right up to and slightly past the line of a foul, because officials simply won't call the rulebook to the letter if it'd mean whistling a penalty every seven seconds. It's enough to frustrate anyone into cross-checking Conor Garland in the face.\nIn the wild closing seconds of Vancouver's 3-2 win over Edmonton on Saturday, Garland took it upon himself to remove McDavid as a threat. Keep an eye on them during the last-minute barrage in the Canucks' end: Garland pulls McDavid to the ice and holds his arm so he can't get up. McDavid throws a punch, gets to his skates—and is promptly wrapped up and dragged down a second time. That was enough for him. After getting to his feet again, he delivered a cross-check to Garland's grill. Can't do that.",

          "description": "The Ohio State Buckeyes are the national champions of the 2024 college football season, and victors of the inaugural 12-team playoff. The Buckeyes dismantled Notre Dame, 34-23, and despite a valiant effort by the Irish in the second half, the result was never really in much doubt. It was a fitting end to the scorched-earth campaign undertaken by the Buckeyes and head coach Ryan Day who, following an embarrassing 13-10 loss to rival Michigan, went on to blow out Tennessee, then No. 1 seed Oregon, then Texas, and finally Notre Dame. After all that, Ryan Day has finally proven he can win the big one, and the projected $20 million that was spent in NIL money to put together this championship roster ended up being a worthwhile investment.\nOhio State quarterback Will Howard threw for 231 yards on 17-of-21 passing, ran for another 57 yards, and finished with two touchdowns and no interceptions. After executing an 18-play drive to score first, which included nine QB runs by Riley Leonard, the Irish spent the rest of the first half completely shut out. Leonard threw for 255 yards overall and ran for 40. Although Leonard led a decent comeback to get back within eight points in the second half, Ohio State had too much firepower to feel truly threatened.",

          "description": "Nothing lingers in the aftermath of failure quite like the decision not taken that could have become success. Thus, the Baltimore Ravens will spend the next eight months asking why, with their last chance to advance to the AFC championship game against Kansas City, they chose not to make the safe and logically defensible play to save themselves with their most reliable weapon. With two yards and two points to gain that would have put the Ravens in a 27-27 tie with the Buffalo Bills, they decided not to use running back Derrick Henry to get them, and the result will operate as a trigger for years of recriminations, because that's how sports works—the losses always linger longer.\nAnd the most maddening thing for the Ravens and their fans is that the play they called that would have tied the game worked brilliantly, all the way until the moment that ultra-reliable tight end Mark Andrews dropped the sure-thing conversion pass from Lamar Jackson that brought the Ravens down. It was a simple physical mistake, not a miscalculation or a mental blunder, that sent the Bills to their annual date with Kansas City this coming Sunday, and for Andrews, who had also fumbled earlier in the fourth quarter to help the Bills take an eight-point lead, the agony will be a tattoo on his chest that can be summoned on demand by NFL Films.",

His parents were basketball fans and quickly became attached to the Sixers, who won the NBA title that season, but the Eagles were an afterthought. The sport was unfamiliar.\nSelman first attended an Eagles game when they hosted the Miami Dolphins in December 1987. His family had seats in the first row of Veterans Stadium from which it was basically impossible to see the game, so they ended up getting glimpses of the game while wandering the stadium. The Eagles lost, 28-10, as Dan Marino threw for 376 yards and three touchdowns. Despite that, Selman quickly got hooked on the Birds.",

          "description": "On paper, the Houston Texans outperformed expectations. They ran more plays  than the Kansas City Chiefs, possessed the ball for longer, were better on third down, and had more total yards. The defense harried quarterback Patrick Mahomes, and after halftime the offense put together a 10-minute drive to score a touchdown to put the score within one. Ultimately, none of this mattered. Houston would have lost by double digits on Saturday if not for an intentional safety by the Chiefs at the end of their 23-14 divisional-round victory, sending them to a seventh straight AFC title game.\nNeither team lost a fumble or threw an interception, but the Texans still made a few costly mistakes. Kansas City's Nikko Remigio returned the opening kick 63 yards, and afterward Houston's Kris Boyd was flagged for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, giving the Chiefs a red-zone appearance within 13 seconds of the game. The normally reliable Texans kicker Ka'imi Fairbairn missed an extra point and a 55-yard field goal try, and had another FG attempt blocked. Houston seemed to be facing a second opponent in the play clock, and on one occasion, a rushed fourth-and-10 call was doomed before it could really develop, resulting in a 16-yard sack of Texans QB C.J. Stroud. Early in the first quarter, he came up limping after a run, and he became easier to hit. Stroud threw for 245 yards as he absorbed eight total sacks.",

          "description": "Across the entire spectrum of great American icons, there is no one quite like David Lynch. He was a walking enigma: an artist’s artist who was also somehow mainstream, an unapologetic esotericist whose work still managed to be immediately though ineffably understood, a well-known and highly regarded director who was nevertheless completely underrated. He’s arguably the most influential filmmaker of the last 50 years, and though many have tried, no one has been able to walk down the lane he invented with 1977's Eraserhead.\nLynch died on Thursday at the age of 78. He had recently been suffering from emphysema due to complications from COVID, which kept him homebound. It's another blow for Los Angeles in a grim month, since, along with being one of our great filmmakers, he was one of those luminary chroniclers of LA, on par with Joan Didion, Mike Davis, John Singleton, and Tupac. From his trilogy of LA films (Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, and Inland Empire), to his WKCR weather reports, to the apocryphal stories of his daily Bob’s Big Boy routine, and stunts like his FYC Oscar campaign for Laura Dern, he was a rich LA character, without whom the city seems that much dimmer.",

That bucket would turn out to be quite a lonely one. The Thunder immediately ripped off a 30-2 run, a rugged sequence that highlighted the qualities that make them so great on both sides of the ball. \nConsider that Oklahoma City lost the first game between these teams in large part because of the opponent's dominant duo of bigs, came into this one even smaller thanks to Isaiah Hartenstein's injury, and yet ran away with the win. The Thunder's lack of size, rather than dooming them, forced them to play compounded Thunderball and in the process showed what makes them special. Watch them work, and you'll see a coherent philosophy unifying the ways they operate on both offense and defense, one built around the drive. It is a philosophy of pressure.",

Their two games were stay-in-your-chair fascinating, even Thursday night's blowout 'Der win, which followed a game eight days earlier in which the Cavs out-delivered OKC. A case can be made that their matchup is the only one that can save a season of ratings regret and regression, and it raises the same questions that were being asked a decade ago:\nCan the NBA thrive with a championship series with two non-marquee teams? More to the point, a bunch of non-marquee players? And finally, why does that matter?",

I'd look at the Los Angeles skyline at whatever shade of yellow-orange-brown muck the fires had delivered that day and take a photo, and then I'd scurry back inside. Against my better judgment, one time I took my mask off for one second and immediately felt ill. The entire city smelled like a funeral pyre.\nBack inside, I would turn on my TV, switch it to a local news station, and leave it on all day. I wouldn't shut it off until a few hours before bed, when my husband and I would watch some scripted TV to unwind—unless the flames were getting a little too close, which only happened once. Local TV news and its updates became the soundtrack of my days, complete with its bright graphics, specific music, and the parade of weary-but-pulling-through-it anchors tossing to extremely awake but often harried live reporters. It was from local TV where I learned where to donate supplies for those who lost everything in the fires. It was on local TV that I—and many Angelenos—learned about a fire in the Hollywood Hills, later dubbed the Sunset Fire, that sparked up Wednesday night and required immediate evacuations in the heart of Hollywood.

It happened early in the second quarter, with the Ravens leading 7-0 and the Steelers facing a third-and-2 from their own 28. Russell Wilson flipped a pass toward the right flat to tight end Pat Freiermuth. Just after the 6-foot-5, 258-pound Freiermuth caught the ball, Ravens safety Ar’Darius Washington—who stands all of 5-8, 180—came smashing into him. Washington proved to be no fly on Freiermuth’s windshield. He quickly brought Freiermuth to the ground just short of the sticks.\nRather than risk failure on fourth-and-1, Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin decided to punt. It goes without saying that this was cowardice, even though it was the Steelers’ inability to gain one yard on back-to-back plays that contributed to the previous week’s loss to the Bengals. ”We have to be able to make routine plays routinely,” Tomlin would later say.",

The text of the cynically titled “Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act” is as vague and confused as the roughly 25 state laws that already ban trans kids from sports, but it remains striking for its scope. This bill applies not just to college-aged athletes, but also to kids as young as kindergarten.\nSupporters of the legislation really, really want you to believe this is all about fairness. It’s in the name of the bill: Banning trans women would protect cis women athletes (somehow). In affirming his support, the California Congressman Doug LaMalfa expressed outrage at the idea that “XY chromosome males” were currently “taking the place of women and girls in sports,” an analysis of the current situation that is just as darkly conspiratorial as it is bogus.",

There are piano-led instrumentals by Greta Morgan (more on her tomorrow) and molly leach. We play two new guitar instrumentals from Blue Lake and SUSS – the latter is an ambient country cover of “This Land Is Your Land.” We get into deeper guitar cuts by Durutti Column, Barry Archive Johnson, and The Deku Trio. We selected three beats from Madlib’s Yesterday’s New Quintet project, and then the mix winds down with dub techno from Porter Ricks and Museum. We hope you enjoy.",
