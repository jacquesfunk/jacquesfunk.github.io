          "description": "There is something bleakly inspiring about the fact that despite the total saturation of sports culture with the brand and business, there appears to be no way to make sports gambling feel like anything but poisonously bad vibes. People are still doing it and sometimes wrecking their lives in the process. The gambling concerns that sit atop the industry are propping up what's left of sports media with their advertising expenditures, and bending coverage toward their own cheesy ends. A government that only grudgingly restrains predatory industries like this one, under the best of circumstances, is not remotely under the best of circumstances. None of this appears to be going anywhere, but it is also not getting any less repellent. Sounds like podcast stuff to me!",

That line of thinking misses a key thing that McCain has in him, which is: That Dog. McCain is a hooper's hooper, and the main aspect of McCain's game that has struck me through the serious hot stretch he's enjoying, aside from the discrete basketball skills he's showing off, is his ironclad mentality. He's operating like he's the best player on the court at all times, which I think is as important for young players adjusting to NBA speed as hitting open shots or making rotations. To belong, you have to believe you belong, and if there's one thing that makes me optimistic McCain will stick, it's his confidence.",

Gruden lost his head coaching job with the Las Vegas Raiders in 2021, after emails in which he used racist, homophobic, and sexist language were leaked to the press. In one of those emails, he wrote that \"Dumboriss Smith has lips the size of michellin tires,\" in reference to then-NFLPA head DeMaurice Smith. Gruden resigned from his position with the Raiders in October 2021, and then popped up the following year, sporting a Mark Davis-lite haircut, to half-heartedly apologize for the things he wrote.\nThat didn't do the trick, so Gruden has spent the last two years coming up with other ideas. He managed to weasel his way into the Kansas City Chiefs' training camp this past summer, but that didn't lead to any jobs. Then he sat down for a profile with CBS Sports in September, in which he revealed that his new goal was to get a job coaching college football. Still, no coaching opportunities materialized, which left Gruden stranded with one final option: content creation.",

I can give you the obvious answers: They're an NHL team playing its first season in Salt Lake City; they're the reanimated corpse of the Arizona Coyotes; they're a company that still hasn't settled on an name for its product. But none of those mean a whole lot in the context of actually watching a game. To fans of other teams, their presence on the schedule remains abstract and unfamiliar—detached from any memories of past experiences. For those in Utah, they're by definition your team, but you don't really know the players yet, haven't gotten used to the rhythm of week-by-week hot and cold streaks. It's like living with a new roommate; you may be open-minded and even optimistic, but there's a lot of blank space left to fill.\nThe Carolina Hurricanes do not have this issue. As they've made the playoffs in six straight years under head coach Rod Brind'Amour, they've established one of the firmest identities in the NHL. With longtime players like Sebastian Aho, Marty Nečas, Andrei Svechnikov, Jordan Staal, and Jaccob Slavin, you know exactly what you're getting when you play the Canes: a team that will do everything they can to maximize shot differential and win by out-possessing their opponents. Utah got the quintessential Canes experience at home on Wednesday night, getting outshot 50-21. But with a statement-making third period that began with fireworks and ended safely in Karel Vejmelka's glove, they picked up an unlikely and inspiring 4-1 win.",

          "description": "For me, seeing a screen in a theater is like seeing a bank logo at Pride. We don’t need that here! This space is about living, breathing, three-dimensional people. And I’m not just talking about the tiny cell-phone screens that light up in the rows around me—though, obviously, put those away. I mean when a Broadway production devotes a chunk of its stage to images of the actors instead of the actors themselves. When I go to the theater, I like to feel myself disappear into the production, and a screen is inherently distancing—a copy of the real thing. Every once in a while, like in Ivo Van Hove’s production of Network, the presence of a screen makes diegetic sense. But mostly, like in Ivo Van Hove’s production of West Side Story, the staging makes you wonder if you should have just gone to an IMAX theater instead—a place where person-to-person empathy is supposed to be subsumed by spectacle. But if any production can make an argument for these screens as experience-enhancers rather than mere shiny toys, it’s Sunset Blvd., the new staging of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, which feels like the trendiest thing to see on Broadway this holiday season.\nWhen the 23-foot LCD screen swung down from the ceiling to magnify Tom Francis’s harried face in the show’s early going, I was a little bit relieved, against my traditionalist instincts. You see, I had one of the worst seats in the house at the St. James Theatre—any farther away and I’d be watching The Hills Of California across the street. And because I was so high up, and could see no details whatsoever of anyone’s face, I appreciated the Jumbotron-esque assistance provided by the compact camera rig Francis held in front of him. But as it kept returning, I was confronted by the inevitable question: Do you look at the real thing, or the larger-than-life thing? It was only at the start of the second act, when that decision was made for the audience, that I could embrace the full extent of the possibility that the Broadway camera offered.",

That it was buried in the late window on a Tuesday night is one of those puzzling decisions that makes a person wonder if the NBA wants the tournament to matter to its bill-paying viewers in the way it hopes the tournament will someday matter to players.\nThere was no way to make this one not matter, though. Warriors-Mavericks was its own electronic billboard, a sure spike in the regular season drone no matter when it was played. Stephen Curry is one of the two pillars of the league's ratings renaissance alongside King James I, and his brilliance has powered the league's last two media rights contracts; Klay Thompson was Curry's left ventricle on a series of near-magical teams that dominated much of the last decade. On Tuesday, they played against each other for the first time since Thompson chose expat status in Dallas with a team that, on paper, seemed to offer a better chance to get him a mood-altering fifth ring than the seemingly aging-out Warriors.",

In one way, we succeeded in doing all these things, because we did do them and time did pass. In another way, failure was a universal constant. When that happens, it is probably not helpful to tell someone that you will scream if you have to hear \"Hallelujah\" on the ukelele one more time. \nBut in the context of a massive crisis where so much is out of your control, what does it mean to be helpful? What is good when the world is upside-down? When the usual compasses stop working, many of us revert to bizarre reflexes and weaponized boredom. And who are we to judge?",

It was a fun one, a back-and-forth 6-3 Jets victory in which Winnipeg showed conclusively they're a cut above, playing relentless, mistake-free hockey behind the league's best forward line and in front of the scariest goalie in the world.\nConnor Hellebuyck vs. Igor Shesterkin was the undercard, pitting two of the last three Vezina winners, and coming at a time when Shesterkin is trying to lap Hellebuyck and every other netminder with his pending contract. The game didn't quite play out as a duel—the Rangers turned the puck over too many times, and the Jets took too many penalties, for this one to feature any brilliant statlines in goal. Hellebuyck saved 33; Shesterskin stopped 27 of 32 for his second straight start allowing five goals.",

          "description": "Fans of chromatically bold hardwood courts rejoice: The NBA's in-season tournament, freshly rebranded as the NBA Cup with a big fancy title sponsor, returned Tuesday night. In both basketball and business terms, last season's inaugural go-round was a success, though there's no guarantee that's a permanent condition. Even if it's bad, it will still be interesting, as the tournament will function as the league intends only if teams and players take it seriously, which requires them to make a series of revealing choices from among a handful of somewhat mutually exclusive options.\nThe NBA tipped the business ambitions of its FA Cup cosplay with the scheduling. Games take place on football-less Tuesdays and Fridays, in the hopes that the relative novelty and theoretically higher stakes will draw in larger audiences of curious casual viewers during the part of the NBA schedule when the games typically matter the least. Of course the NBA wants people to watch the first eighth of the interminable regular season, and the NBA Cup is a significantly more management-friendly alternative to shortening the schedule by the dozen or so games the union has occasionally asked for. If you're not going to engineer significance through scarcity, simply enrich the existing offerings.",

Anywhere from half a million to nine million, depending on who you ask.

Tagovailoa's marketability is complicated, however, by the fact that he recently completed yet another stint on the IR after being concussed in Week 2. Tagovailoa's career, from college to the pros, has been riddled with brain injuries, at such an alarming rate that many pundits were urging him to retire following the hit he took in September. Tagovailoa didn't retire, though, and now he's trying to salvage the Dolphins' season. It's a story worth telling, surely, but how exactly does a network sell the story to fans?",

Every morning, I open the pantry and hunt around for the tub of protein powder. Very often on these hunts, I encounter other, different tubs, tubs and bags of things that look like protein powder but possibly are not, or tubs or bags of things that definitely are not protein powder, but look and smell like they are meant to be dissolved in water and then consumed, for health.

The show, in which she plays the lead character, Sam, loosely depicts Everett’s own life, or at least the one she would have lived if she had stayed in Kansas instead of moving to New York, where she eventually became a downtown alt-cabaret star. If you consider her start getting her equity card around the age of 26, that’s a good two decades to get to the position she is in now, where her show is a Peabody Award winner and she no longer has to wait tables as a fallback. Depending on your perspective, that’s incredibly cool or incredibly nuts.\n“Dreams don’t have deadlines.” The first time I saw Everett say that was in 2017, during an interview for the indie film Patti Cake$, in which she plays the alcoholic mother of a bartender (Danielle Macdonald) who aspires to become a rap star. “There’s a quote from LL Cool J,” Everett tells the young interviewer, laughing, “it’s DDHD—Dreams don’t have deadlines—and I live by that and I think everybody should live by it because it doesn’t matter if you’re 15, you’re 23, or you’re collecting retirement checks, just keep going for what makes you feel happy and follow and live your dream.”",

Boots had the title, the perfect record (32-0 with 29 knockouts), and a one-two combo of out-of-the-ring charm and on-the-job ferocity that put him in any conversation about boxing’s Next Big Thing. The 27-year old Philly native was maybe just one highlight-reel KO away from breathing the rare air that Tank breathes popularity-wise, hitting pay-per-view headliner status and getting what all boxers suddenly covet: An invite to Saudi Arabia.

The four-peating Premier League champions started each of those consecutive title-winning campaigns with whimpers, relatively speaking, dropping at least eight points in Premier League play in each of them by about mid-November. Each of those stretches of (relatively) subpar play gave hope to everyone who supports a fellow title contender or simply (and justifiably) hates City's whole deal. But, as the saying goes, it's the hope that kills you, and City eventually crushed those hopes in each of those four seasons.\nRight on time, the present day Citizens have entered the late-fall point of the schedule mired in a funk. Right now City sits in second place on the league table, having dropped 10 points in its first 11 matches. After a strong start to the campaign, the Mancs have hit the skids hard recently, currently stuck in a four-match losing streak across all competitions.

          "description": "If an accurate quarterback is a comfortable quarterback, then the Texans' pass rush made Jared Goff play like he was wearing cleats filled with Christmas tree needles for most of Sunday's night contest against the Lions. A one-loss signal-caller who entered Houston on a record pace for completion percentage, who hadn't thrown a ball to the wrong-colored jerseys since Week 3, looked without warning like a Lions QB from the old days, completing a season-low 50 percent of his 30 passes while tossing an increasingly confounding five interceptions as his boys trailed by as much as 23-7 in the second half. Still, all was forgiven in the end, as some Texan mistakes, a refocused offense, and a couple of clutch kicks all combined to deliver Detroit an inspiring comeback—26-23, with a walk-off field goal for the win. \nMost of what you need to know about Detroit's offense is this: In their one loss this season, Week 2 vs. Tampa Bay, Goff threw the ball 55 times. In all other games leading into their primetime clash against Houston, he'd maxed out at 28. The two prongs that allow this offense to plug into a power source are running backs David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs, and their punishing runs behind a fearsome offensive line are what open up opportunities for Goff to find his receivers on play-action pass plays. But the Texans' pressure in the early going both suffocated the run and forced Goff into uncharacteristic errors. On the game's opening drive, an energetic deflection by Jalen Pitre created a Jimmie Ward interception, and with the Lions down 13-7 in the second, Denico Autry got his hand on Goff while he threw and sparked a tip frenzy that eventually led to another Texans field goal. Detroit proceeded to go three-and-out on each of the next two drives, as Houston's aggression disrupted Goff's rhythm and refused to give him clear looks at his targets.",

The iced coffee in my hand proved unwieldy as I scanned my ballot, the poll worker’s hands fluttering nervously nearby. By the time I completed my civic duty, I still had most of my coffee left, along with a mostly free afternoon.

It was the kind of day that tricks everyone into believing they like summer in New York, except it was early November. My face and legs began to prick with heat as I settled onto a park bench and lit a joint. A pickup basketball game unfolded before me. A group of teens gossiped at a table nearby, shedding their black puffer jackets as the sun's warmth intensified. I remembered a wish I’d made earlier that year, that this fall would be the most beautiful I’d ever witnessed. I wondered if it was a curse. In a group chat with my best friends, one of them, a culture editor at the New Yorker, said, “I hate to say this and I want to be wrong but I kind of think he’s going to win.” My legs began to burn; I pulled a book out of my bag, my jacket over my knees.",

They would have seen what people watching at home did not, which was those fans throwing a bunch of garbage from the seats and onto the field while officials reviewed a Colorado sack that involved both a facemask penalty that was not called and a targeting infraction that first was, and then was overturned. While Dean Blandino explained to the TV audience what was happening, his traditional more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger tone was overtaken by something that sounded more like a Muppet that had been stuffed into a dryer against its will. That was McGuire, and he wanted everyone to knock it off.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTAMqZDCh1Y",

You can't fully live there because there's nowhere to cook or sleep, but you can decorate it however you like. This space is not and cannot really ever be home, and also it is not even really safe—there are always sketchy guys letting themselves in and going through your stuff, grabbing at your wallet, constantly issuing what are very clearly threats in the form of insulting advice. There is a screen you can watch, but it mostly just shows commercials in a little box surrounded by tickers and betting lines and blaring chyrons lousy with incomprehensible AI babble, things that are shaped like words but are not.
