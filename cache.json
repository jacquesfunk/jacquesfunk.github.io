          "description": "Jimmy Carter was a good dude.\nBack to me: In the summer of 2023, I pitched a story about Jimmy Carter outliving his hospice welcome. Carter, the former president who died Sunday at 100 years old, had been in hospice for about six months when I made my pitch, and somehow seemed to be getting stronger in palliative care. I’d lived long enough and had enough personal experience with hospice to know that dying is the most stressful situation you’ll ever inflict on those around you. I hadn’t personally known any hospice enrollee to live anywhere near that long after going in; the lengthiest hospice stay I knew about was my buddy’s dad who lasted just under two weeks, and even that left the family feeling so beaten down they’d have all volunteered to put a pillow over his head to get it over with. Carter’s six-month run seemed downright cruel.",

          "description": "Hats are a relatively indiscriminate fashion choice. For starters, you can buy them at gas stations, when we all know the only things you buy at gas stations are gas and Tic-Tacs to combat the taste of the gas. There is no real standard for owning or wearing a hat as long as the owner has a head, just as long as it isn't a visor. Visors are the most pointless of affectations, as George Carlin pointed out decades ago and Steve Spurrier ran into the ground. Visors aren't hats. Visors are a board with a strap on the back. The only way a visor could be a worse idea is if the wearer were actually bald.\nEverything else from toques to berets to the nattiest or rattiest ballcap are on fashion scholarship, as they work as both a utilitarian and fashion choice depending on the logo on the front—except the Yankees and Red Sox. As Comrade Xu pointed out, those are enforced choices based on lack of selection. The wearer can rise or fall based on the logo involved (extra credit for old, defunct teams like the Montreal Expos or Fort Wayne Kekiongas), but the base line is \"fine, whatever.\"",

          "description": "It was a concerning year. WWE continued to enlarge and enrich itself even as it failed to honestly reckon with the legacy of Vince McMahon. AEW—once an avatar of hope and change—took a creative and cultural nosedive. The Japanese scene is economically hamstrung and can't keep its top talents from moving to the States. It all combined for perhaps the worst non-COVID year for a wrestling fan since the widespread adoption of internet streaming. I look around and I crave a spark—an inspiring rivalry like Kobashi-Misawa, Punk-Joe, or Omega-Okada that lights a better path forward.\nWith that pessimism in mind, I picked 10 matches from 10 promotions this year, instead of the 15 I struggled to narrow down in 2022 and 2023. But I liked them, and I think you should check them out, because I got out of them what I still get out of great wrestling: excitement, astonishment, joy. Here they are, in chronological order:",

          "description": "I stopped drinking alcohol in June 2023, a decision that was long overdue and has since improved my life unconditionally—congratulations to me! And yet stopping drinking did in no way quench my urge to drink, because that's not how addiction works. In fact, I felt thirstier than ever and fiending for something to glug at a bar or a house party and pretend I was still a younger, more foolish version of myself. So I turned to mocktails, because that's what was increasingly advertised on the menus and on the subways and in a slew of articles and books. People were paying $14 for a Phony Negroni® at the shadowy pizza place down the street, so why shouldn't I?\nMy first foray in mocktails happened in 2016, during a six-month dry spell when I was on a course of the acne drug Accutane. The dive bars I went to with friends didn't yet have a trendy fleet of non-alcoholic drinks, and I was mostly too scared to make a bartender feel put upon by asking for an off-the-menu mocktail. (I did try this once in an attempt to flirt with the bartender and promptly received a Shirley Temple, which I didn't not enjoy but also made me feel like a child with no game.) Sodas were a no-go because of the caffeine, and plain seltzer made me wonder if bubbles were worth paying up to $3 for water. After some trial and error, I settled on a DIY mocktail I called spicy drink: I'd order seltzer with pineapple juice and douse it with hot sauce that I carried in my bag. The resulting concoction was sweet and sizzly, vaguely reminiscent of some of my favorite tequila drinks, although I would never serve it to anyone else. I made it work with spicy drink because I knew in a few months I'd be back in the saddle, reunited with my beloved tequila soda.",

          "description": "When Greg Gumbel was named host of the CBS NFL pregame show in 1990, he was viewed as a departure for the network. Brent Musberger had been host of The NFL Today for the past 15 years, and a lot of people were tired of his shtick. He dominated the show, and much of the network's sports coverage. Reporters wondered whether Gumbel, who had previously called NFL games and hosted NCAA men’s basketball tournament coverage for CBS, would be another preempting pregame personality.\nHe wasn’t, instead guiding the show in a lower key. Gumbel hosted in the studio with Terry Bradshaw, while Lesley Visser and Pat O’Brien handled features. The new host wanted to be the conductor, not the star. “If Terry stars on that show,” Gumbel told the AP right before starting, “then I’ll have done my job.”",

He got there in time, but his pants got him into trouble: Jeans are not allowed, per the International Chess Federation's dress code.
