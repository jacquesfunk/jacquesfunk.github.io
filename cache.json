Not for reasons of miserliness or whatever; I simply live in a spooky-looking (at night) log cabin at the end of a very long and dark driveway branching off of a winding and hilly forest road in a low-density area. If any trick-or-treaters have visited my home in the seven Halloweens I've lived here, they were very small, dressed very convincingly as squirrels and raccoons, and left without knocking on the door.\nI've had occasion, nevertheless, to form Halloween candy opinions and judgments in that time, from taking my own kids trick-or-treating. Raising kids in an area (\"neighborhood\" would be inappropriate, here; it's just a road with some houses alongside) where trick-or-treating basically does not happen, you learn where the good nearby trick-or-treating districts are, and you travel to them. This means that pretty much by definition, for the past seven years my kids have trick-or-treated on Halloween only in places known to be especially good for the practice, where there are lots of decorated houses, lots of costumed trick-or-treaters, and lots of friendly people giving out lots of candy.",

Sure, I could come up with a reason for a day trip to say, Collingswood or Haddonfield, but that hardly felt legitimate enough to forfeit the mystique. Judging by the dress of the people who left the stations, PATCO served commuters; when I eventually rode the PATCO Speedline, it should be to commute.\nI'll admit, I was appalled when the prospect of a Defector Atlantic City retreat cropped up. But while Atlantic City offered to my colleagues sportsbooks and blackjack and craps and a sense of glamour, it offered me something much less sick in the head: an opportunity to ride a new and mysterious transit line.

The haunted are almost always from the north of England, except for the ones in post-World War II Tokyo. They are obsessive and prone to paranoia, as the haunted tend to be; their self-destructive streaks are galvanic and inescapable. The worse things get—things always get worse—the hauntings become propulsive, dissociative experiences. It’s fitting that the late Mark Fisher, high priest of Hauntology, was a big fan. “You are not living with the dead. You are living with the living,” Philip Roth wrote in Sabbath’s Theater. Peace’s characters aren’t afforded such merciful clarity. As one of the many disordered minds in 1977 muses repeatedly: \n“This is why people die.\nThis is why.”\nThis is why people.",

          "description": "Japanese RPGs (JRPGs for short) do a lot of things right, but one thing they are not particularly known for is respecting the player's time. Whereas Western AAA games like Horizon: Zero Dawn, Assassin's Creed, or even the newer Legend of Zelda entries, pad their runtimes with open-world shenanigans, JRPGs usually earn their 100-plus hour runtimes the old-fashioned way: with a slow pace, lots of cutscenes and dialog, and grinding monsters for experience. At times, playing a JRPG can feel like watching a particularly engaging anime, if during every commercial break had you complete a puzzle or fight a monster before getting back to the show.\nMetaphor: ReFantazio (let's get this out of the way: the name is dumb) isn't immune to this, especially at the beginning. The newest game from Japanese developer Atlus, makers of the Persona series as well as the more hardcore Shin Megami Tensei series, is a bit of a slow burn. Like their breakthrough masterpiece Persona 5 before it, the first couple of hours of Metaphor are an extended tutorial, which in practice boils down to doing scripted fights in between grand cutscenes that lay out the setting.",

Smugglers stow these artifacts, or even the wildlife themselves, inside large shipping containers, which are too expensive and time-consuming to scan with an X-ray. To help sleuth out these objects, scientists at the Belgian nonprofit Anti-persoonsmijnen ontmijnende product ontwikkeling (which roughly translates to Anti-Personnel Landmines Removal Product Development, or APOPO in Flemish) are turning to a rat with an extraordinary sense of smell. Giant African pouched rats have been trained to sniff out landmines in the ground, tuberculosis in mucus samples, and even survivors in disaster zones. Can the eight trained rats of APOPO—Marty, Attenborough, Irwin, Betty, Teddy, Ivory, Ebony, and Fossey—rise to the occasion, and help stave off their neighbors' endangerment, or even extinction? We sat down with Ivory, who lives in the town of Morogoro in Tanzania, to learn about the smell of poaching, her itty-bitty uniform, and what kind of treats she likes most as a reward; here's how she gets it done.\nOn carving her own path:",

You won't see any of that in Red Rooms, a French-Canadian psychological thriller directed by Pascal Plante, which does not feature any gore or violence. But it begins with something that is perhaps worse: A thorough description, even more detailed than the one I provided above, of the snuff films at the center of its plot. The descriptions are delivered to a silent courtroom, by a prosecutor who is trying a man named Ludovic Chevalier (Maxwell McCabe-Lokos) for the murder of three teen girls.

If you are going to begin a game by running a lob for one of the two best shotblockers in the NBA against the other, the most important thing to do is make you sure you drag that guy away from the rim. The Spurs did the right thing, shearing Holmgren from the ballhandler with one screen and impeding his path to the rim with a second, but by the time Jeremy Sochan lofted the pass, it was too late: Holmgren took flight and spiked the ball off the glass, then blocked the follow-up from Sochan.

That's not to dismiss his overall postseason contributions—he had an uneventful World Series, and an amusing stretch of only getting clutch hits, but considering the sample size his numbers pan out as perfectly respectable, if not to expectation. Then again, the expectation was Ohtani's typical narrative inevitability. Something like, say, in the very first game of the NLDS, when the Dodgers were down three runs in the second inning, and Ohtani smashed a high fastball from Padres ace Dylan Cease to tie the game in one swing. After six seasons without postseason Ohtani, suddenly there he was.\nNone of the other postseason days had quite the same feel as the first, due to a combination of Ohtani's aforementioned perfectly respectable struggles and the Dodgers' postseason tendency to win or lose games by large margins. But even when Ohtani wasn't getting on base, he had presence. For one, there was that broadcast graphic counting down the batters until he would arrive at the plate. Then there was the shoulder injury scare. And because Ohtani is Ohtani, even his failures had import. In the fifth inning of the Dodgers' series-clinching Game 5, Gerrit Cole struck out Ohtani's fellow 80 FV prospect Gavin Lux with the bases loaded. Fine: It's Gavin Lux. But then Cole struck out Ohtani, and that meant something. It's a simple truism—big players make big moments feel bigger—but, well, there you have it.",

The cosmic scriptwriters, working within the boundaries imposed by Bronny's limitations as a basketball player, did their best. It was never going to be a significant bucket in the story of a basketball game, because Bronny isn't very good and the Lakers are, or certainly intend to be. The setting was nice, though: The bucket came in the fourth quarter of a road game against Bronny's hometown Cavaliers, in the only visit his Lakers will make to Cleveland this regular season. It so happened that the Lakers, off to an otherwise encouraging 3–1 start under new head coach and dynamic podcaster J.J. Redick, were in the process of getting comprehensively pantsed by the home team, leaving Bronny to handle the bad kind of mop-up duties. \nBronny checked into the game with just over five minutes left in the fourth quarter, to a loud \"Bron-ny\" chant from welcoming Cavs fans, who by that point had been calling for him on and off for about three straight minutes of game action. The buzz continued, crescendoing whenever Bronny touched the ball over the next few Lakers possessions. Then, with about 2:15 left on the clock, Bronny pushed the ball down to the Cleveland baseline, retreated a few steps, jabbed as if to use a screen toward the middle of the court, and pulled up for a contested mid-ranger. The noise in the arena suggested a playoff game, including a huge pop when the shot fell.",

Particularly in this World Series, which the Dodgers wrapped triumphantly on Wednesday night, all of those synonyms were put to good use in each game.\nTo wit: In Game 1, Freddie Freeman's walk-off big fly made him an instant legend. In Game 2, L.A. won on the strength of a tater from Tommy Edman, a bomb from Teoscar Hernández, and a round-tripper from Freeman. In Game 3, the difference-maker once more was a Freeman dong. In Game 4, the Yankees got a morale boost from an Anthony Volpe grand salami. And in Game 5, New York was off and running early thanks to a jack from Aaron Judge, a blast from Jazz Chisholm, and a Giancarlo Stanton pancake to right.

They were still pretty good in 2012, which was Andre Ethier's last good season, Chad Billingsley's last healthy one, and Kenley Jansen's first as a full-time closer. They improved from 86 to 92 wins in 2013 and have not been below 91 wins or out of the playoffs in any full season since. They won just one World Series in that stretch, and it was both fully earned—the Dodgers had an absurd .712 winning percentage when they won the version of the World Series that ended the plague-warped mini-season of 2020—and somehow not really an outlier. The Dodgers won 111 games in 2022, for an equally absurd .715 winning percentage, and that team didn't survive the NLDS. The Phillies team that made it through to the World Series that year won 87.\nIt doesn't feel quite right to say that the Dodgers were cheated out of World Series wins during any of those years, with the possible exception of the semi-year in which they actually won it. They have been in the postseason for nearly a decade and a half, and have during that time become the model organization in the sport—as astute and farsighted as the most financially optimized franchises, as detail-oriented and forward-thinking as the most development-oriented, richer and more ambitious than just about any other team in the sport, and exactly as cynical as everyone else. It would have been strange if the Dodgers didn't win a World Series somewhere in there, although it wouldn't have felt quite right—it wouldn't have been appropriately October-coded or appropriately Dodgers—if it wasn't a little stupid when it finally happened.",

          "description": "\"That's crazy, I can't believe that—who is that guy?\" Dwyane Wade asked the crowd Sunday at the unveiling of his bronze statue in front of the Miami Heat's arena. Who is that guy, indeed. Was Wade a Frasier superfan brought in to celebrate the lifetime achievements of Kelsey Grammer? Was it perhaps a monument to Matrix-era Laurence Fishburne? In time, scholars were able to discern the artists' intent: to commemorate Wade's classic \"This is my house\" celebration atop a courtside table after a double-overtime game-winner over the Bulls in March 2009.\nThe statue's posture and garments are mostly true to that iconic Wade moment—he was wearing the El Heat jersey the night of the game-winner, though that's within the bounds of artistic license. The face, less so. That bold massif of a jawline is disorienting when viewed straight on, but it's somewhat more Wade-like when seen from other vantage points. In any case, it was red meat for the Inside the NBA crew on Tuesday's broadcast. Kenny Smith insisted that it looked like Wade, just \"making an animated face.\"",

Even after Tuesday's 11-4 victory by the New York Yankees, the series still seems beyond dramaturgy's reach. A 3-1 series lead is more full of waiting than proper suspense, and so there’s only so much to anticipate.

The former lifeguard had been a showman on the Atlantic City boardwalk at various locations, and in 1906 opened his showpiece amusement pier in what was then an up-and-coming New Jersey resort city.\n“His twice-daily, deep-sea net hauls were famous, attracting thousands of wide-eyed tourists,” Nelson Johnson writes in Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times And Corruption of Atlantic City. “Wearing knickers, an old sweater and cap, he was a wiry and weathered, red-faced man with sparkling blue eyes, reminiscent of a leprechaun. As he lowered the net to the floor of the pier, Young went into his routine of identifying the sea animals he had caught. It was an animated performance that mesmerized his customers.”",

This is a club that has won 27 La Liga trophies, five Champions Leagues, a sextuple, you name it. Two wins in four days is great, and doubly so when considering the opposition, but it's still only October, and there are no ticker-tape parades under the Arc de Triomf in October. Nevertheless, Barcelona really needed this exact week, with these exact results, in its efforts to shake off the doldrums that have haunted it in its post–Lionel Messi haze, and at last inaugurate a new era worthy of the best of the old ones.\nThe week from heaven started in the Champions League on Oct. 23. Barcelona had started this newly formatted tournament with a wet fart, losing 2-1 to Monaco in the opener after Eric García got himself sent off in the 10th minute. Though a 5-0 drubbing of Swiss side Young Boys followed, the level of the opposition meant the match was more or less useless in determining what the ceiling of first-year manager Hansi Flick's new-look, refreshed, but still unproven side was going to be. The first serious test came last Wednesday at the hands of Bayern Munich, and it's safe to say Barcelona aced it.",

I had confidence that I wouldn't be tempted to gamble, but I knew casinos and their ilk were dens of trickery, structured to trap you into semi-consciously giving them whole wads of cash.

According to Folkenflik's reporting, the paper's billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, reviewed a draft of the endorsement before Lewis announced that the Post would not be endorsing a candidate this year. Some Post staffers, faced with their publication's owner meddling in editorial decisions, revolted. A few published articles criticizing management's decision to nix the endorsement, while others submitted letters of resignation. A much bigger and more damaging reaction came from outside the paper: According to Folkenflik, at least 200,000 people have cancelled their digital subscriptions to the Post since the publication of Lewis's editorial, a number that represents roughly eight percent of the paper's paid circulation.",

But that is not what I am here to discuss. I am here to discuss the creatures.\nAs soon as I glimpsed the dark tunnel of vines that connects the Rainforest Cafe gift shop to the Rainforest Cafe restaurant, a threshold I had not crossed since my halcyon days, a question began buzzing in my mind: Which rainforest is the Rainforest Cafe supposed to be? Of course, the most obvious candidate would be the Amazon, the world's only A-List rainforest.

Neither the Dodgers nor the Yankees chalk up kindly on the moral scale of historic suffering, but, on paper, they can make up for it by promising entertainment for the masses: a powerhouse vs. powerhouse match-up laden with stars. What, then, to make of the fact that one of the purported powerhouses not only currently resembles an ant, but one of those types of ant whose primary defense mechanism is literally exploding?\nAfter falling to a 2-0 series deficit to the Dodgers to open the World Series, the Yankees spent their first game at home making their eventual 4-2 loss feel like a blowout. Now, as per the laws of arithmetic, the Yankees are down 3-0. The sweep alarms are going off! The spaceship is steering itself directly into the sun! The Dodgers have continued getting their postseason success from relatively unexpected corners. The \"Three Batters Away\"-style FOX chyrons for Shohei Ohtani (though also used for other stars, such as Juan Soto and Bryce Harper) weren't paying off even before people started making slow-motion videos of Ohtani's backpack-wearing range of motion.
