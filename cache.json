O'Keefe, one of the more baroquely damaged defectives in reactionary media, is destroying less notable lives now than he did during the years when the videos he produced led to the resignations of NPR executives and the collapse of the activist organization ACORN, but his rancid body of work is compelling proof that the destruction is something like its own reward for him.\nO'Keefe's taste in enemies has never been especially creative, which reflects both what vintage of conservative he is—vain, pretentious, and relentlessly aggrieved, with strong notes of metro-NYC suburbia psychosis on the finish—and the business that he's in. Project Veritas, which O'Keefe built by crafting videos that exposed various conservative culture-war enemies in ways built to fit their laziest media caricatures, was a nonprofit business supported by rich conservatives, and so generally aimed to scratch the recurring itches of those old, dull, nasty people. Sometimes, as with ACORN, O'Keefe got the results he sought. Mostly, he succeeded in helping people whose politics revolve around being scandalized and upset remain in their desired state of agitation, and in raising money from them to help with his many lawsuits.",

          "description": "Somewhere on the seafloor of an oceanic canyon near Vancouver Island in 2022, scientists dropped a bundle of video and audio recording gear and a carousel loaded with 24 bottles. Each bottle contained a hefty sardine bathed in vegetable oil, and the carousel was programmed to release one sardine every two weeks to attract the deep-sea fish skulking in the area. The muddy bottom served as stomping grounds for sleek sablefish, noodly eelpouts and hagfish, and flabby snailfish, all of whom roam in nearly absolute darkness, aside from glimmers of bioluminescence.\nAt more than 2,000 feet deep, the observatory one of many deep-sea observatories set up by Ocean Networks Canada, all capturing real-time data of creatures living in the area. The researchers wanted to learn if the fish in the canyon behaved differently around bait in the presence of artificial lights. \"Some are attracted, and some avoid it,\" Héloïse Frouin-Mouy, a marine biologist and bio-acoustician specializing in marine mammals at the University of Miami, wrote in an email. The observatory had both video and acoustic cameras to monitor the behavior of fish with the lights on and off.",

My 20s, for all their excitement and over-the-topness, are one big blur of noise, brunch, and credit card debt. But there is just the tiniest section of my heart, a roped off VIP section, where I feel the pangs of youth pull at me. And more often then not, it is triggered whenever I revisit what I believe to be the best rap project of the 2010s.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/YVzZPNyC4K4?feature=shared",

Just write 50,000 words over the course of 30 days—a rate of roughly 1,700 words a day. Anyone age 13 or older can take part, which is perhaps why my first introduction to what its adherents call NaNoWriMo came through Tumblr, where every November 1 seemingly half of my dashboard disappeared overnight.  \nFor 30 days and 30 nights, my mutuals tinkered away at their novels (and then snuck back onto Tumblr to complain about how hard that tinkering was). They asked me to yell at them if I saw them posting. And then, one by one, they gave up their novels and returned to replenishing my feeds with One Direction GIFs and essays on colonialism in the Avatar: The Last Airbender universe. Over time I got the impression that NaNoWriMo was more of a community-building enterprise than a pure literary one. I was never tempted to take part myself. Mostly out of laziness, but I was also never quite convinced that any novel I wrote in a month could be very good. And I had trouble swallowing the concept of participating in something as heinously named as NaNoWriMo.",

          "description": "I’m not sure Adam Sandler is capable of doing a bad set. Four decades into his career, I think he might be too much of a pro. Asking him to do stand-up badly would be like asking a master carpenter to make a chair badly. The work, after all those years, comes so naturally that doing it wrong would actually be harder. In his new stand-up special, Adam Sandler: Love You, it’s there in the title, that kind of glib “of course” quality—the dismissive way you say “love you” to a parent is the way you say it to Adam Sandler. Like, come on, of course.\nAt a breezy one hour and 14 minutes, Love You is directed by Josh Safdie, the same guy who co-directed Sandler in Uncut Gems, and it opens with the same blue-lit, rain-drenched noir grit Safdie’s so good at coughing up, though perhaps this one rides less on frenetic anxiety than bustle. Nicolette Larson croons her 1978 hit “Lotta Love,” as Sandler, in full beard and sweats, appears behind a cracked windshield, driving up to an alley full of autograph seekers and entering a dive of a venue crowded with people with too many demands and too little time to have them honored (you might recognize a few of the non-actors Safdie used in Gems here). Various elements of the stage are falling apart, the monitors don’t work, and a dog shows up at one point—it’s a mess. It’s a cute contradictory conceit, the image of a journeyman comedian who is still willing to play a shithole (“Who booked this place?”) for the love of it, reminiscent of Sandler’s lifelong swindler in Gems. Except this is also one of the most famous comedians in the world worth many multiple millions—he’s signing Happy Gilmore jerseys backstage in this, his second Netflix special—no one would dare give this guy the wrong sweetener unless it was scripted.",

          "description": "Isaiah Likely's toe-and-a-shade-more, in and of itself and ever so slightly over the line at the back of the end zone, does not have the same historical import of, say, Kevin Durant's in the 2021 Eastern Conference semifinals. The Baltimore Ravens have 16 more games to prove their worth while those Brooklyn Nets went right to powersuck in a heartbeat, and by extension the Ravens could still affirm Lamar Jackson's place somewhere near the top of the universe. Observing the NFL has been reduced by its simpleton punditocracy to quarterbacks plus some other stuff, because the game itself is apparently too involved to make us think about more than just the one position. Every now and then, though, a big tight end’s big toe can be momentarily significant.\nThe NFL’s rolling Chief Show was not what the audience wanted from Thursday night's season opener. It wanted Likely to have both feet fully inside the white paint so that the compelling game everyone received could go on a little bit longer. Probably not that much longer—even in that universe where Likely, the Ravens' Kelce-in-training, gets credit for the touchdown he surely had scored, the Ravens probably push it all in on a two-point conversion try that either wins or loses the game. That would have been an act of starkest clarity that made people think more fondly of Ravens head coach John Harbaugh, but it is also academic. The good news was that last night’s game was so compelling that we would have signed up for 10 more minutes of it. The bad news was that it ended in anticlimax. Likely's toe was a quarter-inch too prominent and so a spectacular denouement shriveled to referee Shaun Hochuli declaring that Likely's heroics weren't heroics at all, and that everyone would have to clear the stadium and their living rooms. It was that rare case where virtually all of America’s unaffiliated millions of viewers would have preferred the incorrect call.",

These episodes are always a little longer than usual, and always somewhat rushed once things start bogging down around the AFC South. You may know its rhythms by now, too.

Hiring more journalists to cover women's soccer and men's lacrosse is a big win for the sports and for readers, and ESPN should reap the benefits of increased reporting by—oh no oh god it's yet another bullshit AI pivot.\nRead that quote in the first paragraph again: ESPN wants to \"enhance coverage of underserved sports,\" but is not going to pay real human beings to do this. Instead, it will \"leverage Microsoft AI technology\" to autogenerate game recaps. But don't worry, a human editor will be on hand to check each recap for \"quality and accuracy,\" because at least the brass at ESPN knows the slop AI is best known for producing. As an example: In the original tweet from ESPN Front Row, the AI-generated recap meant to showcase the feature got the Washington Spirit's record wrong.

The two players' collective journey back to the same board in a high-stakes match is not quite as enthralling as their incendiary bickering match of two years ago, though they've walked rather circuitous paths back here.\nWe'll start with Carlsen, as his life has been far simpler than Niemann's over the past two years. Shortly after the Niemann affair, Carlsen officially ceded the title of world champion, an honor he'd held for a decade, to Ding Liren. Ding defeated former Carlsen challenger Ian Nepomniatchi in 2023, a few months before Carlsen stormed to the 2023 Chess World Cup title. He then won and defended the rapid and blitz world championships, and there's not any debate about whether or not he remains the best player in the world. His prep for this month's tournament included playing nine 3+0 games against Ediz Gurel, one of the youngest grandmasters in the world. He won eight of them, despite Gurel putting up a good fight.",

On the surface, it's a little odd. The 26-year-old might be the best ball-striker of his American cohort, and he's physically transformed himself into a competent mover, after starting his career as a tottering presence with feet that seemed to fly out from underneath him without warning.",

          "description": "After moving back to Philadelphia as an adult with expendable income, I made a couple of declarations about how if anyone ever decided to open a place that did Chinese breakfast how I liked it, I would keep it afloat myself. This was silly for multiple reasons. To begin with, starting in high school, I made a habit of exchanging breakfast for 20 minutes of extra sleep, and have mostly kept it ever since. Even more embarrassingly, there already existed a place in Philly that offered all the accoutrements of my ideal breakfast, one that I had even been inside—only I'd made the mistake of thinking that it was purely a bakery joint and limited myself to snacks: sesame balls, the like.\nThe place is called Heung Fa Chun Sweet House, between Arch and Cherry on 10th St., but this isn't a restaurant review. Like you need me to tell you that it's good, or cheap, or that the interior layout is some humble affair, when the point at hand here is that I spent a full year hankering on about \"really craving some 油條 right now, man I could really go for some 油條 right now,\" not knowing that I could get some 油條 posthaste with only two ounces of further research—or, say, looked at the menu on the wall when I entered. But if you were, hypothetically, going to find yourself at Heung Fa Chun Sweet House, or any other place that has my three necessary breakfast pillars, here is what to order.",

Skinks have no discernible neck and squat little legs. Their heads are shaped like cones and their tails are long and tapered. They have smooth, overlapping scales, like a fish. As far as appearances go, they are a predictable bunch of lizards.\nBut there is one funky group of skinks in—you guessed it—Australia that have bucked skink convention and evolved some relatively unorthodox bodies. Now, a group of researchers have published a paper in Current Biology explaining exactly how these weird skinks got so weird. \"They have some really kind of extreme morphologies, things that I would kind of say are bizarre,\" said Ian Brennan, an evolutionary biologist at the Natural History Museum in London and the Australian National University in Canberra. \"But it's not really fair to call them bizarre, I guess.\"",

          "description": "At Barcelona, hell is other players. There is no time when the abject state of the club is more apparent than during the transfer window, when Barça, with the help of its media parrots, sells to its perpetually gullible supporters fantasies of lavish spending sprees to bring in the biggest of names. The fantasies are often unrealistic at best and dangerous at worst in light of the club's teetering finances, which still haven't recovered from the time when Barcelona actually did have cash to splash, and did so so extravagantly and fruitlessly that the club damn near drowned. In its efforts to make good on the self-generated hype, the club, again with the help of the parrots, attempts to alienate much of its existing squad, who upon joining were themselves sold a dream of being a key cog in the resurrection of a great club, only to be callously shunted off into the unwanted list and pressured into leaving town.\nThe players Barça winds up signing, after scaring up funds by finding new Peters to rob to keep the Pauls away, are typically underwhelming and ill-suited to address the squad's shortcomings, so much so that even on the day of their unveiling you know you're only a window or two away from them too being lumped atop the discard pile. It's only when the transfer window shuts, the fantasies are dispelled, the disappointment becomes solid and inert, and the roster is more or less set, that Barça fans are spared direct confrontation with all that is ugly with the club as a whole and can begin to find whatever enjoyment there is in the team itself.",

          "description": "It was hardly a mystery to anyone familiar with any of the parties involved, but the last moments of Tuesday night's game between the Dodgers and Angels was precisely why the Dodgers committed a billion dollars to Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts. It's good business, because these are good players, but it's a nice ancillary benefit that doing so was guaranteed to make Ron Washington cry and Arte Moreno to re-re-revisit his decision not to sell the Los Angeles Angels. And so it did.\nBut let's provide the minimal context you expect from us. It was the top of the 10th inning, in a 2-2 game between the Dodgers and their exact opposites from down the highway; Washington had just spent his ridiculous bullpen heat-bringer Ben Joyce to escape the ninth inning, which ended with a swing and a miss on a fastball traveling at 105.5 miles per hour. For the tenth, Washington had to bring in Roansy Contreras, whose particular hell is that he has earned his MLB pension as a Pirate and Angel. Tommy Edman had been dropped at second base as the discourtesy runner, which left Contreras to navigate the bottom three hitters in the Dodgers order. Easy enough, we suppose, because the one thing Contreras (and definitely Washington) needed not to happen was to have to face Ohtani with an open base.",

But while the springtail is certainly plump, it is not an insect but a hexapod—a member of a class of arthropods that include the aptly named two-pronged bristletails and the inconsiderately named coneheads. Springtails are also aptly named, for their ability to leap into the sky to avoid being eaten, smushed, or any of the other fates that might await a creature the size of a chia seed.\nSpringtails generally come in three shapes: some look like roly-polies and others have have elongated bodies, built like a wiener or a brat. The last group are the globular springtails, which are \"dumpy in shape,\" write two researchers from Virginia Tech in a pamphlet. These bulbous bodies are no barrier to the springtail's high-flying gymnastics. Globular springtails can jump so high and so quickly that they appear, almost miraculously, to vanish.",

          "description": "Strictly speaking, many of baseball's starting pitchers have more pitches in their arsenals than they need. I'm not complaining! Take Shota Imanaga, the delightful 31-year-old rookie southpaw for the Chicago Cubs: Statcast says Imanaga has used eight distinct pitch types this season, including a four-seam fastball that he's thrown a whopping 53 percent of the time, and a slow curve that he's thrown exactly once. His pitch profile is a hoot: Overwhelmingly Imanaga relies on a combination of the four-seamer and a deadly splitter, effective against righties and lefties, but then there are six whole other damn pitches—two more than Luis Castillo has in his entire repertoire—that Imanaga throws just here and there, evidently whenever he is feeling zany. This is how you know starting pitchers are artists, or mad scientists, or both.\nPaul Skenes, flame-throwing phenom and rookie ace of the Pittsburgh Pirates, has a changeup. I'm not totally sure I knew that. Skenes has thrown over 700 fastballs this season, but entering Tuesday's start against the Chicago Cubs he'd thrown the changeup just 60 times. Like Imanaga, Skenes has a combination of go-to pitches that, when it's working, tends to be overwhelming. His fastball is, of course, terrifying, and the dreaded splinker, an average of five miles per hour slower than the heater, is a diving, sliding, vanishing nightmare against which MLB hitters are slugging just .248. A changeup is a more complicated offering, something a lot of pitchers have to feel around for early in a start; Skenes can just rear back and hurl the splinker, and for good measure he's got his choice of three effective breaking pitches. The changeup is in Skenes's toolkit what a hand-cranked sausage maker has turned out, regrettably, to be in mine: A fun but clunky thing to play with, which might not be used more than a handful of times between now and 2050.",
