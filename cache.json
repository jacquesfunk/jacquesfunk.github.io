          "description": "Jim Harbaugh has this look about him that screams dotty uncle—the blinky eyes behind the old-man glasses, the slightly slack jaw, the refusal to employ the newfangled play-sheet-and-face-shield look. He's perfectly cast for a man who thinks Lawrence Welk is the cutting edge.\nThus, it was right and proper that he be the one to return the fair catch kick to our notice by stealing a last-second three-banger right before halftime of last night's Amazonapalooza in which Harbaugh's Los Angeles Chargers defeated the almost as old but not nearly so physically arresting Sean Payton and the Denver Broncos. An arcane enclave of the rulebook which was successfully employed as recently as 1976, when Harbaugh was spiritually already in his mid-40s, the fair catch kick can be employed only on a fair catch as time expires, or a penalty on a fair catch, which the Broncos' Tremon Smith gifted the Chargers on a punt that Derius Davis tried to collect with no time left on the clock. The 15-yard penalty took the ball from the Charger 38 to the Bronco 47 and offered an untimed play to provide the punishment for the penalty that would otherwise go unpunished—why, you could hear the oldey-timey gears in a million old coaches' heads at the possibilities. “It’s my favorite rule in football,” Harbaugh said.",

          "description": "Babygirl, a movie written and directed by Dutch filmmaker Halina Reijn and starring Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson, is about facades. It's also about sex, but less about sex itself and more about what sex says about a person, and the ways we suppress our sexual appetites in order for it to say nothing about us at all. Babygirl, Reijn's second English-language film after 2022's Bodies Bodies Bodies, taps into a conservative cultural moment that is firmly anti-sex while still being in sex's thrall. It is the subject everyone wants to talk about but no one wants to see, or seemingly even have.\nThe movie follows tech CEO Romy Mathis (Kidman), an unabashed, all-caps GIRLBOSS who nominally \"has it all\": a powerful job, a big office, an eager assistant who looks up to her, a seemingly well-adjusted family that includes two daughters and a hot theater director for a husband (Antonio Banderas). But there is a restless beast inside of Romy, and vanilla sex with her husband can't appease it—so much so that Romy often finds herself having to watch dom-play porn in the bathroom afterwards in order to actually reach an orgasm. When a much younger intern for the company arrives, Samuel (Dickinson), she slowly finds herself ensnared in his web, and discovers that he is up for taming that beast. Both in spite and because of the power dynamics and the threat their affair poses to her life and career, they begin an ill-advised relationship that is hot and steamy, but most importantly effective and passionate. Romy finds her sexual needs met for the first time, which, in this movie, is as important as the tension or thriller aspects at play.",

          "description": "In the narrow, highly specialized field of fish with blob-like attributes, one fish has dominated for decades: One would hardly dare imagine a blobbish fish without first thinking of the blobfish. But has a new blobby fish emerged to unseat this age-old champion of blobdom?\nToday, a group of researchers from the nonprofit Conservation International published a report of 27 new species discovered in Alto Mayo, a region in the Peruvian Amazon. Each of the species was a singular delight: the amphibious mouse that dwells in palm swamps called aguajales; the small, stubby chestnut-colored salamander that climbs trees. But as I scrolled through the report, one species was a clear standout—a born star, never readier to accept its place in the spotlight. This, of course, was the blob-headed fish.",

          "description": "In an industry-wide first, the National Labor Relations Board argued last week that contestants participating in Netflix’s hit reality TV dating show Love Is Blind should be classified as employees. If implemented into policy—which, admittedly, seems unlikely given the fact that Donald Trump is expected to fire the current NLRB general legal counsel—the filing could not only give more on-set protection to participants of shows like Love Is Blind but potentially allow them to unionize. \nSince its oddly prescient premiere in February 2020, which saw 15 men and 15 women dating, falling in love and eventually getting engaged sight unseen, Love Is Blind has faced allegations of mistreatment and coercion. Early contestants have accused producers of plying them with alcohol while regularly denying them food and water; one contestant alleged that production pushed her to continue filming even after she told them that she was experiencing suicidal ideation and wanted to leave. Over the past four years and seven seasons, the two production companies behind Love Is Blind—Kinetic Content and Delirium TV—have faced multiple lawsuits from former contestants. One of them alleges “inhumane working conditions” while another accuses Kinetic and Delirium of negligence, false imprisonment and sexual assault.",

This is why I have made it my business to reach as many members of the normal-person community with the Good News about the disgraced and deliriously scammy founder and figurehead of Ozy Media, who was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison for various oafish and common financial crimes earlier this week. I understand that my personal grievances with, say, Vice Media founder Shane Smith are my own, and my own problem; I understand, too, that there is no reason for really anyone to know who Jim Spanfeller is, although I have not always honored that. I get all this.\nBut it is my belief that Watson's baroquely thirsty and fraudulent public arc, while powered by the specific scamminess and scuzz of online media during the previous decade, is wild and weird enough to resonate even with people lucky enough to have avoided working in that field during that time. We put that to the test this week by having our buddy and former GMG executive editor Susie Banikarim on to talk about her new podcast about Watson's rise and fall.",

          "description": "It is a beloved media tradition: when a dysfunctional team's dysfunctional season reaches its dysfunctional end, reporters covering that team are permitted to write one big notebook-dumping explainer/eulogy. With a few outré exceptions, no one cares enough about bad teams to justify two such stories; with a few outré exceptions, no team is quite dysfunctional enough to fill out more than one. If you are a Tennessee Titans fan, to take one example, this is more or less the one big thing you have left to look forward to this season. You already know the team is lousy, inert, soggy and sodden and miserable; in a few weeks, once everyone goes home, you will find out whether that has anything to do with Tony Pollard's insistence upon letting his pet puma wander around the locker room or some such thing. That is how it usually works.\nBut the New York Jets are different. Everyone always and already knows about the pumas wandering around the locker room. Every week their ulcerous and increasingly haggard quarterback joins Pat McAfee's ESPN show via Zoom, seemingly from the Black Lodge, and starts Speaking Real Words about the germ theory of disease or whatever else is troubling him; this week, Aaron Rodgers testily demanded that critics of his (terrible!) recent play disclose their vaccination status, either as an indication of their bias or just as proof that they lack the courage that permitted Rodgers to self-immunize against infectious disease, possibly by eating hundreds of small, smooth rocks. This is just how the Jets are, and more or less how they have been since the pharmaceutical heir Woody Johnson bought the team 25 years ago. That they have the longest streak in American pro sports without a playoff appearance is not surprising given all that, but also feels somehow incidental to the organization's broader project, which under Johnson's blithely buttheaded stewardship has mostly been to generate news about people getting fired.",

          "description": "In the news that everything was thinking about, Mercedes announced Thursday morning that Valtteri Bottas would be returning to the team as its reserve driver. Bottas spent the past three years as an unfortunate, i.e. racing for Alfa Romeo–turned–Kick Sauber, but up until 2021, Bottas had represented everything a championship-winning team needed in a second driver: fast enough to ensure 1-2 finishes, good enough in qualifying to occasionally beat Lewis Hamilton, not quite good enough to disrupt a clear 1-2 hierarchy. The full circle continues what has been considered one of the kinder arcs for a second driver post-eviction: freed from the pressure of one-year contracts and matching up against literally Lewis Hamilton, Bottas grew a mullet and a mustache, posted ass, and then managed to return to Mercedes with zero expectations.\nIf Sergio Pérez has half that, he will be fortunate. Red Bull announced yesterday that Pérez would be leaving the team after three seasons. Pérez is already missing out on the clean end-of-term-into-multi-year-contract-with-another-team sequence that Bottas got. Lest anyone forgets, Pérez's contract was initially due to expire at the end of the 2024 season, but six months ago, Red Bull Racing announced that they had extended his contract by two years. This was a baffling decision at face value, but could be explained by the disaster of Red Bull leadership, McLaren evading consideration as legitimate Constructors' Championship contender, Daniel Ricciardo still being in the second VCARB seat, and Pérez having a far worse second half of the season compared to his first—he had four podiums prior to the extension, and zero after. In the end, Red Bull had to worm its way out of an easily avoidable extension, and took a no doubt expensive route to an inevitable result; Sergio Pérez lasted for longer than expected, but he, too, fell victim to the curse of the second Red Bull seat.",

          "description": "It was an eventful year for our award's namesake. Shams Charania's mentor-turned-rival Adrian Wojnarowski left ESPN in September to take a job in college basketball. Just three weeks later, Charania left The Athletic and assumed Woj's place as \"Senior NBA Insider.\" This was perhaps always his destiny, since he was a news-breaking teenage prodigy: to speak his beautiful sentences on linear TV, to appear in a little photo inset for news graphics. In November, Charania was granted an award for basketball writing besides ours: first place in the Professional Basketball Writers Association's 2024 Blumenthal Memorial Writing Contest, for his co-bylined work with The Athletic's Jon Krawczynski. If any of the other awardees are reading this post, please reach out: We're curious to know what it's like to learn that you have won an award for good writing, and then, within the same sentence, learn that Shams Charania has also won it.\nIt is momentous to present the Shamsy in this strange year of \"artificial intelligence.\" Sometimes critics compare the scoopster prose style to the output of a large language model; I find this funny, but off the mark. While often factually wrong and semantically hollow, an LLM's sentences typically scan like sentences that real humans might produce. Perhaps lazy or thoughtless humans trying to cheat on their homework, but real ones. These models are, after all, trained on a huge corpus of human writing. But the compositions of Shamsy award winners are compelling precisely because they deviate from default human rhythms. Man has not yet devised an intelligence that can report a Jarred Vanderbilt injury in such a disorienting fashion. For now, the human mind is more flavorfully stupid than its technological successors. That's what makes these nominees some of the most innovative writers working today, and that's why we're grateful to sift through these submissions.",

          "description": "The Charlotte Hornets scheduled a Christmas-themed on-court skit for a break in the second quarter of their home loss Monday to the depleted 76ers. The setup involved Hugo, the mascot of the Hornets, learning what a couple of participating children most want for Christmas, and then delivering the goods. The payoff, as far as I can tell, was supposed to come with the final wish: A kid tells Hugo, sadly, that his father is moving the family to Philadelphia, and Hugo saves the day by producing a new father, clad in a Hornets jersey, to keep the family in Charlotte. You're rolling your eyes now, but someone at the Hallmark Channel is rubbing their hands together greedily while their assistant speed-dials Luke Macfarlane.\nTo set up this joke, the skit had to first demonstrate that Hugo had Santa-like powers. The second and penultimate child to interact with Hugo, a 13-year-old named Jack, asked for and received a Playstation 5. In the same way that the children in the punchline did not get to keep the actor in the Hornets jersey, Jack was never intended to keep the Playstation 5; the expensive hardware was meant to establish Hugo's generosity, in order to set up the gag about how a Hornets-loving dad, to replace your regular, crappy one, would a great and wonderful gift. The Hornets were giving the gift of entertainment, to the audience, with a skit! They were not giving a PS5 to a child. Alexei Phillips, Jack's uncle, told Queen City News that after the skit the Hornets took back the PS5, and instead gave his nephew a Hornets jersey.",

Not Oscar season, but rather that stretch when the halls of streaming services are decked with the brightly lit, thinly disguised advertisements that are the year's new Christmas movies. There are more than 100 new Christmas films to watch this holiday season, and whether that number horrifies or excites you depends upon how much of a freak you are for the festive. Sabrina is proud to say they are a real Christmas freak, and this year they asked some of their colleagues to watch some of the most, uh, available new holiday movies. The fifth movie in our lineup is The Christmas Quest, a movie that pushes the boundary of what a neckline can be.\nSabrina Imbler: I’m so excited to talk with both of you about Hallmark’s first and potentially last foray into the special kind of love that stems from a mutual interest in Icelandic antiquities. Before we talk about the movie, I would love to learn more about your relationship with archaeology and the rich cultural traditions of Iceland. What interested you in watching this movie in particular? Had you heard of the Icelandic Yule Lads, or Jólasveinar, before?",

Marshall, which won its first title in the 2020 season as an unseeded team, was the 13th seed this year and reached the final by defeating the No. 1 Ohio State. Meanwhile, unseeded Vermont beat two-seed Pitt and three-seed Denver on its way to the title game. The Thundering Herd and Catamounts put together a real thriller Monday night, as Vermont won its first championship in program history on a sudden-death goal in overtime.\nThat goal is at the 7:56 mark of the highlight reel below, though the entire second half of the match was very dramatic. Marshall took a 1-0 lead in the 57th minute after Vermont keeper Niklas Herceg mishandled a tough cross right into the path of Tarik Pannholzer. Herceg kept his team in it with a beautiful save minutes later, and in the 81st minute, Marcell Papp took advantage of a poor clearance from Marshall keeper Aleksa Janjic to start and finish a one-two with a shot from just inside the box. You're here for the winner, though. In overtime, centerback Zach Barrett intercepted a pass in the Vermont half and smacked a speculative longball for Maximilian Kissel. The forward shrugged off his defender, then dribbled around Janjic and scored.",

Despite having, in her estimation, thousands of articles of clothing, Chamberlain says she was never satisfied. Instead, once she had accumulated what she decided were too many clothes, she would do a massive purge of her closet—only to fill it back up again. It's an interminable cycle: Buying a new thing is the answer to your emotional issue du jour, that is until you've unintentionally filled your home with too many things, at which point the only thing you can do to feel better is to purge. \nOnce Chamberlain had ruthlessly evaluated each of the pieces in her closet, what she was left with, to her surprise, was a sort of capsule wardrobe, a deliberately small, curated collection of clothing intended to be worn interchangeably. That Chamberlain, uber-influencer and proprietor of a 12 million–follower YouTube channel, has gone capsule is indicative of the sustaining appeal of the concept, and I believe indicates an attempt to exert aesthetic control in a time of marked economic and social instability.",

          "description": "So far, the person who killed United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson seems to have gotten what he wanted. It has been 13 days since Thompson was gunned down on a Manhattan street, and at this point the murder has been rather comfortably situated as an act of political violence. Authorities have charged a man named Luigi Mangione with the crime, and if a note he was carrying with him at the time of his arrest is to be believed, Thompson was killed as a response to the cruelty and depravity of the American healthcare industry, which has since become an urgent topic of conversation in American media and culture.\nEvidence of the killer’s victory can be found on any news channel, or in any number of mainstream publications. There was a brief period of time when one could get away with dismissing the enthusiasm that swelled around Mangione’s alleged act as something that only existed in the unreality of the internet—the byproduct of a small, irony-poisoned segment of the country that best understands how to use social media as a megaphone. If that enthusiasm ever was contained, it has since escaped: SNL is now a safe place to joke about Thompson’s death, and respectable publications like The New Yorker and New York Magazine have acknowledged Mangione’s folk-hero status. The effectiveness of the killing can also be found in reactions from those in the government. New York Governor Kathy Hochul has convened a “safety summit” for New York CEOs, and Florida authorities charged a mother with making terroristic threats for saying “delay, deny, depose” (the words Mangione allegedly wrote on his shell casings) during a phone call with her insurance provider. Senator Elizabeth Warren evidently takes the groundswell of support for Mangione seriously enough to pander to those who sympathize with him. She recently went on TV to say, “Violence is never the answer … but you can only push people so far.”",

It was never far gone, although consecutive home-and-away losses to the Atlanta Hawks confer a soupçon of illegitimacy so long as the Hawks remain the only team in the NBA to have lost twice to the abominable three-win Washington Wizards. The Cavaliers appear to have recovered from the wobble, and this is all normal basketball business in November and December, but it's enough to say that the team regressed after the best start in franchise history. That was inevitable. The questions had to do with how far their form would dip—are they as capable of excruciating lows as they are of rarified highs—and where precisely they'd sit in the league hierarchy once they'd settled.\nThat is possibly the most hedged and evasive basketblog lede ever written about a team with just four losses a third of the way through an NBA regular season. Part of that, I swear, is an effort to contain my own excitement about this Cavaliers team. I find them very easy to like, notwithstanding the few minutes every game that Donovan Mitchell spends waving his personal stamp around like a crazed mail clerk. Monday night they beat the absolute hell out of the Brooklyn Nets, recovering from a quick opening deficit with a vicious 16–0 run and then pouring it on, so that the final 39 minutes or so of a 48-minute contest were treated like an exhibition. Cleveland's scoring efficiency was downright unreasonable: The four starters not named Donovan Mitchell combined for 56 points and missed just five total shots and one free throw between them. Caris LeVert and Georges Niang drilled 8 of 14 three-point attempts off the bench. Without anyone even having a standout performance, the Cavs breezed to 130 points, and only Darius Garland kicking the ball around uncharacteristically and Sam Merrill forgetting how to shoot prevented them from sniffing 150.",

This makes a certain degree of sense, as Flagg is a huge destroyer who has been kicking ass for Duke and looking every bit like the sort of prospect who could push NBA defense forward, someone without precedent (in draftese, he's been \"demonstrating the myriad ways he affects winning.\") But you don't need to be a basketball alien to be cool. Dylan Harper is a hyperskilled operator, the man widely projected to be selected one pick after Flagg, and the most magnetic player in college basketball.\nWhere Flagg is a somewhat idiosyncratic player, causing open confusion among NBA execs, there's zero uncertainty about the sort of professional Harper will be. He is the consummate modern point guard, someone who looks like he is playing at a pro level already. I don't really understand how college defenders are supposed to guard someone who is 6-foot-6 with a plus-four wingspan and this advanced of a ball-handler with both hands. Harper is the ideal driver, gliding both past and through defenders, who always appear to be flailing like used-car inflatable dancing guys in contrast to Harper's perfect balance. He's also shooting 36 percent from three—not an eye-popping number, but his mechanics are clean, not to mention beautiful, and that figure includes a ton of self-created step-back stuff and his recent hot stretch of 46 percent over the past four games. Harper had his big moment this past weekend, when he nailed a buzzer-beating three to down Seton Hall in an extremely competitive game.",

Of course, this blog is not about Juan Soto.\nLast week, the Yankees signed free agent Max Fried to an eight-year, $218 million contract. This at least covered the record-breaking portion of rebuilding Soto's contract in the aggregate, though instead of the more straightforward \"biggest contract in MLB history,\" it came with the qualifiers of being the largest guarantee for a left-handed pitcher. Also like Soto's contract, the contract has a large risk of being player-friendly toward the end—Soto will be 41 when his runs out; Fried is currently 30 with a spotty injury history—but the Yankees front office, like the Mets', will only cry about the final years if the team doesn't make some deep runs in the first few.",

But wins are all that matters, and when the playoffs start the most important thing for the Chiefs will be that they have the best quarterback in football, who has found a way to win when it counts, even when it requires a little demon magic along the way. Everyone has been waiting for this football team to finally implode, but it hasn't happened yet, and they still have Patrick Mahomes.",

It was 13-7 Indianapolis, and the Colts picked off the Broncos' first possession of the second half, and on the second play from scrimmage, Jonathan Taylor broke free, seemingly scoring on a 41-yard-touchdown scamper.",

It has all the elements we think we deserve—points, absurd plays, points, easily caricatured main characters, points, long-to-the-point-of-seemingly-interminable-suffering fan bases, points, a coach who wants all his linemen to have touchdowns, more points, another coach who has been slagged repeatedly for not reaching let alone winning the big one, additional points, the MVP and the Coach Of The Year if you're into that sort of thing, further points, towns that fight the odds just by getting out of bed every day, another round of points, drunks jumping through furniture, and one final round of points.\nNow comes the hard part, which is coming to grips with the likelihood that we likely won't get Bills-Lions again, and having the fortitude and dignity to refuse to watch whatever matchup the National Football League tries to pretend we'd rather have instead. In other words, if it ain't Bills-Lions, we must cancel the parties, refuse to get dressed on game day, and hate-watch the Puppy Bowl instead. If we can't get it together to do the right thing in November, we may as well give it an honest go in February.",

          "description": "Thonsepar, aka St. Mary's Islands, aka Coconut Island, sits in the Arabian Sea just off the coast of Karnataka state of India. The island is known for its distinctive geological formations, specifically the columnar joints (hexagon-shaped interlocking columns) that protrude from the earth.\n\r\nThe columnar joints vary in height, but the tallest of them measures approximately six meters (20 feet). According to geologists, the columns formed by subvolcanic activity roughly 60 million years ago as Madagascar split off from India.\n\r\nThe shape of these joints is the product of a physical process that can happen as melted lava rock solidifies. As a large amount of molten material cools, it starts to contract, creating cracks in the newly solid surface. The cracks extend down as the rock below the surface continues to cool, resulting in these unique rock formations. You can see similar formations at the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland.\n\r\nThonsepar was classified as a National Geological Monument in 2001 by the Geological Survey of India.",

It is housed in a charming 18th-century building in the Sablon district and showcases the founder's private collection of diverse antiquities and erotic art through the ages.\n\r\nFor thousands of years, sexuality and eroticism have been recurring themes of art, whether humorous or arousing. The collection that Martens has amassed includes a vast array of genitalia, lovemaking, and bodily aesthetics in every medium and material. Once you enter, you will be surrounded by phallic shapes and yonic images, while statuettes perform Kama Sutra positions in ivory, bronze, and wood, as Greek gods and Aztec warriors and Japanese courtesans.\n\r\nThe museum also boasts an original bronze sculpture by Salvador Dalí and regularly holds temporary exhibits focused on different aspects of erotic art. If you have any ounce of interest in sexual ethnography, don't be shy and pay this gem a visit.",

There’s a special magic about that time of year—something enchanting about the stark contrast between the white snow and the dark slash of a steam-powered train, between the pale blue sky and the dark shapes of cows huddled contentedly amid the drifting snow. If you want a real taste of the Old West, there’s no better time to make your pilgrimage than winter.\n\r\nColorado’s cowboy culture is older than the state itself.

In 1962, he came up with the idea of building miniature versions of real cars. By 1965, he was able to build a working scaled-down 1928 Chevy two-door sedan made out of nine old refrigerators and powered by a two-cylinder, 13-horsepower Onan motor.\n\r\nSince then, Adams has built countless 11/16th scale model cars, all of them street-legal and complete with windshield wipers, air conditioning, and radios. In 1979, he ventured into race cars, participating in the first dwarf car race at the 1983 Yavapai County Fair. Before his recent retirement from building cars due to old age, he ventured into building classic touring cars.\n\r\nAdams and his family, who are originally from Harvard, Nebraska, now operate a museum on their Arizona property showcasing some of his work. He often hangs out at the museum. On site, one can view a short film and book explaining how he creates his vehicles. One can also see his workshop and other cars and related memorabilia he has collected.",

          "description": "Rafting through the Cañon del Güejar means traversing through 500 million-year-old rock formations amid the Sierra de la Macarena (Macarena Mountain Range), one of the world’s most biodiverse areas. It is part of the Guiana Shield, an ancient geological formation that spans parts of Colombia, Brazil, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and southern Venezuela. It is a ride through archaic landscapes, primeval forests, and the cascading waterfalls of the Rio Güejar (Güejar river).  \n\r\nThe region is relatively new to tourism. Until about 10 years ago, it was controlled by FARC guerillas and classified as a “red zone” conflict area, one of the most dangerous areas in the country. Now it’s attracting adventure tourists looking to experience the natural beauty of Colombia’s more remote topography. Since it is also a wildlife refuge surrounded by national parks, prepare for an abundance of animal sightings including bears, otters, and a variety of bird species. One of the notable landmarks is the El Cerro del Indio Acostado, an ancient rock formation that looks like a man’s profile and is beloved by locals. \n\r\nDuring the rafting experience, there are myriad opportunities to bathe in waterfalls and swim in the crystalline waters of the Rio Güejar in between navigating the gushing rapids. Don’t rush to leave the region after the rafting adventure because there’s a variety of nature activities to fully immerse yourself in, like tubing, horseback riding, and hiking; all of which support the local families who are building tourism options in their communities.",

          "description": "Through the city of Sendai runs the Hirose River. It has several stream pools along its course, one of which is known as Kashikobuchi, or the Wise Abyss, and there is a chilling legend that accounts for its name.\n\r\nOnce upon a time, a local man was fishing by this stream pool when he found a gossamer thread tied around his ankle. Finding it strange, the man undid it and instead tied it around the trunk of a nearby willow tree. The same thing happened over and over again, until the tree got dragged into the water with a loud noise. Dumbfounded, the man stood there watching the ripples spread on the surface of the river.\n\r\nOut of the silence that followed, an ominous voice was heard saying \"Kashikoi, kashikoi \"(Very wise, very wise). Then the man finally saw what lurked underneath the water: a monstrous spider that reigned over the area, preying on unsuspecting villagers.\n\r\nInterestingly, the same spider makes an appearance in another folk tale of Sendai. In this legend, a large eel that lived in the downstream called on another villager to aid him in a fight with the spider, asking him to stand by as a witness and not to make a sound. The next evening, the villager came to see the eel and the spider fighting, and could not help but scream in terror. This caused the eel to lose the battle, and all the villager saw was its severed head glaring at him from the water, before losing his mind and dying.\n\r\nThe Spider of Kashikobuchi was both feared and worshipped by the villagers, who regarded him as a god of trade and protector against floods. Today, a largely neglected stele in the thicket by National Route 48—overlooking the Kashikobuchi pool, no less—serves as the only testament to this spider god, here referred to as Myōhō-gumo-no-rei, or the Ghost of the Mystic Spider.",

That seems like an obvious goal, but in the modern market, durability and appearance have long trumped flavor in the produce aisles. So by growing delicious heirloom varieties, the Masumotos are making a radical choice. And with no guaranteed commercial buyers, they often have to rely on equally radical systems to sell their fruit. That’s why, 20 years ago, Mas decided to tread new ground to save the Elberta peach—an almost-extinct heirloom stone fruit—by creating his Adopt-a-Tree Program.\n\r\nWhen I first …",

Visitors can examine a comprehensive collection of musical instruments from various ethnic and cultural groups. The displays provide context about the historical significance, construction techniques, and cultural importance of these musical artifacts.\n\r\nTraditional Moroccan music is classified by its kaleidoscopic regional variations. Among the most common styles are Amazigh, Andalusi, malhun, chaabi, aita, reggada, gnawa, and guedra. Each of these styles is associated with specific ethnic groups and musical instruments. Made of locally available resources and at times with hard-to-come-by materials, these instruments required is astonishing level of artisanship.  \n\r\nArchitecturally, the museum preserves the splendor of a traditional Moroccan palace, with its beautiful inner courtyard and elaborately decorated rooms serving as an exceptional setting for the musical instrument exhibits. The space itself tells a story of cultural refinement, with each room carefully designed to complement the musical displays and provide visitors with an immersive experience of Morocco's musical heritage.\n\r\nAn inscription unearthed in the reception room attests that the building was constructed in 1882. The original owner of this palace was Ben Larbi Jamai, Grand Vizier of Sultan Moulay Hassan I. In 1912, the French authorities repurposed this building to serve as a military hospital, and a few years later, in 1920, the palace was officially recognized as a historical monument. The same year, the Museum of Indigenous Arts was opened on its premises.  Since then, the theme of the museum has undergone several transformations, and in 2014, it eventually became the National Museum of Music.",

At its center stands a 20-foot-tall (6-meter) figure, simply called Santa—a creation that has become both a curiosity and a controversy.\n\r\nThe striking red bronze sculpture, created by Los Angeles artist Paul McCarthy, has earned nicknames like the “Dildo Gnome” and “Santa with Butt Plug” because the object Santa holds—a Christmas tree—bears a suggestive resemblance to a sex toy. With exaggerated features and provocative humor, it’s impossible to miss.\n\r\nMcCarthy frames his work as a critique of Western consumerism and the holiday season’s excesses, blending high and low culture with playful irreverence. He notes that an innocent Christmas icon can carry distinctly adult undertones: while it might simply be a Christmas tree, it could also resemble a butt plug—redefining it as abstract art.\n\r\nPublic opinion in Oslo is divided: some see the statue as a tacky distraction, while others embrace its absurdity as a quirky addition to the cityscape. Even far-right organizations have voiced their disapproval, arguing that it undermines traditional values, sparking debates about artistic expression and cultural identity.\n\r\nChristian Ringnes, brewer heir and philanthropist, whose foundation funded the project, calls the statue a bold centerpiece for the area—an amusing, lively twist for an otherwise unremarkable spot. Ringnes admits he initially saw it as a jolly Santa Claus, only later recognizing its more provocative interpretations.\n\r\nOslo’s version, painted bright red and constructed from rough, horizontal slices, differs from the smooth, dark, unpainted original in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Planned for installation in 2001, the Dutch statue faced delays and was ultimately relocated a couple of times after intense backlash to its design.",

Originally a lantern festival, Nebuta has since developed into a parade involving huge papier-mâché floats that mainly portray kabuki actors, mythological figures, and folk heroes.\n\r\nFounded in 2011, the Nebuta Museum Wa Rasse exhibits such floats used in the most recent festival, celebrating this unique cultural event and archiving its history. The name was chosen as the winner of a public naming competition; rasse is based on rasse-ra, the typical heave-ho shout cried out by the float-haulers, while wa has several meanings in Japanese including \"harmony\" and \"circle.\" Together, the name is also meant to evoke the word warai, or \"laughter.\"\n\r\nLocated in the Aomori Waterfront area, the museum is only a short walk from the city’s central station. The building that houses the museum is an eye-catching sight, with red vertical louvers covering its exterior and giving its entrance a look like that of a steel curtain parting to welcome visitors.\n\r\nThe museum is a dark, spacious hall filled with colorful lights coming from the Nebuta floats, showcasing traditional artistry and folklore.

          "description": "Most of western Bulgaria is a moderate seismic risk zone, but it is also blessed with many hot springs. They vary in temperature and the healing mineral they naturally contain, and have been enjoyed ever since Roman times.\n\r\nIn Gorna Banya, the water has been revered for its healing nature for centuries. According to local folk tales, the waters had restored the once-abandoned village and healed a hunting dog from the valley of Sofia.\n\r\nIn 1922, a modern bathhouse with separate bathing areas and medical facilities was built, replacing an old Ottoman building. The ornate brick structure was designed in a late Vienna Secession style, with reinforced concrete domes and stone statues.\n\r\nPublic bathing culture started to decline in the 1960s as bathrooms became commonplace in new buildings, and collapsed further after the fall of the communist regime, as government subsidies for public baths dried out, leaving all but a few profitable structures closed and abandoned. The Gorna Banya bath house was no exception.\n\r\nToday, the beautiful abandoned structure is a shadow of its former self. Yet contrary to most of its abandoned counterparts, it rarely falls completely silent. The water that once gave it life now flows freely right next to it, in a public fountain that attracts those who still seek the town's mineral-rich waters.",

There was not a piece of furniture to be seen. The walls of all the empty rooms were covered in newspapers, and all the overhead lights had been replaced with black-light bulbs, filling the air with a purple haze. Someone had used the newspapers as a canvas, drawing giant mushrooms and other psychedelic shapes with white paint that glowed blue in the ultraviolet light. \n Someone in that house had paid attention in chemistry…",

Of the 119 works in the series, two depict the same location in today's Ueno Park: a horticultural oddity known as the Moon Pine Tree.\n\r\nFounded in 1631 and moved to the current location in 1694, the Kiyomizu-Kannondō pavilion of the former Kan'ei-ji Temple complex is modeled after Kiyomizu-dera Temple in Kyoto, with its own version of the famous platform called the \"stage.\" In front of it once stood the Moon Pine Tree, a landscaping wonder with a long branch that drew a perfect circle, from which visitors could have a scenic view of the Shinobazu Pond framed in a full moon.\n\r\nThe original Moon Pine Tree was knocked down in the early Meiji era during a typhoon and remained lost for nearly 150 years. In 2012, it was reconstructed with state-of-the-art horticultural techniques.

          "description": "Located near Kilmartin in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, Poltalloch House is a significant 19th-century mansion now in ruins. Constructed between 1849 and 1853, the house was designed by William Burn, a prominent architect known for his work in the Scottish Baronial style. Built for the Malcolm family, who were influential landowners in the area, the mansion features characteristic elements of the style, including turrets, battlements, and crow-stepped gables.\n\r\nThe house's decline began during World War II when it was requisitioned by the military. The wartime use led to significant wear and tear. After the war, the high costs of maintenance and changing economic circumstances contributed to the mansion's abandonment in the mid-20th century. Over time, Poltalloch House fell into disrepair, with its roof collapsing and interior largely destroyed.\n\r\nToday, Poltalloch House stands as a ruin. While no full restoration has been undertaken, there have been efforts to stabilize the structure to prevent further deterioration. Despite its dilapidated state, the house remains an important example of William Burn’s architectural work and the Scottish Baronial style that was popular in the Victorian era. It is fascinating to view the way in which nature has taken over the ruins with many trees and vines running over the crumbling structures. The mansion and the surrounding estate are historically significant to the region, reflecting the social and economic history of Scotland’s aristocracy.",

          "description": "Although far from the European front lines, the then-British colony of Sierra Leone was important to the war effort in both world wars. In World War I, the Royal West African Frontier Force served in operations against German forces in then-Togoland. In World War II, the strategic location of the port of Freetown meant it was fortified and became a critical base for protecting sea routes to the Middle East, India, and Australasia.\n\r\nThe vast majority of these forces were native Africans, many of them Sierra Leonean. Sierra Leoneans served as soldiers in the Frontier Force, and an even larger number served in the Carrier Corps. Combat in the African interior relied on vast quantities of materiel, but a lack of roads and mechanization meant that often the only effective method of transport was on the heads of the Carrier Corps.\n\r\nSierra Leonean forces saw combat from East Africa to Italy, and faced a grim death toll. Besides death in combat, many hundreds died of sicknesses including dysentery, tuberculosis, and especially malaria. The Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery honors soldiers who died during service in World War II. The cemetery contains the graves of 70 West African and four British soldiers.",

Designed to protect up to 150 workers, the structure, however, ultimately went unused, as Sweden remained largely untouched by the war.\n\r\nWhile relatively common in wartime Germany, this type of above-ground bunker is believed to be the only one of its kind in Sweden. Drawing on the pioneering work of engineer Leo Winkel, known for creating Winkeltürme (“Winkel Towers”) or Spitzbunker (“Pointed Bunkers”), the structure embodies both functionality and creativity. \n\r\nThe air raid shelter’s tall, narrow, circular base, with a metal-reinforced pointed top, was crafted to be nearly invisible to enemy bombers and exceptionally difficult to destroy. Even a direct hit would cause the payload to glance off the surface, rather than penetrating the walls.\n\r\nOvergrown with vines, the Spetsbunker remains a stoic sentinel. Though closed to the public, its weathered interior features a spiral staircase, platforms, and a central shaft with a winch. Its distinctive silhouette continues to serve as both a historical landmark and a reminder of wartime innovation.",

          "description": "Taco Bell's Crispy Chicken Nuggets feature white-meat chicken bites marinated in jalapeno buttermilk,\" breaded with a mix of breadcrumbs and tortilla chips, and then deep-fried.\n\nA 10-piece order included two dipping sauces and cost me $7.49. I went with the new Bell Sauce and Hidden Valley Fire Ranch.\nThere was quite a bit of variance in the size of the nuggets. The smallest piece was about half the size of the largest piece:\n\n\n\nThe breading was fairly thick with an almost knobby texture to it. I could see bits of tortilla chips sporadically embedded in it and some odd dark patches on the surface. It was lightly crispy but super crunchy when a piece of chip was encountered. The chicken inside was moist and decently tender. There was a lightly seasoned flavor to the nuggets and just a hint of spicy heat. Quality-wise, it's about the same level as frozen breaded chicken bites heated in the air fryer.\n\n\n\nThe new Bell Sauce offered a sweet tomato flavor and a distinct pepper note to go with a fair amount of spices, a mild heat, and a creamy, tangy mayo base.\nThe Hidden Valley Fire Ranch is a mixture of Hidden Valley Ranch and Fire Sauce. It was more run-of-the-mill versus the Bell Sauce. It offered the creamier buttermilk tang and herbiness of Hidden Valley ranch with an additional hit of tang and a moderate heat from Taco Bell's Fire Sauce.\n\n\n\nI found both sauces enjoyable but preferred the Bell Sauce as it was more complex and interesting.\nAt the end of the day, Taco Bell's Crispy Chicken Nuggets made for a decent but middling fast-food chicken nugget offering but with some added novelty from the new sauces.\nNutritional Info - Taco Bell Crispy Chicken Nuggets (10 pieces)\nCalories - 670\nFat - 33g (Saturated Fat - 3.5g)\nSodium - 1840mg\nCarbs - 20g (Sugar - 0g)\nProtein - 72g\nRead more at Brand Eating!",

          "description": "Zack Rosenblatt, Dianna Russini, and Michael Silver have written a devastating profile of the most dysfunctional franchise in all of U.S. pro sports, the New York Jets, whose dysfunction has a clear and obvious root cause: meddling idiot owner Woody Johnson (heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune). One example:\nA few weeks later, Douglas and his Broncos counterpart, George\nPaton, were deep in negotiations for a trade that would have sent\nJeudy to the Jets and given future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron\nRodgers another potential playmaker. The Broncos felt a deal was\nnear. Then, abruptly, it all fell apart. In Denver’s executive\noffices, they couldn’t believe the reason why.\nDouglas told the Broncos that Johnson didn’t want to make the\ntrade because the owner felt Jeudy’s player rating in “Madden\nNFL,” the popular video game, wasn’t high enough, according to\nmultiple league sources. The Broncos ultimately traded the\nreceiver to the Cleveland Browns. Last Sunday, Jeudy crossed the\n1,000-yard receiving mark for the first time in his career.\nComing into this season, the Jets had hopes of ending the\nfranchise’s 13-year playoff drought — the longest in the four\nmajor men’s North American sports — and quieting years of talk\nabout the franchise’s dysfunction. Instead, this season has only\ncemented the Jets’ reputation.\nThe fans of every other team in the NFL that is having a disappointing season — like yours truly — are all texting this story to each other today, with the same message: “At least we’re not the Jets.”\n ★",

The sixth episode of Season 2 is due out\non Dec. 20. The season finale is scheduled to debut on Jan. 17.\nI feel bad complaining about a good show not only getting renewed, but renewed through to a planned conclusion. I fucking hate when good shows get cancelled after one season.\nBut. While I really liked season 1 of Silo, season 2 has been a bore. We’re halfway through — five episodes — and everything interesting could have been put in one episode. Maybe one and half. I hope the remaining five episodes of season 2 pick up, but so far, it really feels like this entire season has just padding to get to what’s next. Hugely disappointing, really.\n ★",

          "description": "One last item on Acorn 8. Whether you are a longtime Acorn user (like me), or a would-be new user, you should set aside some time to actual read Acorn’s documentation. It’s a full user manual, and it not only describes, in detail, what every feature in the app does and how to use them, but also a vast array of “how-to” tutorials, many of them videos.\nIn broad strokes, there are two approaches to documenting a serious, professional-level app or software system. One was is a comprehensive functional reference resource. That’s a way that you, the user, can teach yourself how to use a feature, refresh your memory about a feature you haven’t used in a while, or even just check to see if a certain feature even exists. The other is a narrative, storytelling, tutorial approach. That’s not teaching yourself — that’s letting an expert teach you, and today that’s often a visual approach through video.\nAcorn’s document is so thorough that it encompasses both approaches. Either one would qualify Acorn as a well-documented application. But by including both, Gus Mueller should be given some sort of medal or award. Different people learn in different ways, and Acorn’s documentation is there for everyone.\nIt should go without saying, but no serious tool — hardware or software — is complete without thorough, polished documentation. Acorn goes above and beyond. It’s amazing enough that a company as small as Flying Meat — it’s really just Gus and his wife Kirstin — has produced a full-fledged professional-strength image editing application that has remained modern and cutting-edge for 17 years and counting. But it’s also accompanied by first-class comprehensive documentation.\n ★",

          "description": "Dan Moren, writing at Six Colors:\nThe newly released Acorn 8 adds a bunch of great\nfeatures to the mix. A few of them will be familiar to Apple\nplatform users: subject selection uses machine learning to let\nyou quickly isolate and grab the subject of a picture (there’s\nalso a corresponding “Remove Background” feature to simplify\nthat task) and a Live Text tool allows you to select and copy\ntext within an image.\nFor me, the star of the show is the fascinating Data Merge, which\nis a bit like Mail Merge for images. If you’ve ever needed to\ncreate the same image several times but with different information — nametags, for example, or personalized gift cards — this is a\nlife-saver. You open your template image, identify your variables,\nthen hand Acorn a CSV file with the relevant data and it will\nprocess through them, assigning text where needed and even putting\nimages in assigned layers. It’s the kind of wild automation tool\nthat might not be something you need every day, but when you do\nneed it, there’s really no replacement.\nThe rare sweet spot that Acorn hits is that it’s super-approachable to new and casual users, who just need an image editor sometimes, and super-powerful for power users who want to dig in.\n ★",

          "description": "Dave Nanian, writing on the Shirt Pocket blog:\nmacOS 15.2 was released a few days ago, with a surprise. A\nterrible, awful surprise. Apple broke the replicator. Towards\nthe end of replicating the Data volume, seemingly when it’s\nabout to copy either Preboot or Recovery, it fails with a\nResource Busy error.\nIn the past, Resource Busy could be worked around by ensuring\nthe system was kept awake. But this new bug means, on most\nsystems, there’s no fix. It just fails.\nSince Apple took away the ability for 3rd parties (eg, us) to copy\nthe OS, and took on the responsibility themselves, it’s been up to\nthem to ensure this functionality continues to work. And in that,\nthey’ve failed in macOS 15.2. Because this is their code, and\nwe’re forced to rely on it to copy the OS, OS copying will not\nwork until they fix it. [...]\nFor those who may be working for Apple, or have good contacts, the\nbug is FB16090831. A fix would be really helpful, folks.\nThis means Shirt Pocket’s outstanding utility SuperDuper can’t make a bootable clone of your startup drive on a machine running MacOS 15.2.0. It’s worth noting that you can still use SuperDuper (or other backup utilities) to clone all of your data, which is, by far, the most essential data in any backup. But bootable startup drives clones are an essential part of many people’s data integrity workflows.\nThis bug seems to affect CarbonCopyCloner and Apple’s own Time Machine, too. A bug like this is always unfortunate, but especially around the holidays, when it might take longer than usual to get fixed, even if the issue is escalated within Apple.\n ★",

          "description": "Gus Mueller:\nThis is a major update of Acorn, and is currently on a\ntime-limited sale for $19.99. It’s still a one time\npurchase to use as long as you’d like, and as usual, the full\nrelease notes are available. I want to highlight some of my\nfavorite things below.\n“Select Subject”, “Mask Subject”, and “Remove Background” are new\ncommands which use machine learning (or A.I. if you prefer) to\nfind the most important parts of your image, and then perform\ntheir respective operations. This has been a request for a long\ntime, and while I was doubtful of it’s utility, it’s actually\npretty fun to play with and more useful than I figured it would\nbe. So I’m glad I took the time to integrate it.\nYou can now set your measurement units to inches, centimeter, or\npixels, and it shows up across the tools for your image, not just\nspecific ones. This includes the crop palette, shape dimensions,\nfilter settings… well, pretty much everything. This might be the\noldest feature request I’ve implemented so far. And then related\nto this, Acorn 8 now has an on canvas ruler which you can use to\nmeasure out distances, straighten your image with, or even\nredefine the DPI.\nLook up Table (LUT) support. LUTs are pretty fun, and they work by\nmapping one set of colors to another, enabling consistent or\nstylized visual effects. LUTs are used primarily in photography or\nfilmmaking, and you can download and install new LUTs from various\nplaces across the internet.\nAnd more, so much more. The release notes are copious, and for me, always interesting. Acorn remains one of my most-used tools. It’s fast, reliable, powerful, extensible/scriptable, and the interface makes so much intuitive sense. That’s all been true since version 1.0 back in 2007, and that’s why it’s been my go-to image editor since it was in early beta before version 1.0 back in 2007. It’s just faster and more powerful today.\nAcorn is, simply put, one of the best Mac apps ever made. It’s that good. You’re nuts (sorry) if you don’t check it out while it’s available for just $20.\n ★",

DaVinci Resolve Studio will be updated to support\nediting Apple Immersive Video early next year, offering\nprofessional filmmakers a comprehensive workflow for producing\nApple Immersive Video for Apple Vision Pro. Apple Immersive Video\nis a remarkable 180-degree media format that leverages\nultra-high-resolution immersive video and Spatial Audio to place\nviewers in the center of the action. [...]\nBlackmagic URSA Cine Immersive features a fixed, custom lens\nsystem pre-installed on the body, which is designed specifically\nto capture Apple Immersive Video for Apple Vision Pro. The sensor\ndelivers 8160 × 7200 resolution per eye with pixel level\nsynchronization and an incredible 16 stops of dynamic range, so\ncinematographers can shoot 90fps 3D immersive cinema content to a\nsingle file. The custom lens system is designed for URSA Cine’s\nlarge format image sensor with extremely accurate positional data\nthat’s read and stored at time of manufacturing. This immersive\nlens projection data — which is calibrated and stored on device — then travels through post production in the Blackmagic RAW\nfile itself.\n$30,000 — not cheap, but not crazy.

          "description": "A few weeks ago, in a post primarily complaining about Google’s disingenuous claims about their Messages app’s support for encryption (they suggest, heavily, that it encrypts every message or most messages, but fact only supports encryption for RCS message sent between users of Google Messages on Android devices), I also complained about the fact that Google’s own Google Voice doesn’t support RCS at all.\nTurns out Google Fi doesn’t support RCS fully either. Google Fi is Google’s cellular phone service. I actually use it to provide service to my Android burner phone. The prices are excellent and the service is fine for my minimal needs for a phone I barely use. But Google Fi offers something called “call and voicemail sync” that lets Fi users make and answer voice calls through the web. If you enable this, you lose RCS. See Reddit threads here and here with Fi fans complaining about it.\nIt’s just wild to me that Google would spend years waging a campaign urging Apple to support RCS, yet Google itself doesn’t support RCS in its own products.\n ★",

These presliced sugar cookies have been the nostalgic flavor of December for as long as I can remember, and the printed designs only add to the whimsy.\nIt got me thinking: How hard could it be to replicate these fanciful cookies from scratch?

Now, the mighty olive takes candle form for the 14th day of the Eater Advent Calendar.\n \n\n\nI love big, non-candle-shaped candles as much as the next person — but, as a dirty martini-lover, I especially love it when they’re shaped like fist-sized olives. Nata Concept Store has taken our cultural obsession with aperitivo snacks of late (is tinned fish and cheese still “girl dinner”?) to new heights with its very White Elephant-worthy food-shaped candles, and this giant cocktail olive has my vote for so many reasons. Not only would it look delightful surrounded by a moat of artichoke dip, but the modest 2-inch height makes it ideal for dinner parties, as it won’t obstruct the views of your guests. I also appreciate that its rounded shape will help it burn without falling and spilling all over the place like some other non-candle-shaped candles I have purchased (to those wondering, butt-shaped candles are best left un-burnt). Most importantly, of course, it pays homage to one of my favorite savory snacks. \n\n\n\nNo peeking! But check out what the Eater Advent Calendar has already revealed.

Waves of restaurateurs from the continental U.S. and abroad have opened restaurants in Honolulu, with everyone from Japanese conglomerates to Michael Mina setting up shop. But simultaneously, Honolulu’s homegrown businesses have been able to ride waves of excitement to expand themselves. In the last decade, tiny mom-and-pop restaurants have opened second locations, while established local chains expanded their reach. More and more chefs have worked to learn about Hawai‘i’s history and culture to respectfully incorporate aspects into their restaurants. That is to say, diners in Honolulu are a bit spoiled for choice.\nUpdated, December 2024:\nThe winter tourist season has descended on Honolulu, and with holiday festivities in full swing, comfort foods and neighborhood stalwarts like the homey spot Moké’s Bread and Breakfast are the draw. Despite the generally warm weather, Honolulu is a soup town, and the slight dip in temperatures this time of year has people turning to only-in-Hawai‘i noodles at Palace Saimin, around since the mid-century, and clear, restorative bowls at Phở Tô Châu, an anchor in Honolulu’s Chinatown.\nEater updates this list quarterly to make sure it reflects the ever-changing Honolulu dining scene.\nMartha Cheng is a Honolulu-based writer for a number of local and national publications, and is the author of The Poke Cookbook.",

These are the food trends that Eater staff were most grateful for in 2024, from small aesthetic pleasures to larger nostalgic comforts. \nCookbook clubs\nI’ve been a part of a cookbook club since the middle of last year, but this year, they really blew up, with my friend Steph Lau’s cookbook club repeatedly going viral and even earning an appearance on Good Morning America.

The day we got the wedding license, we met another friend for dinner and he let us know that he had officiated a friend’s wedding, so we asked if he’d oversee ours.

We ate it during holidays, but never really enjoyed it, and certainly it never occurred to me to eat matzo on purpose beyond the 10 days or so a year when it was mandated. But is it any surprise that matzo became yassified? The latest company to tackle the unleavened market is Matzo Project, a cute, bubbe-themed brand that makes matzo good enough for even goyim to snack on: Matzo Project. It makes the usual “flats” and also meal for ball making, but may I suggest unwrapping a bag of matzo chips?  Small, wafer-like crackers that come speckled with everything seasoning, cinnamon sugar, or just salt. They’re tasty and flavorful, but their key characteristic might be their hardiness, which makes them ideal for any thick dip.\n\n\n\nNo peeking!

These are the essential, constituent elements of most items on the Taco Bell menu, guaranteeing that if you like the Beefy 5-layer Burrito you’ll probably also like the Mexican Pizza.\nThe chain’s newest addition, however, is decidedly not gloop.

          "description": "Chef Hiroki Odo uses a wagyu blend, sansho peppercorns, sake, and tamari to create this decadent burger.\n “I thought it would be nice to make a hamburger that mixed New York and Japan,” says chef Hiroki Odo. Actually, he made six. At Hall, Odo’s “conceptual bar” in the Flatiron District, the limited menu features a selection of wagyu burgers, from a simple single cheeseburger to one topped with A5 wagyu steak. \nStep by step, general manager Brian Saito walks through crafting Hall’s burgers. He starts with a blend of Sakura Wagyu chuck and A5 wagyu, finely grinding them and controlling just how much fat is in each patty. Then there’s the sauce, a combination of sansho peppercorns, “a perfect complement for the fattiness of the wagyu,” reduced in sake and tamari. It’s a sauce, Saito says, they also use at chef Odo’s titular kaiseki restaurant next door. All of it gets piled on buns made from the chef’s own recipe, “so their key point is a sense of unity.”\nThe entire Hall menu is in service of wanting to bring a variety of experiences to New York diners, says chef Odo, and to showcase all the cuisines Japan has to offer. But, he admits, multiple concepts in one space “isn’t the kind of restaurant you could open in Japan.” A cocktail and burger bar, in front of a chef’s counter, next to a kaiseki restaurant? That’s New York. \nWatch the latest episode of Icons to see how Odo and Saito create one of New York’s best burgers.",

It toes the line between being fancy and flavorful without having an appalling price tag. Its deep green hue is an indicator of the high-quality matcha each tin provides, but if that doesn’t convince you, the aroma — and flavor — will. This matcha is rich, floral, and subtly sweet but rounded out by mild bitterness. It’s delicious drunk straight because the matcha is already so smooth, but I also find it adds the perfect earthy bite to matcha lattes. I love to pair it with warm milk and a drizzle of vanilla bean paste for a fragrant matcha latte that is arguably better than any of the pale, $8 versions you might order at a coffee shop. One warning: Once you try this matcha, you can never go back to the cheaper stuff (nor will you want to, anyway).\n\n\n\nNo peeking!

          "description": "I’m a founder of simplyblock.io, where we’re building K8s-native storage backend for NVMe. Our tech is mostly aimed to support stateful workloads on Kubernetes. We’re seeing that scalable persistent storage is one of the reasons why people are scared to run state on Kubernetes.\nAnyhow, we talked to people and asked them about the number and sizes of their EBS volumes in EKS, and very few could answer. When asking about their actual usage, in terms of capacity throughput and IOPS, people usually don’t know where to find them. From the ones that checked it, the utilization rate is normally at 20-30%, which is crazy low. That’s mostly because lots of storage is overprovisioned on the database level.\nThat’s why we built a small tool to collect the data right in Kubernetes itself. The tool can be deployed into your EKS cluster via a helm chart. It only needs read access permissions. It exports all found EBS volumes to a CSV with their respective usage and performance information.\nWe also built a small calculator to provide a fast way to get insight from the CSV. The calculator is a pure in-browser tool and does not upload information to our servers. While we mostly built it for our prospects and customers, we believe it’s a valuable tool for the broader Kubernetes community, and we already think about how to expand the enabled environments and clouds.\nHope you enjoy it and find it useful! Feedback is appreciated.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42473290\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

It took a 6-hour+ non-strop spree to write a 81 pages, and it's kind of an instructive read!\nRather than making any line edits, I was able to share high level feedback over the first few chapters and keep regenerating. This process was awesome - I could be extremely ruthlessly critical for hours on end and it didn't hurt Claude's feelings, they just improved, until it was effectively \"trained\". We're all used to that with objective contexs like coding, but in a subjective context it was a different and really good feeling, like working with an incredibly mature friend in your band.\nBecause philosophical texts are short, you can write adaptations that maintain your feedback to the end, making it easier and easier to generate later chapters with no intervention.\nOne of the better collaborative experiences I've had! Once we have agents ready, should kind of just adapt all classic philosophical texts to allegories about DHH, AMD, and uh, Quibi.\nEnjoy!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42473286\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

Inspired by a few other projects, I built a basic HTML + Javascript dashboard, that does the same, simulating an old school LED display.\nEnjoy the Github repo!\nHow it works:\nStandard HTML page that loads the flightradar data in a specific location box that you specify. Because the free flightradar24 data is browser only, I used a corsproxy to get around loading issues. Everything works with the free versions, but if you hit limits, you can also specify a key to a paid CORS Proxy service.\nOnce the data is loaded, JS refreshes it every 30 seconds. The HTML itself is refreshed once an hour, so even a dashboard you don't have access to would be updated from new changes.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42473188\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

However, this means:\n1. Managing two different DI systems in your codebase\n2. Learning another framework's patterns\n3. Potentially duplicating dependency logic\nCurrently, there's no package that extends FastAPI's native Depends() beyond routes.\nfastapi-injectable solves this by providing a clean API that lets you use FastAPI's dependency injection anywhere.\nLinks:\nGitHub: https://github.com/your-username/fastapi-injectable\nDocs: https://fastapi-injectable.readthedocs.io\nPyPI: https://pypi.org/project/fastapi-injectable\nI'd love to hear your feedback and contributions to make this package better!

          "description": "Hi HN,\nI’m a solo founder, and I’ve been working on an AI tool that helps companies and organizations navigate and comply with EU regulations. The platform leverages AI to provide insights, research capabilities, and compliance assistance, aiming to reduce the complexity and time spent dealing with regulatory requirements.\nCompliance with EU regulations (like GDPR, labor laws, and industry-specific rules) can be overwhelming, especially for SMEs and startups. As someone passionate about tech and legal simplification, I saw an opportunity to create a tool that streamlines this process, providing actionable guidance while cutting down costs.\nWhat the tool does:\n- Uses AI to answer EU regulatory questions.\n- Provides links to legislation articles, so that users can dig deeper when needed.\n- The tool condenses complex legislation into clear summaries, drastically reducing the time needed to understand key topics.\nAs the only person behind this project, I wear multiple hats—coding, marketing, business development, and more. I’ve learned a lot, but I know there’s so much more to improve, particularly in product-market fit, user onboarding, and getting the word out.\nI'd love to hear from the HN community on a few topics in particular:\n- Product feedback: Does this solve a real problem for you or someone you know?\n- Marketing advice: What are the best ways to promote a niche AI tool like this?\n- Solo founder tips: For those who’ve been here, what’s your advice on staying productive and scaling effectively?\nI’d love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or even criticisms. Also, if you’ve had experience dealing with EU regulations, does this tool sound useful? What features would you want to see?\nHere’s the link to the tool: https://eur-lex.ai/\nThank you, and I’m looking forward to hearing your feedback!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42472053\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hi HN!\nI’m excited to share flybnb.io, a side project I built out of personal frustration while traveling full-time with my wife. We often searched for flights and Airbnb stays separately, only to realize that one was way out of budget after planning the other. I wanted a way to combine both searches and instantly see the total trip cost, so I built it myself.\nWhat flybnb.io can do:\n- Gets flights from SkyScanner and Airbnb prices in one go with total costs for each condition (ex: fast flight + cheap stay)\n- Smart Filters: Set minimum review counts and scores for stays to filter out unreliable listings that skew pricing.\n- Auto-categorize Airbnb listings into three price tiers (Economy, Standard, and Premium) for easy research/planning.\n- Generates links to directly search/book exact itinerary or listing on SkyScanner and Airbnb. (Note that sometimes SkyScanner results might differ in price from what is shown, working on a fix to have more accurate prices).\nUsing this tool ourselves we were able to actual visit new destinations that had a pricier flight, but was much cheaper overall due to great value and low cost Airbnbs. In the past we would search cheap flights first, then find accommodation resulting in a pretty high total cost. But for long stays and vacations, accommodation quickly becomes the largest cost.\nFor tech stack, I'm still new/beginner so using React with Material-UI, Supabase, and API's for the results.\nI’d love feedback from the community—especially on features you’d find helpful or ideas to improve discovery. This is a bootstrapped solo build, so I’m learning a lot as I go. Ask me anything!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42471064\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

Planning to add more features like spam protection, user login to post, moderation, dashboard, analytics etc. if there's interest.\nI hope you find GlintFlow as engaging and useful as I do and would love to get feedback on it!\nYou can check it out at https://glintflow.com, just scroll down to find a demo instance of it.\n## Motivation ##\nFirstly, I wanted to try out shadcn on a simple-enough project. I've mainly been using Mantine.js which have been great, and looks great, but honestly Shadcn looks even more amazing; both have very functional components. But looks aside, I wanted to see how much ease of development I'd be trading off for it - quite a bit, but not enough to drop shadcn.\nSecondly, I personally the claps to be more fun/engaging than the plain like/dislike buttons but haven't really seen any third-party embeddable commenting system. So built something to see if anyone would find it useful.\nIf you're interested in trying embedding an instance for yourself, ping me and I'll set something up for you. Not planning to charge anything atm and will try to keep it so permanently for early adopters as long as their usage is not ridiculous.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42470826\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

Easy peasy.\nBut since Google dropped into the e-signature space - we needed to talk.\nSo after 30 minutes of existential dread, a lot of “what are we even doing?” thoughts, and one strong dose of paracetamol\nwe said, screw it. - let’s change gears.\nSo now we're opening our beta, and here's the deal:\n• All the people who join will get free credits worth 10 signed docs\n• 12 months credit validity\n• No complexity\n• No hidden cost\n• No subscription commitment\nYou can join the beta here - http://signwith.co\nThat said, we see Google's entry in the signature space as validation.\nThis event expanded the market with such massive awareness.\nLet me be clear: We’re not trying to be DocuSign, Google, or any other enterprise beast.\nWe’re indie makers and building for:\n• The freelancers\n• The consultants\n• The indie and small business owners\n• and anyone who just needs a contract signed—fast, simple, no headaches.\nHere’s how SignWith works:\n• Upload your doc\n• Drop signature spots\n• Send it out and track\n• Pay per signed document\nThat’s it. No subscriptions. No feature bloat. No crazy hidden charges and no complex pricing tiers.\nIf you've read it so far, would love to see you on the other side.\nAnd hey, if you’ve got any feedback, suggestions, or just want to tell us what you need, reply here or drop me a DM.

The process of thinking about app design and interaction made me feel that launching an app is quite interesting.\nThe app went live a few weeks ago, and for the first three days after the launch, I adopted a limited free strategy. On the first day, over 5,000 people claimed a lifetime license for free, and then I continuously received feedback from people who wanted to suggest improvements for the app. This process made me feel more connected with others.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42468609\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

I'd like share about my sideproject https://gribstream.com\nIt is an API to extract weather forecasting data from the National Blend of Models (NBM) https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/mdl/nbm and the Global Forecast System (GFS) https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/gl... . The data is freely available from AWS S3 in grib2 format which can be great but also really hard (and resource intensive) to work with, especially if you want to extract timeseries over long periods of time based on a few coordinates. Being able to query and extract only what you want out of terabytes of data in just an http request is really nice.\nWhat is cool about this dataset is that it has hourly data with full forecast history so you can use the dataset to train and forecast other parameters and have proper backtesting because you can see the weather \"as of\" points in time in the past. It has a free tier so you can play with it. There is a long list of upcoming features I intend to implement and I would very much appreciate both feedback on what is currently available and on what features you would be most interested in seeing. Like... I'm not sure if it would be better to support a few other datasets or focus on supporting aggregations.\nFeatures include:\n- A free tier to help you get started\n- Full history of weather forecasts\n- Extract timeseries for thousands of coordinates, for months at a time, at hourly resolution in a single http request taking only seconds.\n- Supports as-of/time-travel, indispensable for proper backtesting of derivative models\n- Automatic gap filling of any missing data with the next best (most recent) forecast.\nPlease try it out and let me know what you think :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42467449\nPoints: 6\n# Comments: 2",

Instead of relying on metadata or broad categories like “comedy” or “society & culture” for search and recommendation, it segments episodes into bite-sized clips (30 seconds to 5 minutes), categorizes them using fine-tuned BERTopic, generates titles for each clip with a fine-tuned Mistral 7B (v0.2) model, and then runs semantic search on top of clip titles. This enables precise, content-focused search and personalized recommendations.\nFeatures include:\n- Granular Search: Semantic search matches queries to specific clips, not just episodes.\n- Tailored Recommendations: Based on individual listening patterns.\n- Ease of Sharing: Share specific podcast moments with ease.\nFuture plans include speaker recognition, multilingual tools, and generating news articles from transcripts.

It's a gem you install that works like Sentry or Rollbar, but aggregates deprecation warnings instead of exceptions. Docs are at https://docs.infield.ai/docs/monitor-deprecation-warnings\nWe built this because we rely on deprecation warnings at Infield as one piece of safely upgrading large Rails apps. Often large apps don't have perfect test coverage of all their gem usage, or use different codepaths in staging/prod than you on CI. There are good existing open source tools like https://github.com/Shopify/deprecation_toolkit for tracking deprecations in your CI suite but they don't work well in prod.\nOur tool works as an open source gem that you install (https://github.com/infieldai/infield-ruby) which spins up a background thread that collects deprecation warnings and reports them to our API. We aggregate them there and track them over time so you can verify you've addressed them before you push an upgrade. It works for any deprecation that goes through ActiveSupport::Deprecation, which covers Rails and a bunch of Ruby gems but not ruby itself (that'll come!).\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42465705\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 0",

Thumbly can bring that same functionality to your website.\nWith Thumbly, you can generate dynamic social media thumbnails for every page of your site. These thumbnails can automatically change based on the parameters you set, so each page has its own unique design. No need to manually create or upload different thumbnails every time you publish new content.\nI originally built Thumbly for one of my own side projects because I wanted dynamic, GitHub-style thumbnails for social media shares. I’d love to share it with others who might find it useful. So this is basically a side-project of a side-project.\nThere’s no signup page yet, but feel free to reach out to me via email. I’ll be happy to help you integrate Thumbly into your website or even set it up on your own server.\nI’m actively using Thumbly myself, so I’ll continue to improve and add features. Your feedback and ideas would mean a lot as I refine it!\nAnd if you are not happy with the pricing, I'd be happy to discuss something that fit your requirements and site's workload.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42463858\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

For over two years, we have been working on CxReports, a low-code tool for creating user-facing PDF documents and reports.\nWe first saw the problem in wealth management, where reports are crucial for the user experience. Software vendors have customers who ask for customized reports with unique content, branding, and visuals. The solution was to build a tool that allows customization for each customer, which even customers themselves can use. Over time, this evolved to be a generic solution that works for various other use cases.\nCxReports lets you build reports visually. You can connect to a database and get data using SQL queries. It supports scheduled report generation and delivery.

          "description": "Hello HN,\nI've recently been trying out and using the latest and greatest software development agents, including Windsurf and Cursor.\nBefore using those, I had been using aider for everyday practical SWE tasks, but aider is not very agentic --it's best at one-off, scoped programming tasks.\nI did a quick test by putting aider in a ReAct loop using create_react_agent from langchain. To my surprise, it ended up working very well --it's able to solve programming tasks that Windsurf has failed at.\nThe agent has access to many tools such as ripgrep, fuzzy find, filesystem navigation, etc. One tool, in particular, is an expert tool where it can use a dedicated reasoning model, such as OpenAI's o1, to reason about logic, bugs, or complex planning tasks. It's been really interesting to see when and how it decides to use these tools.\nThe project does support plugging in any model you want to use, but so far I've found it to work best with the latest claude as the agent, and o1-preview (or o1 if you have access to it) for the expert reasoning model.\nThis is something I put together out of practical need, so if you have ideas, feedback, or especially PRs, those are welcome.\nThe project is licensed as Apache 2.0 (same as aider) and is intended to be a public good --our open tool so we aren't all dependent on proprietary tools and services to get our work done. The dream is that it will eventually work well on fully open/local models.\nCheers\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42461738\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hey HN!\nAfter 6 years of R&D, our small team is excited to share our project TideCloak - an IAM designed to help developers move fast without worrying about catastrophic breaches or overpowered admins with keys to the kingdom.\nTraditional IAMs rely on centralized authority - admins, root certificates, and decryption keys - which create glaring vulnerabilities in a breach. To address this, we’ve integrated Keycloak (Red Hat’s IAM) with a decentralized key architecture powered by our (academically validated) Ineffable Cryptography.\nHere’s the idea: keys are split across a decentralized network (our Cybersecurity Fabric) so no one ever holds the full key. Even in a breach or F$%k up, there’s no unchecked authority exposed.\nRight now, TideCloak uses the Cybersecurity Fabric as an IdP, meaning users authenticate without their credentials being stored or shared. Essentially, users bring their own authority - without needing to trust anyone else to keep it safe.\nComing soon:\n- Identity Governance Administration to prevent super admin abuse.\n- User-sovereign digital assets, where assets are secured with unique decentralized keys to protect against mass breaches.\nWe’ve just launched a free developer sandbox, and we’d love your feedback:\nhttps://github.com/tide-foundation/tidecloak-gettingstarted\nIt’s still early stages, and your input will help us improve.\nThanks for taking a look - ask us anything!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42460131\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "RAGLite is a Python package for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.\nRAG applications can be magical when they work well, but anyone who has built one knows how much the output quality depends on the quality of retrieval and augmentation.\nWith RAGLite, we set out to unhobble RAG by mapping out all of its subproblems and implementing the best solutions to those subproblems. For example, RAGLite solves the chunking problem by partitioning documents in provably optimal level 4 semantic chunks. Another unique contribution is its optimal closed-form linear query adapter based on the solution to an orthogonal Procrustes problem. Check out the README for more features.\nWe'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions, and are happy to answer any questions!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42459464\nPoints: 12\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I’ve been working on a travel app called Voyalog. The idea came from my own struggles keeping track of trip details—flights, itineraries, places I wanted to visit, and even the random thoughts I had along the way. Nothing out there felt personal enough or flexible enough, so I decided to build it myself.\nWhat makes Voyalog different is how laid-back and flexible it is. It doesn’t try to control every aspect of your trip. You can use it to plan as much or as little as you want. It’s also a super clean way to keep your photos and attachments organized, with free cloud storage included.\nAs a digital nomad and solo developer, I’ve put my heart into this. I’d love to hear your thoughts—whether you find it helpful, see areas for improvement, or even if it’s something you’d actually use. I have plenty of ideas to expand and improve the app, but first, I want to make sure it truly resonates and makes sense for others.\nFor me, the coolest part is how easy it makes reliving your trips. Like instantly pulling up a photo of the amazing ramen you had in Tokyo months ago, instead of digging through thousands of random pictures.\nThe app doesn't even require an account, so you can use it right away. It's only available on Android at the moment.\nIf this sounds interesting, I’d love for you to try it and let me know what you think. Any feedback is appreciated!

After some initial testing, we were genuinely amazed by the results, it felt like magic!

Bodo is powered by an auto-parallelizing JIT compiler and an HPC backend, enabling it to generate highly optimized, parallel binaries (MPI) for Pandas and NumPy code—all without requiring any code rewrites.\nOur latest benchmark demonstrates 20x to 240x speedup over traditional distributed computing frameworks like Spark, Ray, and Dask (code and details in repo).\nThe inspiration for Bodo came from my background in HPC, when I saw how extremely slow and hard to use Spark was (has gotten better over the years but still not great). Of course, a compiler has its own limitations (e.g. not all Python is compilable), but I think it’s leaps and bounds better.\nLet me know what you think.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42452799\nPoints: 8\n# Comments: 2",

I've built a new interface for bioRxiv+medRxiv to directly browse preprint findings on the genome!\nTo begin I downloaded 7TB's of bioRxiv+medRxiv preprints and extracted mentions of genetic variant ID's or positions. Documented in \"How to download bioRxiv on a budget\": http://sitlabs.org/writing/biorxiv.html\nThis project started after I was trawling through Google Scholar to review a gene when I realised I had missed relevant upstream findings which hadn't been linked to the gene. I wondered if there could be a better interface to explore genetic literature?\nNext I provided the variant mentions and paper context to gpt-4o-mini and requested structured output summarising the scientific finding. Finally I mapped all variants to the latest genome build and plotted them on our custom genome browser.\nThis project was made by the new Scientific Interface & Tooling Lab (http://sitlabs.org) at Oxford.

I created this to help myself by simulating tough scenarios using AI.\nWith Tough Tongue AI, you can stumble, stammer, and say the weirdest stuff—then try again until you nail it. No judgment, no sweaty palms, and definitely no awkward pauses...okay, maybe a few, the AI is still far from perfect, but it’s all part of the fun!\nIt has been helpful and given me confidence to have those conversations I've been avoiding!

I'm back with an update on this post [0].\nLast year, I quit my corporate job and went full-time on ProjectionLab, the long-term financial planning app I've been building for the past 4 years, which some of you may recognize. The decision to go all-in felt like a huge leap. But it was the right call, and it's been a good year.\nAnd without the HN community, it would not have happened. As I mentioned last time [0], the feedback on my original Show HN is THE reason I'm still here working on this. I'm really grateful for that. And I hope the way I’ve grown PL -- staying bootstrapped and focused on users -- resonates with the early supporters who helped to shape it.\nFor now I'm still the only engineer, burning the candle at both ends, but luckily I'm not feeling burnt out myself!\nI…",

          "description": "While building SaaS products, we noticed a recurring problem: content performance hinges on the first few words. Hooks determine success, but defining and generating effective hooks programmatically is hard.\nHere’s how we approached the challenge:\n1. The problem:\nAttention is subjective and context-dependent. Identifying patterns that consistently work across platforms is complex.\n2. Our approach:\n- Data collection: Analyzed high-performing LinkedIn posts, social media ads, and email subject lines.\n- Lightweight NLP system: Developed a system to identify linguistic patterns like structure, emotional triggers, and readability.\n- Fine-tuned GPT models to generate hooks based on frameworks observed in the data.\n3. Tech challenges we tackled:\n- Balancing creativity and relevance to ensure hooks are engaging without veering into clickbait.\n- Building 15+ adaptable frameworks such as curiosity-driven questions, data-backed insights, and emotional prompts.\n- Iterating with user feedback to refine hook quality and ensure consistent results.\nThe result is a system that identifies attention-grabbing patterns and generates hooks that perform well across platforms.\nWe’re actively building out new features and optimizations. If you have feedback on our approach, the tech, or ideas to explore, we’d love to hear from you.

The killer feature is that we use LLMs and user-defined goals to provide the best possible blocking experience.\nThe decision-making process is not binary, we have multiple categories, allowing for more nuanced user interactions. This makes the browsing experience much less frustrating compared to other website blockers.\nSites like Reddit or YouTube are not always bad, and Wikipedia or other educational resources are not always good. By considering what the user is working on, we are able to make more informed and effective decisions.\nOther blockers rely on pre-made blocklists for distracting websites. This approach is clearly insufficient for most use cases, as curating such lists is tedious—whether for the developer or the user.\nWe've also added quality-of-life features, including whitelists, blacklists, active hours, temporary unblocking, nuclear mode and a well-integrated (and optional) Pomodoro timer.\nLearnings:\nInitially, we scraped page content to make decisions. However, this approach posed significant privacy concerns. Now, all our decisions are based on tab metadata, ensuring a much better level of privacy and much better performance. No page content is transferred to the server.\nData collection:\nWe don't store browsing data unless the user explicitly reports incorrect decisions, BYOB model version will be released soon as well based on user demand.\nLinks:\n[1] https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hedge-ai-powered-di...\n[2] https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hedge-ai-dist...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42449837\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I recently tried out an AI-driven tool called Cora Intelligence, and it’s been a game-changer for lead generation. Instead of working with a preloaded database or enriching a list of existing leads, it lets you input your industry and generates fresh leads tailored to your needs.\nThe standout feature is its AI-driven data customization—you can request specific details like product prices or summaries in plain language, and the tool retrieves the information for you. It even includes a chatbot where you can ask follow-up questions about any lead and get answers instantly, saving a ton of time on manual research.\nDoes anyone know of other tools that combine lead generation with AI-powered data enrichment and instant chat-based queries?

          "description": "I created a web framework called kinekt and would like to introduce it to the community. Kinekt is a TypeScript-first, high-performance web framework built on web standards. It has the following features which set it apart from other frameworks in the javascript realm:\n- It is 100% type safe. It supports the use of zod schemas to declare endpoints\n- It has great DX. It auto-infers a client function for every endpoint you declare, making it extremely useful for developing full-stack web apps which are completely written in TypeScript\n- It is highly modular. The middleware engine is unlike most other existing implementations and follows a functional-style paradigm\nIt is still in early development stages.

Listen to incoming events or trigger workflows manually.\nBehind the scenes:\n1. Each workflow runs as a durable, long-running execution.\n2. AI agents within the same workflow share memory.\n3. AI agents associate different channels, such as Slack threads or Gmail email threads, with workflows and can understand when replies are linked to specific workflow executions.\nTry it out:\nhttps://tryworkloop.com\nThere will be bugs!!

          "description": "I made this app for myself, but it's probably worth sharing.\nWhen I tried to find a nice app that I could use to check air quality multiple times a day, I was shocked. All of them looked boring with traffic-light coding and overcrowded with unnecessary data. On top of that, they either contained ads or required payment.\nI didn't want to use any of those apps every day, so I thought, \"Well, how hard could it be?\" and accepted the challenge. I expected to finish development in a month, but since I'm a designer and don't normally program apps, I had to learn Swift on the go. This required a month more than I expected.\nIn my designs, I'm usually way too focused on efficiency. Since this was my personal project, I wanted to experiment, so I didn't use standard controls or color coding.\nInspired by avant-garde style, I used forms and movement to convey air quality, as well as an asymmetrical layout and overflowing visualizations. I enjoy using the app, and I hope you will, too.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42446515\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

You can manage your job search more effectively by populating your professional connections and tracking companies of interest. Once set up, you can deploy it to a server to continuously scrape new job postings and share them directly to a Discord channel via free webhooks. This makes it easy to stay updated on relevant opportunities in real-time.\nWhy I made this?:\nLinkedIn sucks, their email blasts are often spammy and filled with irrelevant listings. On top of that, if you’re relying solely on mainstream platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed, it’s nearly impossible to be first in line for a newly posted opportunity. It scrapes company job boards directly, ensuring you’re notified of opportunities the moment they go public.\nStill making improvements everyday but you can give it a try using Homebrew (macOs) or install via Cargo (windows, linux).

          "description": "I started this project because I believe MCP has the potential to transform how AI models interact with external resources, but the ecosystem is still very fragmented. There's no central place to discover and compare all the server implementations available, which makes adoption and experimentation harder for developers.\nI initially built the GitHub repo awesome-mcp-servers (https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers/), and it's been amazing to see the community contribute to it. Now, I'm taking it further with a directory that automates many tasks—introspecting servers to determine the tools, resources, and prompts they provide, inferring required configurations, and checking dependencies for vulnerabilities. These features are designed to make it easier for people to trust and use these servers in production environments.\nWhile an open-source protocol is fantastic for innovation, I also think we need a centralized channel for addressing critical issues like security vulnerabilities, dependency management, and user support. My hope is that this directory not only grows with help from contributions, but also becomes a trusted resource for anyone entering the MCP space. If you're working on MCP servers or are interested in the project, I'd love to hear your thoughts!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42443069\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hello HN!\nIn a recent \"Ask HN: What are you working on?\" thread, I mentioned I was working on OCRing a large book:\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41971614\nThe post generated some interest so I thought I would keep HN posted.\nThe book is Saint-Simon’s Memoirs -- an invaluable historical account of the French court under Louis XIV, full of wit, sharp observations, and of incredible literary value. I'm OCRing the edition of reference made between 1879-1930, that contains a lot of comments and footnotes: 45 volumes, ~27,000 pages.\nHere's a link to a blog post that describes the techniques used so far (the project is still ongoing):\nhttps://blog.medusis.com/38_Adventures+in+OCR.html\nBut you may also directly access the result here:\nhttps://divers.medusis.net/boislisle/pub\nThis web app (not optimized for mobile, sorry) solves a tricky problem of preloading images efficiently. In short: preloading the next image isn't enough, since browsers will repaint if an image is moved, or scaled. Or browsers won't paint at all if visibility is hidden or opacity is zero, and will paint only when those values change. On an average, slow machine, this takes visible time. But if an image is simply behind another element, it will be painted, and the removal of the covering element or changing the z-index will not trigger a repaint.\n(Preloading is important because it lets one review results fast; if one has to wait 150-200 ms between images it's simply discouraging).\nWould love to hear feedback; happy to answer any question!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42443022\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "We built a way to go from requirements to a fully working admin panel/internal tool -type application within minutes. As a user you provide the various entities and their relationship plus any reports or dashboard widgets and it will generate it for you.\nThe problem with existing no code tools is that you still need to spend a lot of time building after figuring out what is needed (a problem of its own). Being able to focus on what is needed means you can build faster than designing, dragging, dropping, configuring.\nWhat can you describe? Everything from tables, field types, relationships between tables and columns/fields, role-based access restrictions (RBAC), reports, dashboard metrics, bar/line/pie charts, lists.\nThis is made possible by fine-tuning Llama 3.1 to convert requirements into specs and code. Applications evolve over time and this means that the model has to be predictable between versions to ensure that the data/schema migrations can be generated cleanly, as well as provide any errors and warnings related to the requirements or data loss.\nFor non-developers this can be a huge time-saver since you don't have to use any additional developer resources. For developers it can be a great way to get 80+% of the way for complex apps (it's like super-scaffolding). Generated apps can be fully evaluated before purchase. A full git repo containing the back-end, front-end, migrations, etc. is the output of the entire process.\nCurrently the generated code base is TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next.js but the capability is there to generate different stacks because of the approach taken to not go directly to code when fine-tuning.\nBrought to you by the team at Red Axle (https://redaxle.com)\nCheck out the video at https://youtu.be/rPppwB4jPlQ for a smaller app.\nWe look forward to your thoughts. Does building apps this way make sense for the super savvy HN crowd?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42442879\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

That’s why I decided to build an end-to-end solution that could take care of data ingestion, transformation, and Python stuff.

          "description": "Hi HN! Agora is a search engine for e-commerce products. We've indexed 4 million products sold on 8,100 Shopify and WooCommerce stores and made them easy to purchase with a single cart transaction. Think of a decentralized Amazon.\nI originally launched Agora as a side project here on HN to find a pair of red shoes for my wife last Christmas. I quickly realized that some of the best products on the internet are sold by small online stores that struggle to get the same visibility as large retailers. I started Agora on a mission to solve this problem. If you sell the best pair of red shoes in the world, customers should be able to find it.\nWe recently built a merchant dashboard that helps Shopify and WooCommerce merchants sell more on our search engine. Agora Merchants connects to your existing e-commerce store without any painful setup required and helps you track your store's performance on Agora. We don't take a commission of sales, orders are routed to your existing point of sale system, and inventory is automatically uploaded and refreshed. We do this with a combination of crawlers and AI agents.\nSo how is this different than Amazon? Both Amazon and Agora give network effects to stores (i.e. if you're searching for red shoes from one store, you may also want to buy a red dress sold by a different store). The key difference with Agora is that you continue selling on your existing e-commerce store, without having to manage inventory and payouts on another platform. This creates a magical experience for our merchants that saves them hundreds of hours. We believe in a future where merchants can sell however they want, we just bring them more customers.\nI'd love your feedback!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42441895\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi HN, I've been working on building AI agents and ended up building a tool to easily chain together prompts, vector db, function call, ReAct agentic flows etc. I am doing a soft launch today, mainly because I want to get feedback.\nHow acris.ai works:\n1. Each step is an LLM prompt that you can chain together and execute. You can choose the type of a step: Text, JSON, Function Call, ReAct Agent, Vector DB etc.\n2. Deploy it as a web application or JSON API\n3. All free for now. Will implement usage based charging later\nFeedback is welcome.\nIf you want to try it out, sign up here:\nhttps://app.acris.ai\nHow to use\nhttps://x.com/siraj_hs/status/1868986296372543912\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42441082\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

This allows for easy and permanent local storage, searchability, and integration with note-taking applications like Obsidian (which I use). If you sync again after continuing conversations, ChatKeeper will find your conversation files — even if you've moved or renamed them — and update them in place, so you can reorganize them to your heart's content.\nMany of my conversations have some lasting value, e.g. for reference or as part of a larger project.

I built Savvy so you can capture and share your CLI solutions in seconds.\nWith a simple savvy record history command, you can:\n   - Go back in time and cherry pick commands from your shell history\n   - Automatically expand aliases\n   - Redact sensitive information locally\n   - Convert hard-coded values into runtime placeholders\n   - Export locally to markdown files or create shareable team workflows using Savvy.\n\nSome FAQs\nQ) How Does Savvy’s CLI work?\n   Savvy’s CLI uses shell hooks (full support for bash and zsh. Fish support is in beta) to capture commands. Savvy’s CLI never looks at any command outputs or active keystrokes. Users have to explicitly opt-in (by typing savvy record/savvy record history) to capture commands every single time.\n\n   Once you select a particular workflow with savvy run, savvy starts a new sub-shell and walks you through each step of the way. No manual copy paste or editing commands to provide run time values.\n\n   Demo: https://getsavvy.so/demo\n\n   Savvy takes your redacted commands as input and uses Llama 3.x hosted on Groq to create a first draft of your workflow.\n\n   Savvy ask/explain are powered by  GPT 4/GPT4o to convert natural language to shell commands and vice-versa.\n\n   GitHub: https://github.com/getsavvyinc/savvy-cli\n   Demo: https://getsavvy.so/demo\n   Docs: https://docs.getsavvy.so/guides/quick_start/\n   Example workflows: https://getsavvy.so/#examples\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42436589\nPoints: 15\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I'm exited to share this project I've been working on with you. Simply, it makes productivity and studying instantly rewarding and engaging from the start, increasing the chance of consistency in the long term.\nYou can start \"training sessions\" which are the timers where you are meant to focused. During this, if you are studying you can take AI generated quizzes based on certain subjects. Right now its a dropdown selection of set topics as I'm not sure of the safety of allowing people to type whatever they want to the AI, but I might change that.\nAfter the training sessions, based on the time trained and the team you have built, you receive points. These points can be used to build up your team by opening packs of various rarities. With this, you feel rewarded from getting points and being productive instantly. Along with this, you can join 'leagues' which are rooms with other people to compete to be the best. Also, you can compete in real time matches against others to make your team have more worth than show.\nIts publicly released but I'm still improving it daily and all I would like is for people to use it and give feedback, good or bad. Thank you!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42436497\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I got approached by the finance department of a large company. There is a new regulation in Europe that mandates a defined XML-format for e-invoices for some transactions and - I kid you not - their SAP implementation wasn't able to address this. They also said that all solutions on the market were either cumbersome (think: manually typing in all fields) or required deep system integration.\nI thought it cannot be that hard to use AI for this and built a little invoice converter that takes your PDF invoice in whatever form it is, and outputs exactly the XML structure that is required in the regulation. Given that AI is not perfect (but surprisingly close to it!), you can manually edit all fields.\nTarget users are companies where their current solution does not yet support the standard and that do not want to change their existing invoicing flow (incl. foreign businesses).\nTrying it out is free. Given this is my first real B2B tool, would love some feedback!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42435870\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

The consensus was that I should learn to code. I disagreed with it.\nTwo weeks ago, I paid for GitHub Copilot and, with o1-preview's help, devised the plan and developed the actual code of my PWA. It works as a charm, so I, my family, and friends use it every day, precisely as planned.\nNow, I can comfortably say that I still don't know how to code, but that won't stop me and shouldn't stop any other non-coder from developing something they want anymore.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42435603\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

While the questions mostly remain the same, the answers can change and may correspond to different versions, forming a roadmap for future product success. A phenotype is the visualization of an answer, evolving as the answers change over time.\nCarton provides a framework for product scoping (not project management or product design) that makes use of this definition.\nLet's think even further. With the advent of artificial intelligence, the entire process of software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Soon, software will be created more through natural conversation than traditional programming languages.\nCarton helps ensure you always have a clear record of what you've asked from the AI and, even better, helps to request what comes next.\nIts a very early proof of concept phase.

          "description": "Hey guys,\nI wanted to show what we have been working on for the last few weeks. We have done data extraction/web scraping for the last few months, and we built this internally to help us. However, clients requested a SAAS tool, so here it is!\nYou guys can test it out here (app.potarix.com). Everyone who signs up gets 5$ credits. Scraping each page takes up $0.10 of your credits. You are not charged for unsuccessful scrapes!\nWe launched last week, and our platform was super buggy. We initially launched without the concept of \"jobs\" in our product, so every time you wanted to scrape a platform, you would have to wait 5 minutes on one screen to get your results. Something is bound to happen in those 5 minutes, so the task would fail for some unknown reason.\nLooking ahead, we built stuff in-house that we would love to include in the SAAS platform shortly. We have built functionality to click, type, scroll, etc. on the page. AI also tends to be wrong sometimes, so we created a tweakable script in the backend to control the agent's actions. That way, you are in control and can bring the script to 100% accuracy. We have also seen people battling to build infrastructure for their large-scale scraping projects. We wanna autonomously let folk set up parallelization and choose the infra for their project so everything is scraped as quickly and succinctly as possible from the SAAS.\nIf any of these future features sound interesting, feel free to book some time, and we can discuss how we can help you with these now!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42435480\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hey HN, I’ve been working on this multiplayer crossword for a while now. There’s still so much more on my todo list for it, but I think it’s time to launch and get some feedback with what I have.\nEvery hour, a new crossword (13×13 or 15×15) is generated at https://crosswordracing.com If you prefer smaller/faster, every ten minutes, a new mini crossword (7×7 or 11×11) is generated at https://crosswordracing.com/mini\nYou’re playing each crossword at the same time as everyone else, racing to complete it first. You can’t see what you’ve got right, until you correctly complete the entire grid. But you get some fun feedback on what other players are doing: a cell turns green if one other player has correctly solved it, orange if two other players have, and red if three or more other players have entered the correct letter in that cell.\nChat is emoji-only for the first half of the game (i.e. 30 minutes for the front-page, 5 minutes for the mini). After that, it unlocks and you can chat freely.\nIf you’re not done when the next crossword is generated, you can just stay on the current page for as long as you like and keep working to solve it.\nI didn’t manage to get user accounts done before my arbitrarily-imposed launch date, so everyone is anonymous for now. I definitely want to build accounts, streaks, trophies, etc. The other big thing I’m excited to build is a “team mode”. You should be able to play on a team, where you can chat freely with your team-mates, and the cell colors indicate what the other team has (collaboratively) got correct. I think that would be a lot of fun.\nThanks for reading, checking it out, and for any feedback. Feel free to ask me anything, of course.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42434157\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

You'll get notifications (email + app) when significant events matching your criteria are detected. For short-term projects, you'll be notified when your analysis is ready.\nBehind the scenes:\nWhen you give the AI Assistant a request to monitor an entity (like a stock or group of stocks), an AI Project Manager plans the project and breaks the project down into manageable tasks. These tasks run asynchronously - some recurring (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly), others one-time.\nExample prompts you can try:\nLong-term monitoring:\n- \"Monitor Apple stock and notify me of any important events and red flags\"\n- \"Monitor Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta stock. Notify me if any of them start trending toward being undervalued\"\nShort-term analysis:\n- \"Create a project to analyze the last 30 earnings calls for Tesla, spot trends, and how the business has evolved over time\"\nYou can track the progress of all tasks as the AI Agents work in the background.\nTry it here: https://decodeinvesting.com/chat\nThis is still an early version - we're actively improving it based on feedback.

          "description": "Hey HN,\nWe’re excited to share PySpur, an open-source tool that provides a graph-based interface for building, debugging, and evaluating LLM workflows.\nWhy we built this:\nBefore this, we built several LLM-powered applications that collectively served thousands of users. The biggest challenge we faced was ensuring reliability: making sure the workflows were robust enough to handle edge cases and deliver consistent results.\nIn practice, achieving this reliability meant repeatedly:\n1. Breaking down complex goals into simpler steps: Composing prompts, tool calls, parsing steps, and branching logic.  \n2. Debugging failures: Identifying which part of the workflow broke and why.  \n3. Measuring performance: Assessing changes against real metrics to confirm actual improvement.\nWe tried some existing observability tools or agent frameworks and they fell short on at least one of these three dimensions. We wanted something that allowed us to iterate quickly and stay focused on improvement rather than wrestling with multiple disconnected tools or code scripts.\nWe eventually arrived at three principles upon which we built PySpur :\n1. Graph-based interface: We can lay out an LLM workflow as a node graph. A node can be an LLM call, a function call, a parsing step, or any logic component. The visual structure provides an instant overview, making complex workflows more intuitive.  \n2. Integrated debugging: When something fails, we can pinpoint the problematic node, tweak it, and re-run it on some test cases right in the UI.   \n3. Evaluate at the node level: We can assess how node changes affect performance downstream.\nWe hope it's useful for other LLM developers out there, enjoy!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42433689\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I’ve been on the job hunt for the past few months and after going through numerous reddit threads and Linkedin posts I saw that customized resumes make a huge difference in getting callbacks. But every tool I tried was either bloated with 50+ features I didn’t need or way too expensive (some were charging $70/month!). These people think I'm made of money!\nSo I decided to build my own AI resume builder.\nIt’s simple and streamlined:\nIt takes your resume and the job post and generates  a custom resume tailored to that post. (We do not store your resume or use it to train the AI)\nWhat used to take me 20-30 minutes now takes 30 seconds.\nI’ve gotten callbacks from companies like Apple, Nvidia, Meta, and Amazon using it.\nThe pricing is designed to be accessible: the more jobs you apply to, the cheaper it gets — around $2 per resume.\nI'd love for you to try it out and let me know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42433683\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",
