          "description": "Wendy's Wednesday Meal of Misfortune is a meal themed after the Wednesday Netflix show. It includes 10 chicken nuggets (classic or spicy), two random mystery dipping sauces (\"Dips of Dread\" because they're spicy), small fries, and a small \"Raven's Blood\" Frosty.\n\nThe meal cost me $9.99.\n\n\n\nThe Wednesday Meal of Mistfortune is the same as a small 10-piece nuggets combo (which costs $9.79 at the same location), but with the new mystery dipping sauces and the new Frosty instead of a fountain drink.\nThe chicken nuggets were hot with a good crispiness and moist interior. I went with the classic version to better get a taste for the sauces.\n\n\n\nI received a dark red sauce that looked like a berry sauce, but turned out to be a spicy ketchup (a spicy berry sauce would have been more interesting), and a greyish pink sauce that turned out to be a spicy mayo. Interestingly, the ketchup was slightly spicier, but both were medium in terms of heat. Flavorwise, there wasn't more than you typically get from ketchup or mayo. There wasn't any extra hit of seasonings or herbs. They went well enough with the nuggets and the fries.\n\n\n\nThe Raven's Blood Frosty is available with a Vanilla or Chocolate Frosty base and is swirled with a dark cherry sauce. It came with a themed purple spoon. I went with the chocolate but regretted it. It was fine when I ate some Chocolate Frosty by itself, and the cherry sauce by itself had an enjoyable sweet cherry flavor. However, eating the two together made my mouth unhappy. The combination just wasn't jiving. I think the chocolate was too mild, maybe.\n\n\n\nOverall, Wendy's Wednesday Meal of Misfortune turned out nicely from a thematic standpoint. There was a special bag and all the food came in themed containers--even the stylized spoon came in a special wrapper. The new dips (I was only able to try two out of four, and they're given randomly), while interesting in terms of appearance, were less so in terms of taste.\nRead more at Brand Eating!",
