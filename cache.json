          "description": "Even before kickoff, the final of the NCAA men's soccer championship was special as a meeting between two underdogs. Marshall, which won its first title in the 2020 season as an unseeded team, was the 13th seed this year and reached the final by defeating the No. 1 Ohio State. Meanwhile, unseeded Vermont beat two-seed Pitt and three-seed Denver on its way to the title game. The Thundering Herd and Catamounts put together a real thriller Monday night, as Vermont won its first championship in program history on a sudden-death goal in overtime.\nThat goal is at the 7:56 mark of the highlight reel below, though the entire second half of the match was very dramatic. Marshall took a 1-0 lead in the 57th minute after Vermont keeper Niklas Herceg mishandled a tough cross right into the path of Tarik Pannholzer. Herceg kept his team in it with a beautiful save minutes later, and in the 81st minute, Marcell Papp took advantage of a poor clearance from Marshall keeper Aleksa Janjic to start and finish a one-two with a shot from just inside the box. You're here for the winner, though. In overtime, centerback Zach Barrett intercepted a pass in the Vermont half and smacked a speculative longball for Maximilian Kissel. The forward shrugged off his defender, then dribbled around Janjic and scored.",

Instead, once she had accumulated what she decided were too many clothes, she would do a massive purge of her closet—only to fill it back up again. It's an interminable cycle: Buying a new thing is the answer to your emotional issue du jour, that is until you've unintentionally filled your home with too many things, at which point the only thing you can do to feel better is to purge. \nOnce Chamberlain had ruthlessly evaluated each of the pieces in her closet, what she was left with, to her surprise, was a sort of capsule wardrobe, a deliberately small, curated collection of clothing intended to be worn interchangeably. That Chamberlain, uber-influencer and proprietor of a 12 million–follower YouTube channel, has gone capsule is indicative of the sustaining appeal of the concept, and I believe indicates an attempt to exert aesthetic control in a time of marked economic and social instability.",

          "description": "So far, the person who killed United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson seems to have gotten what he wanted. It has been 13 days since Thompson was gunned down on a Manhattan street, and at this point the murder has been rather comfortably situated as an act of political violence. Authorities have charged a man named Luigi Mangione with the crime, and if a note he was carrying with him at the time of his arrest is to be believed, Thompson was killed as a response to the cruelty and depravity of the American healthcare industry, which has since become an urgent topic of conversation in American media and culture.\nEvidence of the killer’s victory can be found on any news channel, or in any number of mainstream publications. There was a brief period of time when one could get away with dismissing the enthusiasm that swelled around Mangione’s alleged act as something that only existed in the unreality of the internet—the byproduct of a small, irony-poisoned segment of the country that best understands how to use social media as a megaphone. If that enthusiasm ever was contained, it has since escaped: SNL is now a safe place to joke about Thompson’s death, and respectable publications like The New Yorker and New York Magazine have acknowledged Mangione’s folk-hero status. The effectiveness of the killing can also be found in reactions from those in the government. New York Governor Kathy Hochul has convened a “safety summit” for New York CEOs, and Florida authorities charged a mother with making terroristic threats for saying “delay, deny, depose” (the words Mangione allegedly wrote on his shell casings) during a phone call with her insurance provider. Senator Elizabeth Warren evidently takes the groundswell of support for Mangione seriously enough to pander to those who sympathize with him. She recently went on TV to say, “Violence is never the answer … but you can only push people so far.”",

          "description": "The Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers appear to have refreshed their mojo. It was never far gone, although consecutive home-and-away losses to the Atlanta Hawks confer a soupçon of illegitimacy so long as the Hawks remain the only team in the NBA to have lost twice to the abominable three-win Washington Wizards. The Cavaliers appear to have recovered from the wobble, and this is all normal basketball business in November and December, but it's enough to say that the team regressed after the best start in franchise history. That was inevitable. The questions had to do with how far their form would dip—are they as capable of excruciating lows as they are of rarified highs—and where precisely they'd sit in the league hierarchy once they'd settled.\nThat is possibly the most hedged and evasive basketblog lede ever written about a team with just four losses a third of the way through an NBA regular season. Part of that, I swear, is an effort to contain my own excitement about this Cavaliers team. I find them very easy to like, notwithstanding the few minutes every game that Donovan Mitchell spends waving his personal stamp around like a crazed mail clerk. Monday night they beat the absolute hell out of the Brooklyn Nets, recovering from a quick opening deficit with a vicious 16–0 run and then pouring it on, so that the final 39 minutes or so of a 48-minute contest were treated like an exhibition. Cleveland's scoring efficiency was downright unreasonable: The four starters not named Donovan Mitchell combined for 56 points and missed just five total shots and one free throw between them. Caris LeVert and Georges Niang drilled 8 of 14 three-point attempts off the bench. Without anyone even having a standout performance, the Cavs breezed to 130 points, and only Darius Garland kicking the ball around uncharacteristically and Sam Merrill forgetting how to shoot prevented them from sniffing 150.",

That's the question coming out of the weekend, as the four-time reigning champions suffered the latest indignity in what is now a run of eight losses in 11 games with just a single, solitary win. This latest blow came Sunday at the hands of its crosstown rivals, as Manchester United won the local derby in almost surreal fashion, turning around a first half 1-0 deficit into a two-goals-in-two-minutes late barrage to pick up the 2-1 win at City's shell-shocked stadium. The loss alone is bad enough for City, but the way that it lost, to what looked like a flaccid United side for about 98 percent of the match, will bring even more pain to Pep Guardiola and his beleaguered squad of expensive underachievers.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnnde9CMAg8",

I was feeling magnanimous and in need of some good karma. Perhaps, I reasoned, the mercy I showed this fly would return to me tenfold on some later date. I watched the fly zig-zag down my hallways and felt smugly philanthropic. How many flies got to live out the rest of their limited days on Earth in a habitat as temperate and well-attended as my pre-war apartment? Its constant buzzing, especially near my face, was annoying, and a part of me blanched each time my eyes strayed from my food, opening up the possibility for the fly to regurgitate its fly juice on my avocado toast.

          "description": "Six months out, the 2025 NBA Draft is primarily conceived of and talked about as the Cooper Flagg draft. This makes a certain degree of sense, as Flagg is a huge destroyer who has been kicking ass for Duke and looking every bit like the sort of prospect who could push NBA defense forward, someone without precedent (in draftese, he's been \"demonstrating the myriad ways he affects winning.\") But you don't need to be a basketball alien to be cool. Dylan Harper is a hyperskilled operator, the man widely projected to be selected one pick after Flagg, and the most magnetic player in college basketball.\nWhere Flagg is a somewhat idiosyncratic player, causing open confusion among NBA execs, there's zero uncertainty about the sort of professional Harper will be. He is the consummate modern point guard, someone who looks like he is playing at a pro level already. I don't really understand how college defenders are supposed to guard someone who is 6-foot-6 with a plus-four wingspan and this advanced of a ball-handler with both hands. Harper is the ideal driver, gliding both past and through defenders, who always appear to be flailing like used-car inflatable dancing guys in contrast to Harper's perfect balance. He's also shooting 36 percent from three—not an eye-popping number, but his mechanics are clean, not to mention beautiful, and that figure includes a ton of self-created step-back stuff and his recent hot stretch of 46 percent over the past four games. Harper had his big moment this past weekend, when he nailed a buzzer-beating three to down Seton Hall in an extremely competitive game.",

While it remains impossible to rebuild Juan Soto in the aggregate, \"Now we can afford to sign multiple guys\" is at least starting to pan out as true, if not necessarily in the hitting department. Of course, this blog is not about Juan Soto.\nLast week, the Yankees signed free agent Max Fried to an eight-year, $218 million contract. This at least covered the record-breaking portion of rebuilding Soto's contract in the aggregate, though instead of the more straightforward \"biggest contract in MLB history,\" it came with the qualifiers of being the largest guarantee for a left-handed pitcher. Also like Soto's contract, the contract has a large risk of being player-friendly toward the end—Soto will be 41 when his runs out; Fried is currently 30 with a spotty injury history—but the Yankees front office, like the Mets', will only cry about the final years if the team doesn't make some deep runs in the first few.",

          "description": "There's a kind of hush that is specific to old-growth suburbs, a quietness that is more vast and more inherent than any disturbance that kind of place can kick up. The place where I grew up is different in some ways than it was when I was growing up there, but that fundamental quiet is undisturbed. Things happen and make their various sounds—you'll hear a quick blurt of music when someone steps out of a bar to smoke or as people come and go from one of the restaurants downtown, cars go by and dogs get bossy on their walks and freight trains chug and honk over the New Jersey Transit lines when the commuter trains aren't running. People still live there, and people make noise. The part that is striking, and which is striking to me whenever I go back to see my parents in the house where I grew up, is how the totality of that suburban quiet swallows all this up. It's there and then it is gone, and there is maybe the wind in the trees or just nothing at all.\nI have lived in noisy places for longer than I ever lived in all that quiet, but the appeal of it isn't lost on me. I like how dark it gets at night there, and I like walking back from the train station down those quiet sidewalks and through all the old extraneous shortcuts of my youth. The last few times I've done this I have startled some deer standing around in a parking lot, as aimless and wary as I was when I did the same thing as a teenager; they stared at me but did not run. I am aware that it is a nice place to live and it was on balance a perfectly fine place to grow up. I understand why people live there. I am also under no illusions about how quickly and how thoroughly I would go insane if I were to try to do it again.",

That’s how legendary Michigan CB Charles Woodson secured the Heisman in 1997 (over betting favorite Peyton Manning), and it’s how Colorado CB/WR Travis Hunter edged out Boise State RB Ashton Jeanty for the honor on Saturday night. Hunter is even more of an offensive threat than Woodson was, amassing 92 receptions and 1,152 yards on offense this season while also serving as the Buffaloes’ shutdown corner. This man is a special talent, and the NFL Draft will reward him for it.\nNow let’s talk about Hunter’s coach, who’s a total asshole.",

This is mostly because I’ve already watched Detroit Lions RT Penei Sewell be tasked this season with executing both a hook-and-lateral and an option pass (he couldn’t find an open man and had to take the sack). Those are two jobs that professional fat guys are never entrusted with, although Sewell is a talented guy who has already proven himself a capable receiver. More to the point, who doesn’t get off seeing a 300-pound man doing shit normally reserved for men 100 pounds lighter?\nNavy head coach Brian Newberry knows what I’m talking about.

          "description": "Watch enough Hannah Hidalgo games on TV, and you’ll grow used to hearing that she plays with “joy.” Glee, I could see. Abandon, sure. But joy feels too clean and delicate a word to describe the way Hidalgo conducts herself on a basketball court: the mean mug, the wagged tongue, after a parabolic pull-up three. The screams. The screams! There is so much screaming: when she finds a teammate on the run, when she launches into someone’s shoulder at the rim, topples to the ground, and draws a foul. They convince me less of her “love for the game” than of her pure, uncut hatred for opponents.\nForget shoulder shrugs or sly smiles; Hidalgo exists on a higher plane of expression. Never has a player been so delighted to demoralize. (Perhaps I’m projecting this malevolence on account of her Instagram stories, which range from bland disavowals of same-sex marriage to the somewhat more intriguing claim that Britney Spears, Katy Perry, Beyoncé and Ariana Grande “ARE ALL WITCHES” whose music is “satanic inspired” and “designed to pull you away from the creator.” Give her credit for consistency: She’s a nut on and off the court.)",

Coming off of three unremarkable but respectable seasons in Spain, and at a crossroad of sorts in a career nearing but not yet in its final leg, Memphis Depay went left. Rather than join any of the usual suspects in one of Europe's major leagues, the Dutch forward opted instead to go to Brazil to play for Corinthians.\nIt is true that it wasn't exactly clear what the next logical step for Memphis's career would be. If redemption in the eyes of the greater soccer world was what he'd been after at Barcelona and Atlético Madrid, a chance to return to the elite and avenge himself for the lasting damage his Manchester United flameout did to his reputation, he didn't get it. So where to next? His fame, pedigree, age, status with the national team, and ambitions made for a peculiar mix, narrowing his potential options.",

          "description": "Gladiator II, Ridley Scott's sequel to Ridley Scott's Gladiator, is neither a good movie nor a bad movie—instead, it is easily one of the most movies in recent memory. Overstuffed and overacted (these are not complaints, mind you), Gladiator II has so much going on that the presence of (spoilers beyond this point) frickin' sharks in the frickin' Colosseum doesn't even make its Wikipedia summary. But look beyond the excesses of the film—easier said than done, given that a gladiator riding a rhinoceros like a surfboard appears not even halfway through—and there's another story here, one about how the politics of these films changed dramatically between the 2000 original and its 2024 sequel, and what that change says about the stories that America can still believe about itself.\nIn Gladiator, Rome is a civilizing force (the opening battle is a victory over barbarian tribes), and is on the verge of peacefully transitioning back to a republic. This version of Rome is a fundamentally virtuous nation that is threatened when Commodus, a vain and selfish degenerate, takes the reins of power instead of Maximus, the Cincinnatus-like humble general chosen by the dying emperor to return republicanism to the empire, who is subsequently exiled. It is essentially a late–Clinton-era narrative about America: A proud state has been brought low by the peccadillos of a flagrantly libertine leader who habitually disrespects the military, and the only way to return the nation to glory is for a morally upstanding political outsider (not one of those hated \"career politicians\") to defeat and remove this dishonorable interloper. And when Maximus completes his task and lays dying—term limited by Commodus's dagger—he demands that power be returned to the Senate. Even in death, Maximus was an institutionalist.",

Reporting done by The Athletic's Jeff Howe, combined with the fact that no professional team offered Belichick a job last offseason, would indicate that Belichick was forced into a college job because the NFL no longer wants him. But sources close to the man himself would like to tell a different story, and have done so through ESPN's Seth Wickersham. No, the NFL didn't turn its back on Belichick; he turned his back on it. \"This is a big fuck you to the NFL,\" is how one of Belichick's confidants described the decision to Wickersham.\nOK, sure. It doesn't really matter if any of us believe that a guy who is just 15 victories away from breaking Don Shula's all-time wins record willingly walked away from the NFL in order to coach football at a basketball school. What matters is that Belichick, and the people around him, seem to truly believe that.",

But first I should probably explain at least the basics.\nGive Me Carmelita Tropicana!, the final production for Soho Rep in its extremely intimate space on Walker Street, is a delirious supernatural caper written by Alina Troyano and Branden Jacobs-Jenkins. Troyano plays herself and Ugo Chukwu plays Jacobs-Jenkins as they chase the incorporeal title character—a real-life performance persona of Troyano's—through both New York City and a fantasy universe inhabited by Troyano's past characters. Both of the psychedelic experiences I mentioned appear before you in its intermission-free two hours (a good thing; you won't want to escape), along with so much more that can't be done justice as written words, and maybe shouldn't. The momentum and elements of surprise never falter.

          "description": "Since 2018, Christmas—or rather, XXXmas—has made a provocative, year-round statement in an Oslo traffic circle. At its center stands a 20-foot-tall (6-meter) figure, simply called Santa—a creation that has become both a curiosity and a controversy.\n\r\nThe striking red bronze sculpture, created by Los Angeles artist Paul McCarthy, has earned nicknames like the “Dildo Gnome” and “Santa with Butt Plug” because the object Santa holds—a Christmas tree—bears a suggestive resemblance to a sex toy. With exaggerated features and provocative humor, it’s impossible to miss.\n\r\nMcCarthy frames his work as a critique of Western consumerism and the holiday season’s excesses, blending high and low culture with playful irreverence. He notes that an innocent Christmas icon can carry distinctly adult undertones: while it might simply be a Christmas tree, it could also resemble a butt plug—redefining it as abstract art.\n\r\nPublic opinion in Oslo is divided: some see the statue as a tacky distraction, while others embrace its absurdity as a quirky addition to the cityscape. Even far-right organizations have voiced their disapproval, arguing that it undermines traditional values, sparking debates about artistic expression and cultural identity.\n\r\nChristian Ringnes, brewer heir and philanthropist, whose foundation funded the project, calls the statue a bold centerpiece for the area—an amusing, lively twist for an otherwise unremarkable spot. Ringnes admits he initially saw it as a jolly Santa Claus, only later recognizing its more provocative interpretations.\n\r\nOslo’s version, painted bright red and constructed from rough, horizontal slices, differs from the smooth, dark, unpainted original in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Planned for installation in 2001, the Dutch statue faced delays and was ultimately relocated a couple of times after intense backlash to its design.",

          "description": "Originating over a thousand years ago, the Nebuta Matsuri is a traditional summer festival held in several cities in Aomori Prefecture, most notably in Aomori City. Originally a lantern festival, Nebuta has since developed into a parade involving huge papier-mâché floats that mainly portray kabuki actors, mythological figures, and folk heroes.\n\r\nFounded in 2011, the Nebuta Museum Wa Rasse exhibits such floats used in the most recent festival, celebrating this unique cultural event and archiving its history. The name was chosen as the winner of a public naming competition; rasse is based on rasse-ra, the typical heave-ho shout cried out by the float-haulers, while wa has several meanings in Japanese including \"harmony\" and \"circle.\" Together, the name is also meant to evoke the word warai, or \"laughter.\"\n\r\nLocated in the Aomori Waterfront area, the museum is only a short walk from the city’s central station. The building that houses the museum is an eye-catching sight, with red vertical louvers covering its exterior and giving its entrance a look like that of a steel curtain parting to welcome visitors.\n\r\nThe museum is a dark, spacious hall filled with colorful lights coming from the Nebuta floats, showcasing traditional artistry and folklore. The papier-mâché figures are astonishingly dynamic, with flowing hair and splashing water magically brought to life.",

          "description": "Most of western Bulgaria is a moderate seismic risk zone, but it is also blessed with many hot springs. They vary in temperature and the healing mineral they naturally contain, and have been enjoyed ever since Roman times.\n\r\nIn Gorna Banya, the water has been revered for its healing nature for centuries. According to local folk tales, the waters had restored the once-abandoned village and healed a hunting dog from the valley of Sofia.\n\r\nIn 1922, a modern bathhouse with separate bathing areas and medical facilities was built, replacing an old Ottoman building. The ornate brick structure was designed in a late Vienna Secession style, with reinforced concrete domes and stone statues.\n\r\nPublic bathing culture started to decline in the 1960s as bathrooms became commonplace in new buildings, and collapsed further after the fall of the communist regime, as government subsidies for public baths dried out, leaving all but a few profitable structures closed and abandoned. The Gorna Banya bath house was no exception.\n\r\nToday, the beautiful abandoned structure is a shadow of its former self. Yet contrary to most of its abandoned counterparts, it rarely falls completely silent. The water that once gave it life now flows freely right next to it, in a public fountain that attracts those who still seek the town's mineral-rich waters.",

          "description": "Located near Kilmartin in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, Poltalloch House is a significant 19th-century mansion now in ruins. Constructed between 1849 and 1853, the house was designed by William Burn, a prominent architect known for his work in the Scottish Baronial style. Built for the Malcolm family, who were influential landowners in the area, the mansion features characteristic elements of the style, including turrets, battlements, and crow-stepped gables.\n\r\nThe house's decline began during World War II when it was requisitioned by the military. The wartime use led to significant wear and tear. After the war, the high costs of maintenance and changing economic circumstances contributed to the mansion's abandonment in the mid-20th century. Over time, Poltalloch House fell into disrepair, with its roof collapsing and interior largely destroyed.\n\r\nToday, Poltalloch House stands as a ruin. While no full restoration has been undertaken, there have been efforts to stabilize the structure to prevent further deterioration. Despite its dilapidated state, the house remains an important example of William Burn’s architectural work and the Scottish Baronial style that was popular in the Victorian era. It is fascinating to view the way in which nature has taken over the ruins with many trees and vines running over the crumbling structures. The mansion and the surrounding estate are historically significant to the region, reflecting the social and economic history of Scotland’s aristocracy.",

          "description": "Although far from the European front lines, the then-British colony of Sierra Leone was important to the war effort in both world wars. In World War I, the Royal West African Frontier Force served in operations against German forces in then-Togoland. In World War II, the strategic location of the port of Freetown meant it was fortified and became a critical base for protecting sea routes to the Middle East, India, and Australasia.\n\r\nThe vast majority of these forces were native Africans, many of them Sierra Leonean. Sierra Leoneans served as soldiers in the Frontier Force, and an even larger number served in the Carrier Corps. Combat in the African interior relied on vast quantities of materiel, but a lack of roads and mechanization meant that often the only effective method of transport was on the heads of the Carrier Corps.\n\r\nSierra Leonean forces saw combat from East Africa to Italy, and faced a grim death toll. Besides death in combat, many hundreds died of sicknesses including dysentery, tuberculosis, and especially malaria.

But while the city is famous for its restaurants, much of what makes its cuisine so unique has been lost in the rush of international brands and blandly Spanish dining concepts meant to appeal to tourists and digital nomads.\n\r\nTo this day, Barcelona’s identity is tied to Catalonia, a semi-autonomous region with its own language, culture, anthem, and gastronomy. Despite being part of Spain for well over five centuries, Catalan people are still fiercely proud of their own distinct traditions.

Designed to protect up to 150 workers, the structure, however, ultimately went unused, as Sweden remained largely untouched by the war.\n\r\nWhile relatively common in wartime Germany, this type of above-ground bunker is believed to be the only one of its kind in Sweden. Drawing on the pioneering work of engineer Leo Winkel, known for creating Winkeltürme (“Winkel Towers”) or Spitzbunker (“Pointed Bunkers”), the structure embodies both functionality and creativity. \n\r\nThe air raid shelter’s tall, narrow, circular base, with a metal-reinforced pointed top, was crafted to be nearly invisible to enemy bombers and exceptionally difficult to destroy. Even a direct hit would cause the payload to glance off the surface, rather than penetrating the walls.\n\r\nOvergrown with vines, the Spetsbunker remains a stoic sentinel. Though closed to the public, its weathered interior features a spiral staircase, platforms, and a central shaft with a winch. Its distinctive silhouette continues to serve as both a historical landmark and a reminder of wartime innovation.",

One thing that hasn't changed much over time though, is the urge to put art on the bottom of the boards. You can see this in the collection at the Geneva Skateboard Museum, which showcases boards from different eras of skateboarding.\n\r\nThe museum is made and run by Jim Zbinden, who has had the dream of this museum in mind for nearly 30 years. The first iteration of the museum came in the early 2000s. Hundreds of skateboards were displayed to show the intricate and unique art that has been a part of skateboarding culture for the last seven decades. \n\r\nIn the museum's current location, you'll find three floors where each inch of wall and ceiling space is covered with skateboards and skateboard paraphernalia. The collection has everything from old used boards to new display boards to boards that belonged to famous skaters like Tony Hawk. This makes the museum interesting even for those who have never touched a skateboard in their lives.",

Located in Jiufen—a mountain town famous for its mist-shrouded scenery, narrow alleyways, and vibrant tea houses—the museum immerses visitors in the spiritual and supernatural aspects of Taiwanese culture.\n\r\nWhile the museum only includes a couple of rooms, it is full of items and statues that showcase the diverse types of spirits and ghosts prominent in Taiwanese and East Asian folklore. It features iconic spirits like the gui (ghosts of those who suffered an unjust or tragic death) and jiangshi (the “hopping” vampires of Chinese myth). Explanatory panels accompany life-sized models, artifacts, and illustrations, offering a glimpse into the roles these spirits play in Taiwanese belief systems and rituals. Hidden inside a cabinet, a grotesque Krasue—a Southeast Asian demon with the internal organs exposed and connected to a flying female head—welcomes the visitor by repeating what they said while opening the door.\n\r\nOne of the highlights is the depiction of the Hungry Ghost Festival, an important event in Taiwan and other East Asian countries, when it’s believed that the gates of the underworld open, allowing spirits to visit the living. This exhibit showcases offerings, lanterns, and other ceremonial objects used to appease wandering souls, along with life-sized models that recreate festival scenes.\n\r\nThe museum displays a collection of traditional talismans, amulets, and symbols that people use to ward off evil spirits or attract good luck, especially related to Taoism. Visitors can learn about the symbolism behind each item and how they’re used in rituals to protect against misfortune or mischief from vengeful spirits, including a sword made of coins used by Taoist exorcists.\n\r\nThe place is built as an open photo booth, where visitors can take pictures while using the items around, lying inside coffins, or joining a set of heads inside jars.",

          "description": "While virtually every city has a tree that can claim to be the oldest, not many have a story as interesting as the one in Paris. Located in Square René Viviani within sight of the Notre Dame, an ancient black locust tree grows behind a wire fence. Surrounded by vibrant moss and saplings, its age is given away by the (somewhat poorly) camouflaged concrete struts that help support its heavier branches.\n\r\nSomething surprising about the oldest tree in the French capital is that it's not actually French. It was brought from Appalachia by the Parisian botanist Jean Robin, who found that many North American plants were suited to the temperate French climate. The entire genus of locust trees was later named for Robin, giving the Parisian tree the scientific name Robinia pseudoacacia. (The “pseudo” comes from the fact that while similar to acacias, the robinia is not closely related.)\n\r\nThe introduction of these trees to Europe has been somewhat of a mixed bag. It grows fast and strong, so it has been used to repopulate deforested areas and to provide lumber. The flowers are used in a surprising amount of foodstuffs, from teas, pancakes, and fritters to the renowned acacia honey. As they are quite shady, pollution-resistant, and long-lived, they became a popular fixture along city streets. It is this hardiness, however, that also makes it a pest.\n\r\nIn many parts of Europe, uncontrolled black locust growth has made it classified as an invasive species. Australia and South Africa have deemed it a weed. Even in North America, it can be considered invasive as it spreads away from the Appalachian region and converts native grasslands into forests. While there have been efforts to eliminate the spread of black locust to areas where it isn’t wanted, Paris does its best to keep its patient zero alive. The crutches that hold up its branches give the impression that the old tree might be a couple of centuries past its prime. Time will tell how long it holds its impressive title.",

In fact, the area is part of the UNESCO World Heritage site that includes the Alhambra. Businesses in this area tend to cater to tourists, but the Palacio de los Olvidados (Palace of the Forgotten) has taken a rather unique approach.\n\r\nThe 16th-century mansion sits in a narrow alleyway on the lower hillside of the neighborhood. The structure features four floors with a patio on the third floor that provides nice views of the Alhambra and a small fenced-in courtyard on the ground level. However, if the building did not operate as a tourism business, it would largely blend into the cityscape.\n\r\nThe ground floor of the Palacio de los Olvidados features a performance space named Palacio Flamenco. Granada is located in Andalucia, where flamenco originated from the intermingling of Muslim, Jewish, and Gitano cultures within the region, and these performances are quite popular.\n\r\nThe upper floors of the building feature a torture museum called the Museo de la Inquisición (Museum of the Inquisition). This space includes full replicas of many of the types of instruments of torture used during the medieval era but especially by the Spanish Inquisition after the Reconquista. The highlights include an iron maiden, a spiked interrogation chair, and a brazen bull (a metal statue of a bull where a person would be shut inside and then roasted alive by a fire lit below the statue). Additional special exhibitions are organized on the museum's top floors.\n\r\nWhile the combination of these attractions may seem completely incongruous, this combination makes the Palacio de los Olvidados stand out from the crowd.",

          "description": "Jack in the Box's Sourdough Smashed Jack features a quarter-pound smashed beef patty, American cheese, pickles, grilled onions, and Boss Sauce (a burger sauce that's also found on the Smashed Jack) served on grilled sourdough rounds.\n\nI paid $8.59 for one and it's basically the Smashed Jack but one grilled sourdough rather than a brioche bun. For whatever reason, they fully wrapped the burger and then placed it in a clamshell box.\n\n\nThe beef patty offered a robust meaty flavor. It was thick but just a tad short in width to achieve full bread coverage. The grind was a little too fine for a burger. There was a nice browned crust on the patty but none of the crunch you might get from a smashed patty. The temperature was warm rather than hot.\n\n\n\nThe sourdough rounds were not sour at all and only lightly crispy. They were mostly soft and chewy.\nThe American cheese was thoroughly melted and gooey.\n\n\n\nThe pickles and onions combined to provide a watery crunch. The onions were lightly sweet while the pickles added a dose of acidity. Tying it together with a combination of savory and sweet notes was the Boss Sauce.\n\n\n\nOverall, Jack in the Box's Sourdough Smashed Jack presented a solid burger that felt pricey for what you get.\nRead more at Brand Eating!",

          "description": "Gus Mueller:\nThis is a major update of Acorn, and is currently on a\ntime-limited sale for $19.99. It’s still a one time\npurchase to use as long as you’d like, and as usual, the full\nrelease notes are available. I want to highlight some of my\nfavorite things below.\n“Select Subject”, “Mask Subject”, and “Remove Background” are new\ncommands which use machine learning (or A.I. if you prefer) to\nfind the most important parts of your image, and then perform\ntheir respective operations. This has been a request for a long\ntime, and while I was doubtful of it’s utility, it’s actually\npretty fun to play with and more useful than I figured it would\nbe. So I’m glad I took the time to integrate it.\nYou can now set your measurement units to inches, centimeter, or\npixels, and it shows up across the tools for your image, not just\nspecific ones. This includes the crop palette, shape dimensions,\nfilter settings… well, pretty much everything. This might be the\noldest feature request I’ve implemented so far. And then related\nto this, Acorn 8 now has an on canvas ruler which you can use to\nmeasure out distances, straighten your image with, or even\nredefine the DPI.\nLook up Table (LUT) support. LUTs are pretty fun, and they work by\nmapping one set of colors to another, enabling consistent or\nstylized visual effects. LUTs are used primarily in photography or\nfilmmaking, and you can download and install new LUTs from various\nplaces across the internet.\nAnd more, so much more. The release notes are copious, and for me, always interesting. Acorn remains one of my most-used tools. It’s fast, reliable, powerful, extensible/scriptable, and the interface makes so much intuitive sense. That’s all been true since version 1.0 back in 2007, and that’s why it’s been my go-to image editor since it was in early beta before version 1.0 back in 2007. It’s just faster and more powerful today.\nAcorn is, simply put, one of the best Mac apps ever made. It’s that good. You’re nuts (sorry) if you don’t check it out while it’s available for just $20.\n ★",

          "description": "Blackmagic Design:\nBlackmagic Design announced it will start taking pre-orders for\nthe new Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive camera — the world’s first\ncommercial camera system designed to capture Apple Immersive Video\nfor Apple Vision Pro — today with deliveries due to start in\nearly 2025. DaVinci Resolve Studio will be updated to support\nediting Apple Immersive Video early next year, offering\nprofessional filmmakers a comprehensive workflow for producing\nApple Immersive Video for Apple Vision Pro. Apple Immersive Video\nis a remarkable 180-degree media format that leverages\nultra-high-resolution immersive video and Spatial Audio to place\nviewers in the center of the action. [...]\nBlackmagic URSA Cine Immersive features a fixed, custom lens\nsystem pre-installed on the body, which is designed specifically\nto capture Apple Immersive Video for Apple Vision Pro. The sensor\ndelivers 8160 × 7200 resolution per eye with pixel level\nsynchronization and an incredible 16 stops of dynamic range, so\ncinematographers can shoot 90fps 3D immersive cinema content to a\nsingle file. The custom lens system is designed for URSA Cine’s\nlarge format image sensor with extremely accurate positional data\nthat’s read and stored at time of manufacturing. This immersive\nlens projection data — which is calibrated and stored on device — then travels through post production in the Blackmagic RAW\nfile itself.\n$30,000 — not cheap, but not crazy. And this isn’t merely 3D in a rectangular frame — it’s 180° 8K 3D.\nDavid Smith:\nWhat really intrigues me about it is when/if it will show up for\nrental. I have a few tentative ideas in this space I’d love to\nexplore but I don’t think would justify the cost of owning one.\nLooks like Lensrentals rents a vaguely similar, traditional\nBlackmagic camera kit for around $1,000/week ... which would make\nexperimentation much more accessible.\n ★",

Google Fi is Google’s cellular phone service. I actually use it to provide service to my Android burner phone. The prices are excellent and the service is fine for my minimal needs for a phone I barely use. But Google Fi offers something called “call and voicemail sync” that lets Fi users make and answer voice calls through the web. If you enable this, you lose RCS. See Reddit threads here and here with Fi fans complaining about it.\nIt’s just wild to me that Google would spend years waging a campaign urging Apple to support RCS, yet Google itself doesn’t support RCS in its own products.\n ★",

I know sponsors are sometimes hesitant to book weeks around major holidays, but, well, Daring Fireball is never “closed”. And traffic to the site is remarkably consistent even during weeks like Thanksgiving and Christmas. Nerds get bored and want to read interesting stuff.\nQ1 2025 weeks are wide open too, but I only just now opened those weeks on the calendar.\nWeekly sponsorships have been the top source of revenue for Daring Fireball ever since I started selling them back in 2007. They’ve succeeded, I think, because they make everyone happy. They generate good money. There’s only one sponsor per week and the sponsors are always relevant to at least some sizable portion of the DF audience, so you, the reader, are never annoyed and hopefully often intrigued by them. And, from the sponsors’ perspective, they work. My favorite thing about them is how many sponsors return for subsequent weeks after seeing the results.\nIf you’ve got a product or service you think would be of interest to DF’s audience of people obsessed with high quality and good design, get in touch. And again, this coming week remains open, and the week after. I’m even offering those two weeks at a holiday discount.\n ★",

All three of these iPhone models are still\nequipped with a Lightning port for wired charging.\nIn a paywalled report today, the website said the iPhone models\nwill no longer be sold through Apple’s online store and retail\nstores in the European Union as of December 28, which is when the\nregulation goes into force.\nIt was never clear to me whether this regulation only applied to new devices, or to existing ones. But I guess it applies to existing ones. Until the expected next-gen iPhone SE ships early next year, the lowest-priced new iPhone in the EU will be the iPhone 15, which starts at $700 in the U.S. and around €860 in Europe.

But it is a weirdly glaring omission. Apple itself started promoting screenshots of the Apple Intelligence inbox categorization in Mail for Mac back in October, when the .1 OS updates shipped with the initial round of Apple Intelligence features.\nI am reliably informed that the new Mail categorization features are coming soon to iPad and Mac, which I suspect means in the .3 updates. But the first .3 betas aren’t out yet.\n ★",

We ate it during holidays, but never really enjoyed it, and certainly it never occurred to me to eat matzo on purpose beyond the 10 days or so a year when it was mandated. But is it any surprise that matzo became yassified? The latest company to tackle the unleavened market is Matzo Project, a cute, bubbe-themed brand that makes matzo good enough for even goyim to snack on: Matzo Project. It makes the usual “flats” and also meal for ball making, but may I suggest unwrapping a bag of matzo chips?  Small, wafer-like crackers that come speckled with everything seasoning, cinnamon sugar, or just salt. They’re tasty and flavorful, but their key characteristic might be their hardiness, which makes them ideal for any thick dip.\n\n\n\nNo peeking! But check out what the Eater Advent Calendar has already revealed.  And check back each day for a new clutch condiment, gadget, or nibble that, yes, makes an amazing gift — but these surprises are just for you.",

          "description": "Chef Hiroki Odo uses a wagyu blend, sansho peppercorns, sake, and tamari to create this decadent burger.\n “I thought it would be nice to make a hamburger that mixed New York and Japan,” says chef Hiroki Odo. Actually, he made six. At Hall, Odo’s “conceptual bar” in the Flatiron District, the limited menu features a selection of wagyu burgers, from a simple single cheeseburger to one topped with A5 wagyu steak. \nStep by step, general manager Brian Saito walks through crafting Hall’s burgers. He starts with a blend of Sakura Wagyu chuck and A5 wagyu, finely grinding them and controlling just how much fat is in each patty. Then there’s the sauce, a combination of sansho peppercorns, “a perfect complement for the fattiness of the wagyu,” reduced in sake and tamari. It’s a sauce, Saito says, they also use at chef Odo’s titular kaiseki restaurant next door. All of it gets piled on buns made from the chef’s own recipe, “so their key point is a sense of unity.”\nThe entire Hall menu is in service of wanting to bring a variety of experiences to New York diners, says chef Odo, and to showcase all the cuisines Japan has to offer. But, he admits, multiple concepts in one space “isn’t the kind of restaurant you could open in Japan.” A cocktail and burger bar, in front of a chef’s counter, next to a kaiseki restaurant? That’s New York. \nWatch the latest episode of Icons to see how Odo and Saito create one of New York’s best burgers.",

I know they still exist out there, half-pound bistro burgers oozing with juice, but these are not the burgers that trend, the burgers that beckon obsession on TikTok. No, the burgers I am told I want are meaty doilies, pressed nearly paper thin, ground beef fried to a crisp.\nOver the past five years or so, smash burgers have grown in national popularity. But 2024 was the year they officially peaked — and maybe jumped the shark. A genuine creativity around incorporating new flavors into smash burgers has made the inevitable turn into a mandatory menu addition for every place that is trying to be the next big thing.

It toes the line between being fancy and flavorful without having an appalling price tag. Its deep green hue is an indicator of the high-quality matcha each tin provides, but if that doesn’t convince you, the aroma — and flavor — will. This matcha is rich, floral, and subtly sweet but rounded out by mild bitterness. It’s delicious drunk straight because the matcha is already so smooth, but I also find it adds the perfect earthy bite to matcha lattes. I love to pair it with warm milk and a drizzle of vanilla bean paste for a fragrant matcha latte that is arguably better than any of the pale, $8 versions you might order at a coffee shop. One warning: Once you try this matcha, you can never go back to the cheaper stuff (nor will you want to, anyway).\n\n\n\nNo peeking!

Broadly speaking, the housewares, beauty, and stationery sections at these stores are full of great gift ideas, particularly in the “stocking stuffer” category — and particularly if your recipient is really into food.\nThis online shopping guide obviously negates the whole point of picking up extra items while you’re buying groceries, but should serve as inspiration the next time you’re pushing a cart down the aisles.

          "description": "I made this app for myself, but it's probably worth sharing.\nWhen I tried to find a nice app that I could use to check air quality multiple times a day, I was shocked. All of them looked boring with traffic-light coding and overcrowded with unnecessary data. On top of that, they either contained ads or required payment.\nI didn't want to use any of those apps every day, so I thought, \"Well, how hard could it be?\" and accepted the challenge. I expected to finish development in a month, but since I'm a designer and don't normally program apps, I had to learn Swift on the go. This required a month more than I expected.\nIn my designs, I'm usually way too focused on efficiency. Since this was my personal project, I wanted to experiment, so I didn't use standard controls or color coding.\nInspired by avant-garde style, I used forms and movement to convey air quality, as well as an asymmetrical layout and overflowing visualizations. I enjoy using the app, and I hope you will, too.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42446515\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

You can manage your job search more effectively by populating your professional connections and tracking companies of interest. Once set up, you can deploy it to a server to continuously scrape new job postings and share them directly to a Discord channel via free webhooks. This makes it easy to stay updated on relevant opportunities in real-time.\nWhy I made this?:\nLinkedIn sucks, their email blasts are often spammy and filled with irrelevant listings. On top of that, if you’re relying solely on mainstream platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed, it’s nearly impossible to be first in line for a newly posted opportunity. It scrapes company job boards directly, ensuring you’re notified of opportunities the moment they go public.\nStill making improvements everyday but you can give it a try using Homebrew (macOs) or install via Cargo (windows, linux).

          "description": "I started this project because I believe MCP has the potential to transform how AI models interact with external resources, but the ecosystem is still very fragmented. There's no central place to discover and compare all the server implementations available, which makes adoption and experimentation harder for developers.\nI initially built the GitHub repo awesome-mcp-servers (https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers/), and it's been amazing to see the community contribute to it. Now, I'm taking it further with a directory that automates many tasks—introspecting servers to determine the tools, resources, and prompts they provide, inferring required configurations, and checking dependencies for vulnerabilities. These features are designed to make it easier for people to trust and use these servers in production environments.\nWhile an open-source protocol is fantastic for innovation, I also think we need a centralized channel for addressing critical issues like security vulnerabilities, dependency management, and user support. My hope is that this directory not only grows with help from contributions, but also becomes a trusted resource for anyone entering the MCP space. If you're working on MCP servers or are interested in the project, I'd love to hear your thoughts!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42443069\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hello HN!\nIn a recent \"Ask HN: What are you working on?\" thread, I mentioned I was working on OCRing a large book:\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41971614\nThe post generated some interest so I thought I would keep HN posted.\nThe book is Saint-Simon’s Memoirs -- an invaluable historical account of the French court under Louis XIV, full of wit, sharp observations, and of incredible literary value. I'm OCRing the edition of reference made between 1879-1930, that contains a lot of comments and footnotes: 45 volumes, ~27,000 pages.\nHere's a link to a blog post that describes the techniques used so far (the project is still ongoing):\nhttps://blog.medusis.com/38_Adventures+in+OCR.html\nBut you may also directly access the result here:\nhttps://divers.medusis.net/boislisle/pub\nThis web app (not optimized for mobile, sorry) solves a tricky problem of preloading images efficiently. In short: preloading the next image isn't enough, since browsers will repaint if an image is moved, or scaled. Or browsers won't paint at all if visibility is hidden or opacity is zero, and will paint only when those values change. On an average, slow machine, this takes visible time. But if an image is simply behind another element, it will be painted, and the removal of the covering element or changing the z-index will not trigger a repaint.\n(Preloading is important because it lets one review results fast; if one has to wait 150-200 ms between images it's simply discouraging).\nWould love to hear feedback; happy to answer any question!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42443022\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "We built a way to go from requirements to a fully working admin panel/internal tool -type application within minutes. As a user you provide the various entities and their relationship plus any reports or dashboard widgets and it will generate it for you.\nThe problem with existing no code tools is that you still need to spend a lot of time building after figuring out what is needed (a problem of its own). Being able to focus on what is needed means you can build faster than designing, dragging, dropping, configuring.\nWhat can you describe? Everything from tables, field types, relationships between tables and columns/fields, role-based access restrictions (RBAC), reports, dashboard metrics, bar/line/pie charts, lists.\nThis is made possible by fine-tuning Llama 3.1 to convert requirements into specs and code. Applications evolve over time and this means that the model has to be predictable between versions to ensure that the data/schema migrations can be generated cleanly, as well as provide any errors and warnings related to the requirements or data loss.\nFor non-developers this can be a huge time-saver since you don't have to use any additional developer resources. For developers it can be a great way to get 80+% of the way for complex apps (it's like super-scaffolding). Generated apps can be fully evaluated before purchase. A full git repo containing the back-end, front-end, migrations, etc. is the output of the entire process.\nCurrently the generated code base is TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next.js but the capability is there to generate different stacks because of the approach taken to not go directly to code when fine-tuning.\nBrought to you by the team at Red Axle (https://redaxle.com)\nCheck out the video at https://youtu.be/rPppwB4jPlQ for a smaller app.\nWe look forward to your thoughts. Does building apps this way make sense for the super savvy HN crowd?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42442879\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi HN! Agora is a search engine for e-commerce products. We've indexed 4 million products sold on 8,100 Shopify and WooCommerce stores and made them easy to purchase with a single cart transaction. Think of a decentralized Amazon.\nI originally launched Agora as a side project here on HN to find a pair of red shoes for my wife last Christmas. I quickly realized that some of the best products on the internet are sold by small online stores that struggle to get the same visibility as large retailers. I started Agora on a mission to solve this problem. If you sell the best pair of red shoes in the world, customers should be able to find it.\nWe recently built a merchant dashboard that helps Shopify and WooCommerce merchants sell more on our search engine. Agora Merchants connects to your existing e-commerce store without any painful setup required and helps you track your store's performance on Agora. We don't take a commission of sales, orders are routed to your existing point of sale system, and inventory is automatically uploaded and refreshed. We do this with a combination of crawlers and AI agents.\nSo how is this different than Amazon? Both Amazon and Agora give network effects to stores (i.e. if you're searching for red shoes from one store, you may also want to buy a red dress sold by a different store). The key difference with Agora is that you continue selling on your existing e-commerce store, without having to manage inventory and payouts on another platform. This creates a magical experience for our merchants that saves them hundreds of hours. We believe in a future where merchants can sell however they want, we just bring them more customers.\nI'd love your feedback!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42441895\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

Each step is an LLM prompt that you can chain together and execute. You can choose the type of a step: Text, JSON, Function Call, ReAct Agent, Vector DB etc.\n2. Deploy it as a web application or JSON API\n3. All free for now. Will implement usage based charging later\nFeedback is welcome.\nIf you want to try it out, sign up here:\nhttps://app.acris.ai\nHow to use\nhttps://x.com/siraj_hs/status/1868986296372543912\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42441082\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

This allows for easy and permanent local storage, searchability, and integration with note-taking applications like Obsidian (which I use). If you sync again after continuing conversations, ChatKeeper will find your conversation files — even if you've moved or renamed them — and update them in place, so you can reorganize them to your heart's content.\nMany of my conversations have some lasting value, e.g. for reference or as part of a larger project.

I built Savvy so you can capture and share your CLI solutions in seconds.\nWith a simple savvy record history command, you can:\n   - Go back in time and cherry pick commands from your shell history\n   - Automatically expand aliases\n   - Redact sensitive information locally\n   - Convert hard-coded values into runtime placeholders\n   - Export locally to markdown files or create shareable team workflows using Savvy.\n\nSome FAQs\nQ) How Does Savvy’s CLI work?\n   Savvy’s CLI uses shell hooks (full support for bash and zsh.

The pipeline sends open access papers to an LLM asks the LLM to extract areas relevant to science in a form suitable for a geocoder, then we use a geocoder to get lat lons. When things happen in the same spot we jitter the locations a bit to differentiate things. gpt4o-mini was used for most of the analysis. Some of the features on the website are directly invented by Claude. There are some errors when geocoding went wrong or locations were extracted incorrectly.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42436556\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I'm exited to share this project I've been working on with you. Simply, it makes productivity and studying instantly rewarding and engaging from the start, increasing the chance of consistency in the long term.\nYou can start \"training sessions\" which are the timers where you are meant to focused. During this, if you are studying you can take AI generated quizzes based on certain subjects. Right now its a dropdown selection of set topics as I'm not sure of the safety of allowing people to type whatever they want to the AI, but I might change that.\nAfter the training sessions, based on the time trained and the team you have built, you receive points. These points can be used to build up your team by opening packs of various rarities. With this, you feel rewarded from getting points and being productive instantly. Along with this, you can join 'leagues' which are rooms with other people to compete to be the best. Also, you can compete in real time matches against others to make your team have more worth than show.\nIts publicly released but I'm still improving it daily and all I would like is for people to use it and give feedback, good or bad. Thank you!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42436497\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I got approached by the finance department of a large company. There is a new regulation in Europe that mandates a defined XML-format for e-invoices for some transactions and - I kid you not - their SAP implementation wasn't able to address this. They also said that all solutions on the market were either cumbersome (think: manually typing in all fields) or required deep system integration.\nI thought it cannot be that hard to use AI for this and built a little invoice converter that takes your PDF invoice in whatever form it is, and outputs exactly the XML structure that is required in the regulation. Given that AI is not perfect (but surprisingly close to it!), you can manually edit all fields.\nTarget users are companies where their current solution does not yet support the standard and that do not want to change their existing invoicing flow (incl. foreign businesses).\nTrying it out is free. Given this is my first real B2B tool, would love some feedback!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42435870\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

While the questions mostly remain the same, the answers can change and may correspond to different versions, forming a roadmap for future product success. A phenotype is the visualization of an answer, evolving as the answers change over time.\nCarton provides a framework for product scoping (not project management or product design) that makes use of this definition.\nLet's think even further. With the advent of artificial intelligence, the entire process of software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Soon, software will be created more through natural conversation than traditional programming languages.\nCarton helps ensure you always have a clear record of what you've asked from the AI and, even better, helps to request what comes next.\nIts a very early proof of concept phase.

          "description": "Hey guys,\nI wanted to show what we have been working on for the last few weeks. We have done data extraction/web scraping for the last few months, and we built this internally to help us. However, clients requested a SAAS tool, so here it is!\nYou guys can test it out here (app.potarix.com). Everyone who signs up gets 5$ credits. Scraping each page takes up $0.10 of your credits. You are not charged for unsuccessful scrapes!\nWe launched last week, and our platform was super buggy. We initially launched without the concept of \"jobs\" in our product, so every time you wanted to scrape a platform, you would have to wait 5 minutes on one screen to get your results. Something is bound to happen in those 5 minutes, so the task would fail for some unknown reason.\nLooking ahead, we built stuff in-house that we would love to include in the SAAS platform shortly. We have built functionality to click, type, scroll, etc. on the page. AI also tends to be wrong sometimes, so we created a tweakable script in the backend to control the agent's actions. That way, you are in control and can bring the script to 100% accuracy. We have also seen people battling to build infrastructure for their large-scale scraping projects. We wanna autonomously let folk set up parallelization and choose the infra for their project so everything is scraped as quickly and succinctly as possible from the SAAS.\nIf any of these future features sound interesting, feel free to book some time, and we can discuss how we can help you with these now!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42435480\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hey HN, I’ve been working on this multiplayer crossword for a while now. There’s still so much more on my todo list for it, but I think it’s time to launch and get some feedback with what I have.\nEvery hour, a new crossword (13×13 or 15×15) is generated at https://crosswordracing.com If you prefer smaller/faster, every ten minutes, a new mini crossword (7×7 or 11×11) is generated at https://crosswordracing.com/mini\nYou’re playing each crossword at the same time as everyone else, racing to complete it first. You can’t see what you’ve got right, until you correctly complete the entire grid. But you get some fun feedback on what other players are doing: a cell turns green if one other player has correctly solved it, orange if two other players have, and red if three or more other players have entered the correct letter in that cell.\nChat is emoji-only for the first half of the game (i.e. 30 minutes for the front-page, 5 minutes for the mini). After that, it unlocks and you can chat freely.\nIf you’re not done when the next crossword is generated, you can just stay on the current page for as long as you like and keep working to solve it.\nI didn’t manage to get user accounts done before my arbitrarily-imposed launch date, so everyone is anonymous for now. I definitely want to build accounts, streaks, trophies, etc. The other big thing I’m excited to build is a “team mode”. You should be able to play on a team, where you can chat freely with your team-mates, and the cell colors indicate what the other team has (collaboratively) got correct. I think that would be a lot of fun.\nThanks for reading, checking it out, and for any feedback. Feel free to ask me anything, of course.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42434157\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

You'll get notifications (email + app) when significant events matching your criteria are detected. For short-term projects, you'll be notified when your analysis is ready.\nBehind the scenes:\nWhen you give the AI Assistant a request to monitor an entity (like a stock or group of stocks), an AI Project Manager plans the project and breaks the project down into manageable tasks. These tasks run asynchronously - some recurring (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly), others one-time.\nExample prompts you can try:\nLong-term monitoring:\n- \"Monitor Apple stock and notify me of any important events and red flags\"\n- \"Monitor Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta stock. Notify me if any of them start trending toward being undervalued\"\nShort-term analysis:\n- \"Create a project to analyze the last 30 earnings calls for Tesla, spot trends, and how the business has evolved over time\"\nYou can track the progress of all tasks as the AI Agents work in the background.\nTry it here: https://decodeinvesting.com/chat\nThis is still an early version - we're actively improving it based on feedback. Would love to hear what you think and what features you'd want to see next!\nPreviously shared our AI-powered Stock Market Research Analyst: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41156478\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42433734\nPoints: 6\n# Comments: 4",

          "description": "Hey HN,\nWe’re excited to share PySpur, an open-source tool that provides a graph-based interface for building, debugging, and evaluating LLM workflows.\nWhy we built this:\nBefore this, we built several LLM-powered applications that collectively served thousands of users. The biggest challenge we faced was ensuring reliability: making sure the workflows were robust enough to handle edge cases and deliver consistent results.\nIn practice, achieving this reliability meant repeatedly:\n1. Breaking down complex goals into simpler steps: Composing prompts, tool calls, parsing steps, and branching logic.  \n2. Debugging failures: Identifying which part of the workflow broke and why.  \n3. Measuring performance: Assessing changes against real metrics to confirm actual improvement.\nWe tried some existing observability tools or agent frameworks and they fell short on at least one of these three dimensions. We wanted something that allowed us to iterate quickly and stay focused on improvement rather than wrestling with multiple disconnected tools or code scripts.\nWe eventually arrived at three principles upon which we built PySpur :\n1. Graph-based interface: We can lay out an LLM workflow as a node graph. A node can be an LLM call, a function call, a parsing step, or any logic component. The visual structure provides an instant overview, making complex workflows more intuitive.  \n2. Integrated debugging: When something fails, we can pinpoint the problematic node, tweak it, and re-run it on some test cases right in the UI.   \n3. Evaluate at the node level: We can assess how node changes affect performance downstream.\nWe hope it's useful for other LLM developers out there, enjoy!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42433689\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I’ve been on the job hunt for the past few months and after going through numerous reddit threads and Linkedin posts I saw that customized resumes make a huge difference in getting callbacks. But every tool I tried was either bloated with 50+ features I didn’t need or way too expensive (some were charging $70/month!). These people think I'm made of money!\nSo I decided to build my own AI resume builder.\nIt’s simple and streamlined:\nIt takes your resume and the job post and generates  a custom resume tailored to that post. (We do not store your resume or use it to train the AI)\nWhat used to take me 20-30 minutes now takes 30 seconds.\nI’ve gotten callbacks from companies like Apple, Nvidia, Meta, and Amazon using it.\nThe pricing is designed to be accessible: the more jobs you apply to, the cheaper it gets — around $2 per resume.\nI'd love for you to try it out and let me know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42433683\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",
