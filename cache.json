The main thing to notice was the score box—minimalist, clean, not too distracting. Sports broadcasts tend to clutter up the screen, and this was a nice change in my opinion. It did clash with the maximalist Super Bowl graphics, but I will be happy if that’s the route Fox is going with next season.\nI will admit that it is at least a little bit sad that I care about this. Time to make things even sadder: I have one massive complaint about the Super Bowl graphics package, and I want to share it with you here. A few times per game football broadcasts will throw to the announcers in the booth, where they will deliver analysis, convey game storylines, or just yuk it up a bit on camera. With the game itself being a blowout pretty much straight through, last night's broadcast went to Kevin Burkhardt and Tom Brady multiple times. They were shown not in the booth, but in front of a green screen. More to the point, Burkhardt and Brady were in front of a green screen depicting a completely empty alleyway that had apparently just been soaked by rain.",

          "description": "Kendrick Lamar capped off the greatest year a rapper has had in quite some time with a Super Bowl halftime show designed specifically to piss off Drake, his fans, and Fox News conservatives alike. A week after winning five Grammys for \"Not Like Us,\" it was pretty obvious that the smash hit was going to make an appearance, despite Drake's dogged attempts to sue damn near the entire music industry over the song. And Kendrick clearly had fun with that fact, repeatedly teasing the record at various points during the show until eventually performing it. At the song's telling moment, with a mischievous grin, Kendrick called out Drake right to camera before deftly declining to say the word \"pedophile\" on national TV.\n\"Not Like Us\" quickly transcended its original context within the beef, and has since become an anthem like The Killers' \"Mr. Brightside\" or The White Stripes' \"Seven Nation Army.\" It helps that its message is easily refashioned into a generalizable sentiment: THEY are not like US, whoever \"they\" or \"us\" might be. Kendrick himself has encouraged this broadening of the song's scope. \"Not like us is the energy of who I am, the type of man I represent,\" he said in an interview with SZA in Harper's Bazaar. \"This man has morals, he has values, he believes in something, he stands on something. He’s not pandering. If I’m thinking of 'Not Like Us,' I’m thinking of me and whoever identifies with that.\" Sure. Fine. But there is a context to it, and a fallout from it, and Kendrick brought it all up there with him on the Super Bowl stage.",

          "description": "Relying on Anthony Davis's availability is like setting foot on a rotted, rickety trapdoor and believing you'll be able to take another step. Beneath the trapdoor, in this analogy, is hell. Nico Harrison and Mavericks owner Patrick Dumont arranged it this way: By making it about a championship window, by calling their popular world-beating superstar an unreliable toxic fatso on his way out, by shrinking the period of observation down to the near term, the Mavericks all but announced This has to work right away. It became a piece of basketball wisdom so cheap and obvious that bothering to articulate it aloud had the ironic effect of making the speaker look somehow less knowledgeable about the sport: All of whatever they imagine makes Davis more valuable than Doncic to the present-day Mavericks relies upon Davis being upright. Davis does lots of things, many of them great and wonderful, but one of the things he does a lot is get hurt. And after not even three quarters of basketball in a Mavericks uniform, Davis got hurt.\nHe was playing very well Saturday, dominating the Houston Rockets and helping the Mavs to a 17-point halftime lead. Davis's skill and versatility popped immediately. He opened the game with a post touch against a positional mismatch, pulled in a help defender, scanned the court, and threw a perfect lob pass to Daniel Gafford for an alley-oop. Seconds later he swatted a layup from Alperen Sengun, gathered the rebound, led the break, and dished ahead to P.J. Washington for a transition dunk. Minutes later Davis dribbled the ball into the front court, sized up another mismatch, backed his defender into the paint, and turned over his shoulder for a calm jump hook. By halftime, Davis had 24 points, 13 rebounds, five assists, and three blocks, and the Mavericks had won his 21 minutes by a convincing 17 points. Harrison, who'd relinquished his seats in the arena due to the intensity of fan backlash, was for sure hearing the swelling music, if not the actual sounds of the game.",

Harold Carmichael, who would become a Hall of Famer, went in motion before the snap. He’d left too early. The play was called back, the Eagles punted, and three plays later Oakland Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett hit Kenny King for an 80-yard score. The Eagles lost the Super Bowl, 27-10.\nThat was Super Bowl 15, which was played in 1981, in New Orleans. I thought about that play during the first quarter of the Eagles’ absurd 40-22 blowout over the Chiefs last night in Super Bowl 59. I’d been thinking a lot about Super Bowl 15, the Eagles’ first and only previous New Orleans Super Bowl appearance. Never mind that it happened before I was born; oldheads in my neighborhood who had attended the game filled me in during my childhood. They talked about that Eagles Super Bowl trip as if they’d made a medieval pilgrimage to the Abbey of Saint Gall (patron saint of birds). They also complained about the penalty, still, a decade-plus after the fact. It was bullshit, they’d say, not pausing to apologize for the word. They believed that the Eagles could’ve won if they’d just been able to tie the game at 7 there.",

Jalen Hurts, the most serious person who has ever lived, finally getting the recognition he deserves as a fully-rounded quarterback. Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio ruining Patrick Mahomes’s shit without having to call a single blitz. Kansas City’s atrocious pass protection finally catching up with them, same as in 2020. GOAT coronations withheld. Cooper DeJean’s pick-six. Saquon. The power of Italian thinking. Whatever take greases your pole, you can have at it.\nSo here’s mine: the Eagles won this title because they draft out of their fucking minds.",

Pressured on 38 percent of his snaps, Mahomes was hit 11 times, sacked six times, forced into a pair of picks, and fumbled the ball away once. In one of the more stunning stats in NFL history, the Eagles did all that without blitzing a single time. That trickles down—because they never had to send help, Philadelphia was able to stay in Cover 4 all game long, cutting off deep balls and quickly smothering anything underneath. \"In order to make a team blitz, you have to be able to beat what they're showing.\" Mahomes said.\" And that's what we didn't do.\" \nPatrick Smith/Getty Images",

          "description": "The Kansas City Chiefs did the sensible, defensive, and very orthodox thing when they won the opening coin flip of Super Bowl 59—they deferred possession until the second half. It was the last thing they controlled the entire evening.\nThe team that rope-a-doped their way to almost incandescent glory in 2024 instead found out that, sometimes, you just can't slip the punch. It wasn't the third-time's-not-the-charm jinx that did them in, it was the Philadelphia Eagles. And more decisively, it was the Eagles with only some Saquon Barkley, an entirely different M.O. That meant the Chiefs weren't undone by a single player but a smothering collective impervious to even Patrick Mahomes's multileveled sorceries. The final score of 40-22 grossly flattered the Chiefs and barely explained Philadelphia's dominance. It's as if the \"GAME OVER\" legend at the end of Kendrick Lamar's halftime show had been frantically cobbled together after Zack Baun's second quarter interception.",

He would have bunny-hopped across an eight-lane highway for Bucks 135, Sixers 127 because for him—the last true basketball lifer—it wasn't the 135 or the 127 that moved him. It was the Bucks and Sixers part, and it would have been the same had he been given Pistons 112, Hornets 102, or Rockets 94, Raptors 87, or even anything involving the freshly re-deadified Wizards. Hubie was there unapologetically for The Game before him and only The Game before him. If you would have preferred Rockets-Raptors because it featured 81 points of better defense, you would have been wrong because every games was equal in his eyes— a chance to explain what was before him to people wanting to learn.\nHubie Brown is 91, and he looked and sounded every day of it 20 years ago when his coaching career ended. He coached somewhere for 30-some-odd years (even Wikipedia doesn't have firm dates for two of his high school jobs) and broadcasted somewhere for 29. He coached forever the same way, and he told the stories of the game the same way. He knew what he believed to be important, and walked and talked with that central precept for the entirety of his public life. He did it for so long and so unabashedly his way that he managed, somehow, to never fall out of fashion while anyone who came after him trying it Hubie's way was out of fashion immediately. The closest anyone came to doing Hubie was the much younger but no less self-assured JJ Redick, and he got in two years and change before he was hired to Hubie-up the Los Angeles Lakers.",

And if you can't be weird in Louisiana, well, what exactly is the point?\nWhen your biggest moment of the week, after all, is Roger Goodell leaning hard into an 18th game, you have a serious cultural dud on your hands. The football will be the football, of course, and as matchups go Eagles-Chiefs is not far from the best you can do. But New Orleans might be the last bastion of the pre-corporate days when the town created the atmosphere and it was up to the visitors to keep up. This time, the weirdest thing we got will be something we have to conjure in our own minds—the big game with a sitting President (Uncle Dismal) and a potential rival in 2028 (Stephen A. Smith). Neither is qualified to do the job, as one has proven and the other certainly would if given the chance, but the moment Smith's name appeared on a poll listing potential Democratic candidates and garnering 2 percent, we took an irrevocable turn toward a world in which Prince Andrew seems leaderly. All that is left for the rest of us is to find a country without an extradition treaty out of the way of the nuclear winds.",

In front of a season-record crowd at home, the No. 19 Lady Vols took down the No. 5 Huskies, 80-76, to end an 18-year rivalry drought.\nTo be fair, that timespan does include a 13-year gap in the series, which the late Pat Summitt called off in 2007 at the height of her feud with UConn head coach Geno Auriemma. He looks back on that heyday with little fondness. “It just became stupid and became something I didn't want to be a part of anymore,” Auriemma told reporters before Thursday’s game. “I think our fans are stupid. I think their fans are stupid, and how they reacted to the whole thing, it just became something other than a basketball game, and after a while that just got old.” (If he’s referring to the rivalry’s hostility, it should be noted that he had some hand in it, too.)",

Perhaps as media literacy declines and as social media's utility as a news scraper craters, the public's thirst for knowledge—at least about one specific thing: what time the Super Bowl starts—can only be quenched by conducting a Google search.

The two participating teams were among the least active at the deadline. The Timberwolves, sitting sixth in the Western Conference standings with one of the most expensive active rosters in the NBA, were severely restricted by the current CBA and made zero moves. The visiting Houston Rockets kept their roster intact but acquired 32-year-old Cody Zeller to fill the very last seat on their bench, and otherwise picked up a few future second-round draft picks.

With the team in fourth place in the division, the Philadelphia-based video rental chain pitched Eagles players on an idea—a rap song performed by the team, similar to the Chicago Bears' “Super Bowl Shuffle” three years earlier. Those Bears won the Super Bowl, and the song was nominated for an R&B Grammy, so it inspired a lot of imitators. Most were similar group raps by the team, but things did get weird around the margins.

In another gesture called knuckle knock, males knock repeatedly on the trunk of a small tree; knuckle knock is an invitation meant to attract female chimpanzees, who may respond to the knocking gesture with a sexual display.\nScientists have observed the four populations of chimps in the Taï forest—the North, Northeast, East, and South groups—since the 1970s, learning about each of their particular customs. Knuckle knock was a staple in the North group for generations; before 2004, every male in the group used knuckle knock to woo females. But in the ensuing eight years, the population never had more than one adult male. This eliminated the need for a male to distinguish himself among competitors, and also prevented any younger male chimps from seeing the gesture in use and learning it for the future. In 2008, the last adult male chimp in the North group, and perhaps the last of his population to use knuckle knock, was killed by a poacher.",
