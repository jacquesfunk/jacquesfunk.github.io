          "description": "The base, corrupting, disenchanting influence of money has allegedly been right on the cusp of ruining everything good, noble, and just plain fun about soccer for almost a century and a half now. An easy year to point to here would be 1885, when England FA's settled the roaring debate about amateurism by allowing soccer players to be paid to play. So much of the game's history since then—the development of the great clubs, the existence of the great leagues and tournaments, the emergence and movement of the great players—has been determined first and foremost by the pursuit of the almighty dollar. Rather than a point of departure, the current, baldly avaricious version of the Club World Cup is but the latest instantiation of trends that have dominated soccer for forever.\nClearly, soccer has not yet been ruined. In spite of everything—the widening gap between teams at the tippity top and those below, clubs getting coopted as money- and reputation-laundering fronts, the steady distancing between clubs and their local fan bases, globalization's concentration of talent and homogenization of the once richly diverse panoply of styles and strategies, overloaded schedules and overburdened players—the game still produces amazing games, amazing players, and amazing competitions, thrilling its enormous, rapt audience with incredible stories. It's not that the money-mindedness has actually been a good thing, nor that all those who've complained about it since 1885 were necessarily wrong. Rather, it's that even in inauspicious conditions, after decisions that seem to fly directly in the face of what has made soccer what it is, the game itself and the people who care about it usually endure.",

          "description": "In January 2024, Semafor media reporter Max Tani published a small scoop: Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman and writer Buzz Bissinger (most famous for authoring Friday Night Lights) were working together on Fetterman’s memoir, which was to be titled Unfettered and focus on his “political rise and struggles with mental health.”\nMuch has changed since then. Fetterman’s warmongering—he just proudly endorsed President Trump’s psychotic decision to bomb Iran—is one of many reasons his popularity has nosedived among Democratic voters over the last year-and-a-half. He's isolated himself from fellow senators and hemorrhaged staffers, many of whom have departed from his office and then spoken to the press, both on the record and anonymously, about his reportedly erratic behavior and his obsession with supporting Israel’s genocide against the people of Gaza. A New York magazine investigation published in May assigned a much darker definition of “unfettered”: a senator who cannot be reasoned with, who suffers from an addiction to social media, who texts and Facetimes while driving, and is plainly unfit for office.",

          "description": "I was convinced it was happening again. \nWith 7:41 left in Sunday night's NBA Finals Game 7, the Oklahoma City Thunder took a 22-point lead, a lead that would have felt insurmountable against any other team in the league. But there is no other team in the league like the Indiana Pacers, and they took control, pressuring the inbounds pass, springing double- and triple-teams at ball-handlers, and letting Bennedict Mathurin bash his way into the lane. OKC wobbled and the lead tumbled to 12 in three short minutes. The Thunder, playing prevent offense, did not make another basket for the remainder of the game. The pressure forced Shai Gilgeous-Alexander into committing his fifth foul, and Alex Caruso into calling the team's final timeout with over four minutes left. You could feel the arena hold its collective breath. How fitting it would have been, for a postseason defined more by the Pacers doing the impossible than by anything else, for them to win Game 7 on the road by turning on the blender.",

A rational world in which killing civilians for amusement is not an acceptable instrument of foreign policy, as just one farfetched example. But for sports fans, \"deserve\" is one of those verbs that works way too hard for its weight class, an advert for entitlement based on the notion that the next thing you see must by definition be more spectacular than the last thing you saw. Five-year-olds spit on your shoes in revulsion.\nBecause, and this will surely surprise all of you who have ever used the phrase \"in my lifetime\" as a useful metric for any athletic achievement, \"deserve\" isn't a word that means anything around here. You get what you get, the way you get it, and there's no refund for dissatisfaction unless you decide to get off your collective hinder and stop watching, attending, and paying. Until that moment, well, the polite way to put it is \"You bought it, so eat it. And on your way out, settle up your bill.\"",

Indiana's deficit was, at that moment, 14 points, and the clock showed 5:38. The Oklahoma City home crowd was chanting \"O-K-C\" at ear-splitting decibels, but the mood was not yet celebratory.

          "description": "A week before I was hired at Defector, I decided to quit vaping. This was kind of a while ago now, but I still have good days and bad. Today is a good day; I haven't even needed a patch today. Yesterday was a rough one. On rough days, I will go buy one single shitty poverty cigar—the brainchild of the Phillies' owner's dad, the Black & Mild wood tip. This is a multi-pronged strategy: I love wood tips, but I rarely smoke a whole one in a sitting, no matter how hard up I might be. Also, everyone around you will think less of you if you do this. A key feature of cravings is self-loathing, and it sort of feels deserved that people will see me: a questionably dressed yet ostensibly grown woman smoking a cigar that is usually purchased with coins. Weakness ought to feel like weakness.\nLast night, I had already smoked through my cigar of the day. Since my trip to New York, I'm staying with my aunt and uncle in La Crosse, Wis. for a little while before I drive the rest of the way back from to Tacoma. As the evening pushed forward, I was putting on an impressively brave face for them. Across the river in Winona, a thunderstorm had rolled in, lighting up the sky brilliantly, and the air was so thick you had a real sense for what was clapping back together when the lightning left its jagged vacuums. My aunt and uncle are big nerds (complimentary) about weather. They have a little plane and are spending their retirement bouncing around America with only Mother Nature to play defense. I'm a curious sort, so I leaned into that, hanging on every word they spoke. I begged them to explain more about how the wind played tricks on a small aircraft. I was desperate for distraction from the withdrawal. But after a while they got tired and turned in for the night. I couldn't take my car to satisfy my craving, because that would involve noisily opening the garage, which would be an embarrassing reveal of me making a whole trip to collect a second John Middleton product in just one Thursday. So I would go on foot.",

          "description": "For the first time in American sports history, a team has been sold on an 11-figure valuation. News broke Wednesday that the Buss family has agreed to sell a controlling share of Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter of TWG Global and Guggenheim Partners in a deal valuing the franchise at $10 billion. That is the largest-ever valuation at sale for a North American sports franchise, smashing the high-water mark recently set by the private equity guy who agreed to buy the Boston Celtics for $6.1 billion. Walter taking over and doing so at such a steep price is obviously interesting, though the bigger story is the Buss family finally cashing out, as they were the flag-bearers for a type of sports owner that is quickly being bought out of the business.\nJerry Buss bought the Lakers, the NHL's Kings, and the Los Angeles Forum in 1979 for $67.5 million. At the time, that sale price was a record high for a team, and though sports teams are the sort of asset that always appreciate in value, few would have predicted that the valuation of the team would increase by 15,000 percent over the following 46 years. In that time period, the collective identity of NBA ownership steadily changed. The used car dealer who owned the Utah Jazz sold the team, through his widow, to a tech billionaire. The NBA forced racist slumlord Donald Sterling to sell the Los Angeles Clippers to one of the richest men in the country. The Maloof brothers, inheritors of beer distribution riches, ran out of money and sold the Sacramento Kings to another much richer tech guy. Most of the people who own teams now are billionaires, and 20 percent of the league is now owned by people who made their billions in private equity.",

This dream confluence would give me a chance to watch reigning Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal, always a delight, and my first in-person look at Pirates ace Paul Skenes. Skenes had pitched in Detroit last year—also in the second game of a doubleheader that began with a Skubal start—but I’d missed it because I was in New York at company meetings for my (dumb) job and only caught a few minutes when Jasper gave us breaks from looking at his impressive charts.\nSome fans complained that the two aces would not start in the same game on Thursday, though as someone with plans to attend both, this didn’t especially bother me. What did annoy me was it being a split doubleheader: I’d have to buy separate tickets, and leave and come back. A small price to pay, I reasoned, for what was sure to be the greatest day of my baseball-watching life. Around 12:30, the Tigers announced that the 1:10 first game would begin in a rain delay. A slightly larger but still small price to pay, I reasoned, for what was sure to be the greatest day of my baseball-watching life.

Each day seems to bring some new horror or tragedy, and if the non-stop procession of bad news itself doesn't desensitize you, there's all those hucksters out there trying to sell you the idea that, actually, your empathy is wrong. It's enough to make you want to check out of everything altogether.\nAnd plenty of people have. One of the worst byproducts of Trump's second electoral victory was a refrain I heard a lot, usually from other black people: this concept of \"resting.\" The idea starts with the fact that, going back at least to the civil rights movement, black people have spent so much time fighting for our humanity and our communal betterment, only to watch the white-supremacist power structure repeatedly thwart any possibility of radical, positive change. And so, if white people and those who hope to sidle up to white supremacy are so determined to hold onto power, even if it means destroying themselves in the process, then we should let them. Our time now is the time to disengage from the political carousal and do what was best for ourselves. Black self-care as a political ideology unto itself.",

Even excluding the incidents in the previous three-game series the two teams played earlier this month, that's a lot of hit by pitches! Enough, in fact, to rank.\nWe are innovating in philosophical space here, raising and answering questions such as, Is it possible for a hit-by-pitch to be better quality than another hit by pitch?, and, If so, what makes a hit-by-pitch good? A hit-by-pitch is most meaningful if it is intentional, because otherwise that's just poor control, and poor control is ass to watch. Though intentionality is difficult to presume, pitches with more movement and pitchers with poor control are naturally discounted. A hit-by-pitch is also most meaningful if it carries more risk of hurting your own team—say, hitting a player who doesn't usually get on base, doing it in a close game or on an advantageous count, or doing it with hitters already on base. That is, the best hit-by-pitches are fueled by enough petty spite that they break out of the constrictive traditional frameworks of \"trying to win a baseball game.\"",

It's exhausting. It's unlivable. And it is here.\nStarting Friday, a giant hair dryer will be pointed at most of the United States. More than 200 million people are expected to be trapped under a terrible bubble of heat. The Weather Prediction Center is calling this a \"significant and extremely dangerous heat wave.\" And because for most of the Midwest, Great Lakes, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic this spring has been mild and wet, the quick shift to swamp will feel even more brutal. Temperatures will be hot as hell. Humidity will be high enough to curl straight hair. Don't even get me started on the dew point (disgusting). The nights will be muggy and miserable. There will be no wind. It is going to be painful.",

I stumbled into this paradigm in March of 2023, when Nora was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at the age of 2. Nora is 4 now—a fiery, intelligent young lady who leads her classmates in preschool group activities and directs mommy to the car whenever they are lost in the parking lot—but she still doesn’t speak. On a short enough timeline, that’s perfectly fine; we don’t need to speak to enjoy an hour at the park or share an ice cream cone. Nora is happy. She is healthy. Everything is all right.\nStill, being a parent is a worrying thing, and there are fears that never really go away. What if she never speaks? What if she can’t take care of herself after my wife and I are gone? Lately, this fear has assumed a distressingly hued human form, one frequently seen getting upset in front of Congress and making rounds on the cable news circuit. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will talk to, or at, anyone; like many of the content creators Donald Trump has appointed in his second term, he seems to understand that to be his job. But when it comes to autism, it feels as if he is speaking directly to me.",

Before last Saturday's game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants at Dodger Stadium, the singer Nezza performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" in Spanish, even after being told not to by team representatives, in a symbolic protest against the jackbooted deportation raids being carried out around the country and in Los Angeles by faceless federal goons. It is the sort of cruelty that no human being can help but take sides on, but a baseball team is not a human being, and the Dodgers had pointedly declined to offer any comment on the crisis to that point, even as Angelenos' protests in the streets were repeatedly escalated to violence by heavy-handed policing.\n\"We're not going to comment,\" Dodgers executive vice president and chief marketing officer Lon Rosen said that same day. That was in response to questions from the Los Angeles Times about whether the team had anything to say to its fans, a community that the organization proudly boasts is 40 percent Latino, and therefore a disproportionate target of ICE raids. \"We’re not going to comment on anything.\"",

The 20-point lead, once the gold standard, is now 30, and even then there's a little white-knuckling to be done. But like any absolute counterfactual, sometimes the percentages get in the way. In fact, in every case of a team getting a 30-point lead, it was once a 20-point lead. Sometimes an ass-kicking is just an ass-kicking.\nEnter Game 7 of the NBA Finals, coming Sunday night to a television near you. The Pacers, who have gained their ultra-plucky reputation as the team that lets the other guy get the 20-point lead before eradicating it, finally went nearly wire-to-wire (minus the first three-and-a-half minutes) in a 108–91 beatdown of the Thunder to force El Juego Definitivo.",

As of June 6, the labor department has reported the federal government has gotten rid of 59,000 jobs since January. These firings are deeply political.

This is in spite of mitigating factors such as facing the \"Los Angeles\" Angels of Anaheim and being newly Giancarlo Stanton'd up. Take a 2–0 loss to the Boston Red Sox, a 1–0 loss in 11 innings in the ghost runner era, and a 4–0 loss to Kyle Hendricks's 86 mile-per-hour fastball, et voilà: The Yankees are now the third team this year to achieve this storied feat, joining the Cincinnati Reds and the Colorado Rockies. That's company you want to be keeping.\nUnlike the Reds and the Rockies, who accomplished the feat through the tried and true strategy of not getting on base, the Yankees have gone the much more convoluted route of getting runners on base and stranding them there. They have left as many runners on base as the Reds and Rockies had combined during their respective streaks. In their 11-inning shutout loss, the Yankees had the bases loaded and Hunter Strickland on the mound. Anthony Volpe grounded out to end the game. A classic mishap of putting in more effort to get the exact same results: zero runs, zero wins. In some ways, you have to respect it.",

The vibe around the program could not possibly be worse, and enthusiasm levels could not possibly be lower.\nSome of this funk can be explained by the U.S. team getting embarrassed on the field. Until they hung five goals on poor Trinidad and Tobago over the weekend, the USMNT had lost four straight games by an aggregate score of 9-2. Two of those were competitive games against CONCACAF rivals and two were friendly losses to legit European teams, though there's little point in drawing a distinction between the pairs of matches, because the stakes in both were the same: nothing.

That's hardly even worth saying, but it's also not really what Roose is saying.\nWhat Roose wants is to put an entire suite of claims about the technology presently doing business as \"artificial intelligence\"—not just that it has more than zero uses (a thing nobody really denies) but that it truly is artificial intelligence or anything like it; that it represents a profound leap forward for technology and human endeavor; that it is the future; that, as such, adopting it and integrating it into day-to-day work and life processes is the smart move—beyond dispute. He wants to marginalize the many technology experts, media knowers, and sharp lay readers who have for years been calling his work on behalf of those claims appalling boobery. He wants his readers to view all of those critics as coterminous with whatever minor body of irrelevant five-follower internet loons might bother trying to argue the literal uselessness of a predictive text generator or a program that collates search engine results into layperson's language. He wants his readers to think of all the critics as united in an essentially pathological relationship with the observable world. And he wants the juice of dancing this shitty little passive-aggressive jig on Bluesky, the social-media platform where many of those critics will encounter his work and, while dunking on it, also share it around to some number of people who will read it.",

The fundamental instability of fascist political formations is one of those.

It is all jarring and idiotic and miserable, and as it fails around you there really isn't much comfort in the knowledge that it Actually Doesn't Work. In the long run, it absolutely doesn't, but the people in charge do not believe in the long run; the work of their project is to freeze the present in place, and to defy whatever reckoning tomorrow might bring. Everyone else is trapped in that unending day with them, a place where bad things are always happening but nothing ever resolves.

They ignore the part, or take shortcuts around it because it's difficult to achieve, where Florida's toughness is merely a flavor of its skill. The Panthers are good. They score goals and they wear down defenses and generally make life difficult for opposing skaters because they finish their checks and protect their guys and drive you slobberingly insane with rage because they know where the line is, and play comfortably just on either side of it. \nYour favorite team, in search of toughness to help get over a playoff hump, will do things like—say—sign Ryan Reaves for three years. The Panthers, on the other hand, will do things like trade for Matthew Tkachuk and let him define their whole identity, or acquire Sam Bennett for a song and watch him win the Conn Smythe, or get Brad Marchand (poster boy for \"good enough that he doesn't need to do the extracurriculars, but better for having them in his bag\") at the deadline.",

          "description": "The Club World Cup kicked off over the weekend in the United States, and it's been a wild ride so far, in the most derogatory way possible. It's not so much about the games themselves, which have been mostly either stodgy goalless draws or one-sided beat-downs (thanks for coming, Auckland City, enjoy your 10-0 defeat to Bayern Munich!) in front of small, generally disinterested crowds (who could've imagined that a Monday afternoon match between Chelsea and LAFC in Atlanta wouldn't exactly pack the stadium?). Instead, the real action for this rebranded and expanded version of the tournament has come off the pitch, as the tournament kicks off amidst nationwide protests and Donald Trump's quest to be the most special dictator he can be. Luckily for Trump, he has FIFA bending the knee left and right.\nThe concept of the Club World Cup itself may be exciting on paper—never-before-seen matchups! true global representation! concrete proof that MLS does indeed suck!—but all of its ostensibly commendable aims are undermined by the core truth that this tournament exists solely to make FIFA lots of money, player welfare, fan interest, and competitive integrity be damned. That core truth is why the newfangled tournament never seemed all that compelling for those of us who don't stand to make millions from either producing or participating in it; the Trumpy specifics of this particular edition—all the reports about ICE and Customs and Border Protection showing up to games, as well as requests that everyone attending bring proof of citizenship, residency, or their visas—soured an already sour proposition.",

In fact, they have already done it even though the Shiny New Toy In Question hasn't even been unwrapped yet, let alone aligned.\nIn moving four certified mammals to the Boston Red Sox for designated hitter and apparent pain in the ass Rafael Devers, the Giants finally achieved the big get they hadn't managed since they outbid themselves by $40 million for Barry Zito in 2006. That one was an analytic misstep, unless you count Zito’s two postseason starts in 2012, in which he won Game 5 of the NL Championship Series (with the Giants down 3-1 to the St. Louis Cardinals) and then Game 1 of the World Series.

We are not yet at that point in the season. The Ohtani coverage will continue until the pitch count improves. It speaks to the absurd density of what has changed about Shohei Ohtani that this is the situation of his first start in nearly two years: He threw his first 28 pitches in a Dodgers uniform on the same day that his former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, reported to federal prison.\nI would like to hype up the outing with more than that. Ohtani's return to the mound is not a novelty, as some might have feared after he left the Los Angeles Angels—for any criticism allotted to the Angels, you have to admit that they were in a position to let Ohtani do whatever he wanted. As previously noted, the Dodgers desperately need starting pitching. And so they had to take the option of a glorified rehab start, considering the minor league dilemma: As pitcher Ohtani and hitter Ohtani are the same person (allegedly; I have only seen one of him at any given time), his rehab start necessarily had to take place against the San Diego Padres as opposed to, say, the Round Rock Express. It was arguably overshadowed by Dylan Cease hitting Andy Pages with a fastball, and Padres manager Mike Shildt shouting, \"Who the fuck do you think you are?\" after Pages expressed some displeasure at taking 98 miles-per-hour to the arm. In otherwise, average Dodgers–Padres June game shenanigans.",

But I mean it in the most literal sense possible. Kris Knoblauch presumably knows by this point who it will be, but if anyone tells you they know who's the better option, they're lying. Nobody knows!\nWhile the Panthers have made it to within a game of clinching their second straight Cup on the back of Sergei Bobrovsky and only Sergei Bobrovsky, the Oilers got through the past two months with a chaotic combo in net. They began with their primary starter, Stuart Skinner. The 26-year-old looked like the answer to their crease problem when he first slotted into the role a couple of years ago, but has only declined from there. Skinner almost handed the team an early exit, looking absolutely helpless in his first couple games against the Kings. He was replaced by the 33-year-old Pickard, a fringe NHLer whose only season as a starter saw him lead the league in losses for Colorado in 2017. Inexplicably, Pickard won four straight for the Oilers to get the series win, and even though a couple of those games were 7-4 and 6-4, Edmonton was in no position to complain.",

As soon as she took the microphone, a few people on the back side of the little pavilion at the center of Mullinix Park began heckling her; at first, a whole crowd away and out of sight from the hecklers, I thought they were pro–Donald Trump counterprotesters, but I made my way over there and found that they were actually anti-Trump protesters, perhaps the anti-Trump-iest people there, and were mad specifically at the congressperson.\nWhen McClain Delaney spoke of the need to stand up to the Trump administration's terrorism of immigrant communities, one of the hecklers shouted \"Then don't thank ICE!\" This seemed like it was probably a reference to her vote in favor of a congressional resolution expressing \"gratitude to law enforcement officers, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel, for protecting the homeland.\" I didn't get a chance to ask any of them, but I'd wager they were also unhappy with McClain Delaney's vote for the Laken Riley Act calling on ICE to detain and deport immigrants arrested for—but not convicted of or even charged with—nonviolent offenses.

In Legally Blonde, that's Reese Witherspoon slipping her freshly painted toenails into wedge heels with a heart on them, before she heads out to the date that will ruin all her plans. In Pride & Prejudice (2005), that's Keira Knightley reading while she walks outside, and returning home to her chaotic family. In Materialists—the new Celine Song movie released over the weekend—Dakota Johnson applies lip gloss in a mirror and runs out onto the New York City streets, her high ponytail swinging. She passes a tall man, stops him, and offers him her card. She's a matchmaker named Lucy, and he's tall and rich and would be great for her clients.\nBut that's not the first scene in Materialists. The movie opens with a vast red-rocked canyon filling the screen. It is beautiful and immense. Then we watch a long-haired prehistoric man chop a bushel of daisies, put it into a backpack, and carry it to a cave where a woman waits for him. They do not speak. The man then twists the stem of one of the daisies into a ring and slips it onto the cave woman's left ring finger. Get it? It's not a diamond. It's just a flower. That's love, baby.",

The Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, host site of the Canadian Grand Prix, encircles an island in Montreal. It is a gorgeous circuit, featuring the close-hewn walls of a street race, a run through lush greenery rivaling even the aesthetics of the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, and marmots. Groundhogs, specifically, who have found a circuit raised upon their homes and stayed put, to infrequent risk of extreme bodily harm, i.e. decapitation or bisection.\nOn turn 13, Lewis Hamilton hit a groundhog that was on track with his Ferrari. The remainder of the groundhog stayed as debris on the track, shown a few times throughout the race. Hamilton was smartly not informed of this fact during the race, which, thanks to resulting floor damage and poor pit-stop timing, he spent largely treading water on an island in P6. The nature of automobiles leads to somewhat flippant and/or nervously hysterical reactions to loss of animal life—during the weekend's running of 24 Hours of Le Mans, the delirious night session commentators' processing of a local rabbit death included a (unobserved?) moment of silence and the term \"derabbitized\"—but the vegan Hamilton was naturally upset after the race. There may be a crude metaphor in there for how things are going at Ferrari this year, though it remains to be seen who exactly is the groundhog.",

          "description": "There is a defensible reading of Game 4 of the NBA Finals as an aesthetic disappointment, a slugfest of a game defined by Bennedict Mathurin missing a bunch of free throws in the final minute and the Oklahoma City Thunder shooting a collective 3-for-16 from three-point range and recording a collective 11 assists, both season lows. Certainly, if you wanted to read the game through the lens of individual offensive brilliance, you'd find the text lacking, though to do so would be to voluntarily step back from the bleeding edge of basketball. Game 4 was not only the best game of what has been a great series, but a klaxon from the future, the highest-level example of the sort of collective, pure-pressure hoops that's been the story of this season.\nThe ghastly 3-for-16 figure is an instructive place to start, as it is an extremely aberrant statistic. What it shows is not so much a Thunder offense that played poorly, but a Pacers defense that strung together a near-perfect night of defense. The most thoughtfully articulated concerns about the ubiquity of the three-pointer in modern NBA basketball arrive at the point that the three makes NBA offense fundamentally unstoppable, the spatial advantages of parking a bunch of guys on the perimeter rendering the game into a mere shooting contest. The defense played by both the Pacers and the Thunder makes a mockery of that assertion, as both units managed to shut down the opponents' long-range shooting without surrendering open looks at the rim.",

I am going to keep my index finger pressed to your lips until you finish hearing what I have to say: Yes, a bushel of first-round picks is the kind of thing you expect to see included in a trade package for a real-deal superstar, which Bane is not. But to call this an overpay by the Magic would be to ignore how deals actually get done in the NBA. Players of a certain status are able to heavily influence and in some cases entirely dictate their own movements in the trade market, meaning that if a team like Orlando wants to hoard a pile of first-round picks until a true franchise savior becomes available to them, they are likely to be sitting on those picks forever. You can only play in the corner of the market that's available to you, and Orlando found a big prize in theirs.",

But that was before the Knicks entered the playoffs and New York City exploded.\nSeemingly overnight, the city was covered in blue and orange. Suddenly, I couldn't go to the gym without someone uttering phrases that might as well have been code: pick-and-roll, bing bong, double overtime, Reggie Miller. If I'm being honest, it wasn't until the Knicks started their third playoff series against the Pacers that I finally understood that Game 5 is actually closer to Game 20 for these players. But by the time my older brother told me he was planning to come to New York if the Knicks won the whole thing, my curiosity had officially been piqued.",

          "description": "All across the United States and beyond on Saturday, millions of people got together and expressed—to put it in probably the most broadly acceptable terms to everyone who went—that Donald Trump needs to get out of everybody's business. Coming after days of anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles, as the community there fights to protect immigrants from kidnapping and torture, the \"No Kings\" demonstrations contrasted with a dull, dorky military parade Trump held for his own amusement on the same day in Washington D.C.\nProtesters in Los Angeles, specifically, faced yet more violence from police, who charged at a crowd on horseback, beat people with batons, fired projectiles, and used tear gas. In Minnesota, protesters gathered after that day's assassination of Democratic state Rep. Melissa Hortman and attempted killing of Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman by a person, still at large, who allegedly impersonated a police officer.",

          "description": "Brad Marchand. Again. As if the Florida Panthers taking a 3-2 series lead in front of a passionate Edmonton Oilers crowd wasn't brutal enough, it had to be the NHL's premier pest who orchestrated the 5-2 win in Game 5 on Saturday night. After scoring the team's last two goals in Game 2's OT win and following that up with the play that kicked off a blowout in Game 3, the 37-year-old trade deadline pickup from Boston scored Nos. 9 and 10 of his playoffs to help the Panthers to within one win of their second straight Stanley Cup. All Edmonton could do in response is curse him and pray for two straight victories.\nWith Game 4's exhilarating comeback win, the Oilers took back home-ice advantage in this series, and the fans flaunted it with a beautiful \"O Canada\" singalong before puck-drop. But what followed was pretty depressing from start to finish, and it began with Marchand's opening goal 10 minutes into the first, which came from pure hustle and speed. Watching a face-off after an out-of-play, Marchand pounced on what was technically a Draisaitl win before any other Oilers could get to the puck. He was so quick, and in such good position, that he instantly eliminated most of the opposing skaters from the play. Taking the puck right down the middle, he swerved around one defenseman and protected himself from the other, lasering a shot high on a Calvin Pickard that had gone low.",
