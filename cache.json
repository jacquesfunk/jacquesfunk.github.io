          "description": "For the first 20 or so minutes of The Picture Of Dorian Gray, the Broadway adaptation of the Oscar Wilde novel as a one-woman show starring Sarah Snook, the production asks a genuinely disturbing question: \"What if you were watching TV, instead?\" At the top of the hour, Snook enters the stage without fanfare, surrounded by crew members—really, they should be considered performers, too—who will spend the next two hours filming her with compact cameras. She takes a seat behind the gigantic vertical screen in the middle of the stage, looks into a lens, and speaks to the audience two-dimensionally.\nWhat follows is a by-heart reading of the start of the book—I'm pretty sure, at least, because I've never read it. Snook does the narration and the dialogue, and then the scope expands, but only sort of. Soon, Snook is costumed as Dorian—one of many characters she plays—and moves around the stage giving, basically, just that performance, as the young man poses for and then desperately admires a painting of himself. Filling out the show is prerecorded work: other Snook performances superimposed on screen or piped in as audio. In a dinner party sequence, for example, she performs live as Lord Henry while portraying the guests—all with their own elaborate costumes and ways of speaking—on the Broadway Jumbotron. In an adaptation of a story about vanity, the actress is playing with nobody but larger-than-life versions of herself.",

Largely this is because it ignores the performance of the winning team, and most of the time sports really are as simple as one team playing better than the other. So it is with the skeptic's eye (but still the hater's temptation) that I find myself loath to credit the Maple Leafs' ongoing collapse, from up 2-0 on the Panthers to down 3-2 after a 6-1 shellacking Wednesday night, to some sort of inherent Leafiness. Do I really believe that the tension is too much for successful pro athletes like Auston Matthews, still goalless in the series? Is the second round that much more stressful than the first, in which they seemed fine? Would the most competitive people on Earth really lay a Game 5 stinker because they just happened to not feel like giving full effort that day?\nThat is for Canadian sports media to discuss all summer, and they will, and it will get very stupid. But I do find my stony resolve cracking a bit when I see what the Leafs themselves had to say about a game in which they allowed six unanswered. \"We all need to be better, me included,\" head coach Craig Berube said.",

          "description": "Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo is real good at getting ejected from a baseball game. A fellow ought to get his dang money's worth; there are too many managers out there—sleepy, retiring types, or the constitutionally frail—who do not or cannot make a truly cinematic moment out of an argument. Fans and players alike appreciate a manager who kicks huge ass. At least one Washington National, for example, is reportedly chafing at the recent passivity of the team's cardiovascularly challenged head guy. Lovullo will not leave his men wanting: When he marches out there, odds are someone is going to take a reaming for the ages. \nAnd Lovullo, God bless him, doesn't need much of an invitation. Only seven active managers have been tossed more; Lovullo, in his ninth season as a manager, is already in the top-100 all-time, with 22 career ejections. By way of comparison, it took Hall-of-Famer Hughie Jennings 16 seasons to get to 24. Lovullo may not have Bobby Cox's prodigious, historic pace—a fantastic 162 career ejections in 30 seasons—but then this is a different era. As broken down in a 2019 New York Times story, the manager meltdown is considered somewhat déclassé in the modern game. \"I tell [today's umpires], 'You guys are lucky you weren’t around 20, 30 years ago,\" says Reds manager Terry Francona, who has been run just 51 times in 23-plus major-league seasons. Giving a volcanic helping of The Business to those antagonists in the blue shirts was, in earlier times, considered an important part of the job, not just to address umpire performance but to inspire one's own team out of mid-summer ennui.",

When the Valkyries play their season opener in San Francisco this Friday, Nakase will add to that list, becoming the first head coach of the franchise, and the first Asian-American head coach in WNBA history. She is a third-generation Japanese American from Southern California, raised by a basketball-loving father who kept his daughters in the gym the way some parents bring their children to church.\nBasketball has been an integral part of Japanese-American communities on the West Coast since the early 1900s. Shaped by forcible internment during World War II, Japanese-American basketball leagues (colloquially known as the “JA leagues”) flourished for decades as a way to cultivate second- and third-generation talent, and still operate to this day. The use of digital archives dating back to the 1940s, as well as interviews with relatives and members of the JA league community, can demonstrate how the story of Natalie Nakase is the story of Japanese-American basketball. Go through her family history, and you’ll find competition and resilience that transcends the sport itself.",

          "description": "After his Oklahoma City Thunder finished up a spectacular Game 5 win against the Denver Nuggets, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander fielded a question about the game's best player: Nikola Jokic. The reigning MVP put together a near-perfect game against the presumptive MVP's team, with 44 points on 25 shots, 15 rebounds, and five assists that could have been thrice as many if any single one of his teammates could have hit one single shot after halftime. \"It's a team sport,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"No one guy can do it.\" In what was comfortably the best game of the whole second round, and close to the best game of the 2025 NBA playoffs, one guy very nearly did it. That he could not answers some pretty important questions.\nJokic had not had a good series before Game 5. Apart from his Game 1 masterclass, Oklahoma City has been defending the hell out him, keeping Isaiah Hartenstein glued to his right shoulder while sending their ballhawking wings down to swipe at the ball and deny him the easiest pressure-release passes. He had 21 made field goals and 16 turnovers in the middle three games of this series, often looking flustered by all the pressure.",

But this year, when she saw decorations in the store, she paused in the aisle. \"Should I decorate some red, white, and blue for outside?\" Gibson remembered asking herself. \"And I'm just like, no. I'm really not feeling the miracle right now, and who's representing it.\" Because in February, after working for the federal government for 17 years, Gibson learned that she would lose her job as a contract specialist at the Office of Personnel Management, through no fault of her own.\nOPM, essentially the federal government's human resources agency, has historically flown under the radar of the general public. But this winter, Elon Musk and DOGE functionally took over the agency to carry out their campaign of mass firings. As CNN reported in March, OPM employees who previously sent communications to federal agencies watched from the sidelines as Musk's OPM sent a barrage of termination notices to federal employees. One such notice was the \"Fork in the Road\" email, which offered workers a chance to be paid through September if they left their posts—an attempt to downsize the federal workforce and remove anyone resistant to Trump's agenda.",

Then the Washington Post published a letter from Hudson resigning from her cheerleading gym, and the paper informed all of us that Hudson’s mother runs a “popular sex boutique” in Provincetown, Mass. Oh, and Hudson finished third in the Miss Maine USA pageant. A nation wept.\nNow that’s a lot of information to take in. I’m so wrapped up in the story of Jordon Hudson—our heroine used to give henna tattoos to customers in Provincetown while wearing her regional beauty pageant sash—that I nearly forgot about the football part of this story.

          "description": "This is our second blog this week about Javy Báez, because the Detroit center fielder (yes, center fielder!) has simply demanded it. There are players in MLB who can boast a higher WAR or more home runs, but nobody in baseball has surprised like Báez through his first 34 games. Once one of the sport's most exciting young talents with the Cubs, then an absolute washout who OPSed below .600 in back-to-back years, a humbled Báez returned from season-ending surgery last August to a growing team that had unexpectedly fashioned itself into a contender. But rather than be an awkward appendix on a roster that seemingly proved it was better off without him, Báez has pieced himself back together. Now, he's a leading hitter on—I swear this is real—Baseball Reference's World Series favorite. And Tuesday night's performance against the Red Sox was his most endearing yet in a Tigers uniform.\nWith some wet weather in Detroit and a Tarik Skubal start scheduled for the next day, it wasn't a big crowd that witnessed Javy's heroics live. But Michigan is following the Tigers more closely than it has in any spring for the past decade, and I could feel the reverberations from a thrilling 11th inning all the way out in Brooklyn, where I listened to Dan Dickerson on the radio call during my walk home. It was Javy who was responsible for extras in the first place, scoring from third on a botched pickoff from the Boston catcher early on and then clobbering a breaking ball to left for a three-run shot in the sixth.",

You know how it is.\nThey have been on the same team twice. The first time was in 2020. Before that, between 2013 and 2019, Marc Márquez cemented the end of the Valentino Rossi dynasty. He became the youngest major champion in motorcyclesport, and then won five more championships on the back of his remarkably aggressive style. In his obscene 2019 season, he had one retirement, and otherwise finished top-two in every single race of the year. He accomplished all this without much help from his machinery: The Honda was broadly considered far from the best bike on the grid at the time. Like a lot of greats, Marc Márquez is either loved or resented, though the latter is no knock on his public demeanor. He is noticeably smiley. The same wide, full-faced grin has stayed with him from then, into 2020, and onto now.",

I want to see it all, even if that means being guided by the hand.\nImagine my shock, then, over how I played Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the ridiculously named role-playing game by French studio Sandfall Interactive that became one of the best reviewed games of all time shortly after its release on April 24. I had not heard of Clair Obscur before the reviews and hype started rolling in, and I immediately bought and downloaded it. A turn-based RPG that is both gorgeous and almost hilariously French?

Forest maintained its over-performing underdog act for so long and so admirably this year, and it was just starting to look like the team might avoid the Icarian fate that usually befalls the (relatively) low-spending high fliers of any given Premier League season. Alas, with Sunday's 2-2 draw against Leicester City, it appears that the wax is running, the feathers are falling out, and Forest has entered what could be a tailspin.\nNo one could really say it's surprising that the Tricky Trees have fallen off the pace that had them soaring in the Champions League places. Over the course of 38 matches, it's hard for the talent of the big boys, the health of your overachievers, and the god of regression not to eventually catch up with even the most brave and resilient upstarts. In Forest's case, rivals like Man City, Newcastle United, and Chelsea have started to hit some better form entering the final stretch, key Reds like Callum Hudson-Odoi and Murillo have picked up untimely injuries, and Chris Wood, the big galoot who could not stop scoring goals (he has 20), has more or less stopped scoring goals (two in his last nine games). As such, the Trees have picked up just five points from their last six matches, which has seen them drop from a comfortable third place down to seventh.",

Nowadays being a fan of the Wizards means hoping they will lose—they trained me for this, by trying hard for six months to lose as much as possible—and I'll be damned if I can switch off that impulse in time for the draft lottery. Unto the Wizards I say: Ha ha! Screwed by fate, but not a cruel one: A just and righteous fate, a Rod Serling-ish fate rather than a Stephen King-ish one. Also screwed by the universe: the Utah Jazz and the Charlotte Hornets, fellow practitioners of the Vomit Arts. Owned to hell, all of you! Ha ha!\nStill this morning I would like to ram my head into one of those industrial rock smashers, because of who won the lottery. The son-of-a-gun Dallas Mavericks—those selfsame bozos who just torched their future, proudly and defiantly, for a foundation of two unreliable and rapidly eroding veteran stars—jumped an incredible 10 spots and won the top overall pick in the 2025 draft. Their odds of winning were less than two freakin' percent. A third of the damn league had better odds of landing that pick; a solid seven of those teams might even have been able to say they deserved a friendly turn from the cosmos.

          "description": "SAN FRANCISCO —The NBA playoffs have been going for nearly a month and everyone is suffering. Jayson Tatum awaits an MRI on a Monday night leg injury that may well have ended his playoffs and Boston's title repeat hopes; Damian Lillard's Bucks career ended with an Achilles tear; and Steph Curry is down with a strained hamstring. The headlining injuries hardly even tell the story. The eight teams still in contention look battered and out of gas: The Nuggets just scored eight points in a first quarter, the Celtics whimpered and died in two straight fourth quarters, and the ailing Cavaliers were just ground into a fine powder by the Pacers. Things are going to get worse, as we're not even halfway through the playoffs. It is hard to shake the feeling, especially after the Tatum injury, that the eventual champion will not necessarily be the best team but the least damaged. Which brings us to the word of the playoffs: physicality.\nThroughout this NBA postseason, players and coaches cannot stop talking about physicality, and the necessity of meeting it. \"I think the physicality was there,\" Magic coach Jamahl Moseley said after his team lost Game 2 against the Celtics. \"I don't think they were dirty plays, but I think it passed a line of physicality,\" Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said after his team lost Game 1 to the Pacers. \"Our physicality was great tonight,\" Jaylen Brown said after taking a 3-1 lead against the Magic. \"If you look around the playoffs right now, it’s super physical,\" Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said in the first round of his team's series against the Lakers. \"To me, they’ve gone way too far on the physicality. [...] It feels like it’s physicality without purpose.\" After his team lost Game 3 against the Clippers, Nuggets coach David Adelman provided the diagnosis: \"Defensively, we have to meet their physicality.\"",

Listening to them week after week, the message started to feel tired. How sincerely can you focus on the good things after you lose? When goalie Ann-Renée Desbiens got hurt, then Kati Tabin got served a multi-game suspension, it was hard to picture this as a team that could sustain their early-season dominance. In March and April, the Victoire lost as much as they won. Come playoffs, would they show up and win games, or would they bow out suddenly and gracelessly like last year? But it really was true that every single player talked about the team’s confidence, every game. What comes first: the belief or the act of professing it? For the Victoire, maybe it doesn’t matter.\nIn Game 1, Montreal suffered from a serious case of playoff nerves. Silly mistakes saw pucks slip through Ottawa’s crease unanswered, and Montreal never led. Both the Victoire’s goals came off of power plays—a good showing for their special teams—but they couldn’t figure out how to score without l’avantage numérique. Despite outshooting Ottawa, they did what they’d always done in the playoffs: lose.",

Javy hatred, I thought, was the sign of a dull mind. It linked everything I resented in my fellow Tigers fans: their sourness; their temper; their archaic obsession with “errors”; their belief in a baseball value system that didn’t resemble mine and could never account for the singularity of Javy. It bothered me when the complaints tipped into falsehoods, the insistence that Javy was “lazy,” that he’d gotten his bag in 2022 and then stopped trying.\nOf course, I was watching the games and seeing what everyone else saw. Báez's power numbers fell to such lows that the rare home runs he did hit were kind of funny. His on-base percentages had always skewed low—the cost of a free-swinging approach—but three seasons into the contract, they were dire. In 2024, he slashed .181/.221/.294. The less he got on base, the sillier I felt defending him on the grounds of his “baserunning genius.” Like a Joe Biden aide, I had a job to do, and I would do it, but privately, I knew he was cooked.",

The Chicago White Sox figured that out last year by reaching 100 in the last week of August and ending up with 121 losses, the second most defeats in baseball history.

Petrovic, skating past the side of the net, tried to gather a rebound and directed it with his left skate into the crease. It appeared that untouched it would have slid harmlessly through the crease, but Connor Hellebuyck, trying to clear the puck, angled it into his own net. Goal?

          "description": "Rafael Devers did what his bosses wanted. The Red Sox went out and grabbed a big-time addition over the winter, but to maximize their investment they needed Devers to shift away from his preferred position—the one he's been playing his entire career, and the one the Red Sox extended him a nine-figure contract to continue playing off into the future. Devers wasn't happy about the request and resisted for a while. He eventually caved, and then he endured an embarrassing, historically awful start to the season while adjusting to this new deal. But he's recovered admirably and been a reliable and productive contributor for a fun and competitive Red Sox team.\nNow the team is at it again. First baseman Triston Casas, off to a hateful, miserable start of his own, nuked his left knee while trying to beat out an infield single on May 2 and has been lost for the year. The Red Sox have since tried out Romy Gonzalez, Abraham Toro, and Nick Sogard over at first, with results that you would call broadly lousy—7-for-26 at the plate with zero extra-base hits—were it not for the fact that Casas was producing an OPS+ of [awful retching noises]. It's not that these are especially terrible baseball players—although scanning Toro's Baseball Reference page is causing an alarming intensification of the retching—but certainly none of those poor bozos is the sort of guy a team is eager to get into the lineup, least of all a team with semi-credible playoff aspirations.",

It didn't matter that Stuart Skinner, forced back into action after Calvin Pickard's injury, allowed fewer goals than he did in his two catastrophic starts against the Kings. And it didn't matter that, with the score 3–2 Vegas in the final few minutes, Connor McDavid unlocked the Golden Knights' defense with a little pass from the corner that went in off an enemy skate. All anyone's going to remember from Saturday night is the very last second, which is how Vegas managed to cut into Edmonton's 2–0 series lead.\nAny reasonable person would have been ready for overtime as William Karlsson broke into the offensive zone and took the puck behind the net with under five seconds to play. But in retrospect, when the VGK original sent the puck flying backward into the slot for another one of his expansion-season brethren, Reilly Smith, neither man had yet given up on the third period, and there was still enough time to inflict the knockout blow. Smith, using nearly every tenth of a second allotted to him, zoomed past a diving Oilers defender and tried to round a sliding Skinner as he fired a shot in the direction of the crease. The puck bounced so quickly that in real time, the closest official didn't see a goal. But replay review revealed the buzzer-beater, and worse, the person most responsible for it crossing the line.",

          "description": "The Boston Celtics and New York Knicks have played 149 minutes across three games of their second-round playoff series. The Celtics—the higher seeded team and the defending NBA champions—have led outright for about 128 minutes of that time, and the teams have spent about another 11 minutes tied, meaning the Knicks have led in this series for a little over 10 total minutes. The Celtics have gained leads of at least 20 points in each game, while the Knicks have never led by double digits; they have, in fact, never once had a three-possession lead. This isn't a real metric, I may have just made it up while I sat here, but: If you total together New York's maximum lead from each of the three games, and then multiply the sum by the total minutes they've spent in the lead, you get 90. If you do the same for the Celtics—20 points in Game 1, another 20 in Game 2, 31 points in Game 3, added together and then multiplied by total time in the lead—you get 9,088.\nThis is very dumb, meaningless math, but for some weird reason I have always been tickled by one number being way huger than another number. The Knicks have 90 units of advantage through three games, against Boston's 9,088: Wow! And also: Ha! By my dumb metric, it would be absolutely ludicrous to guess that the team holding the overall lead in the series today is the New York Knicks. But here we are! Boston needed a win Saturday to avoid falling into a 3–0 hole in a matchup that they have otherwise absolutely dominated.",

          "description": "In college, I briefly and unsuccessfully raced bikes, a humbling experience that taught me that the dog in me was not of requisite size to hang with anyone who wasn't a middling amateur. Every part of racing was a drain, from being nervously sardine-packed alongside dozens of other gangly 20-year-olds to figuring out when to burn energy and when to chill in the pack so that I actually had energy to burn. I never won anything or even came close, though loving bike racing means loving the draining stuff. That's all you can count on.\nThis is the right way to think about professional cycling, and really any form of racing. Think about this sort of competitive framework seriously enough, and you rub up against the limits of describing or thinking about racing in cold, analytical language. Easy and forgivable as it is to roll one's eyes at a conception of bike racing rooted in romantic notions like bravery, or the virtues of suffering with dignity, those do form the competitive substrate of the sport. Like most racing sports, cycling is foremost a pain tolerance contest. Strategic thinking is centered on how to trick other people into suffering more than you. How could you not think about guts, in both usages?",

She was old, and had been thinning in the way old dogs do in their final year, but still in all outward respects her loud, wiseass, insistent self, buzzing with impatience, shepherding my wife to bed at The Appointed Time, shoveling her snout under your hand and levering it onto her neck when she wanted pets: Bea.\nThen, on a Saturday evening in early April, she all at once flipped out at our other dog, Grover, when he came up behind her: Snarling and snapping, fighting as though for her life. We had to pull them apart. In the immediate aftermath, she was the most alarmingly depleted dog I have ever seen. She could scarcely stand. It was as though a band had snapped in there.

Immediately a horde of my coworkers began clowning my adherence to good computer hygiene, and even more so when I mentioned that I have been known to restart my computer four or five times a day.\nHere’s the thing: I am right and they are wrong. There is no reason to not shut down your computer, at the very least, at the end of the day, and boot it up fresh the next morning. Their qualms were easily batted away. Oh no, what about my tabs?!?!

The stories of career charlatans, egomaniacal has-beens, greedy televangelists, drug-addicted hustlers, hard-living gamblers, and human volcanoes ready to burst; the kinds of people who inspire Warren Zevon or Townes Van Zandt songs. No one has captured 21st-century America with more specificity, showing the comical obsessions—with hypermasculinity and accumulation—that always threaten to destroy us.\nIn 2009, McBride teamed up with his friends and collaborators from the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, namely Hill, Green, and Ben Best, to create Eastbound & Down. McBride played Kenny Powers, a John Rocker-meets-Jose Canseco type of baseball superstar at the worst point in his life. All of his money and success and chances to play had burned out, reducing him to moving in with his brother Dustin (John Hawkes) and filling in as a substitute PE teacher at the elementary school where his former love April (Katy Mixon) works. Eastbound proved that McBride and his team could take what might have been a silly sitcom and elevate it to a novelistic character study of man in a spiritual battle between his worst impulses and his desires for change and human connection. It was an instant hit.",

Four Edmonton goals, and none involved Leon Draisaitl or Connor McDavid? Not even a single measly assist? That can't be right. But it was true: For 75 minutes, including that ensuing overtime, Vegas clamped down on the Oilers' superlative-scoring duo, keeping them off the board and mostly away from any serious threats. They needed to do it for 76.\nThere was a lot to like about the game the Knights played, which makes the 5-4 result that much more painful. They made life miserable for Calvin Pickard, scoring four goals for the first time since Game 4 of the Wild series. They capitalized on two of their five power plays, Victor Olofsson scoring both times. Their kill was flawless, especially on a five-minute man-disadvantage in overtime. Their top skaters were buzzing, Jack Eichel contributing three assists and Mark Stone two apples of his own. They even mounted a stirring comeback, clawing back from 3-1 and then 4-2 in the third to send it to an extra frame.",

So far, he knows how to wave to people who like him, which is both something and maybe most of the actual job. The issue, here, is whether he grew up a Cubs fan, as originally reported, or whether he is, as his brother later told WGN News, a White Sox fan. He owes the world an answer, and that clarification better not be in Latin, or read out of some leather-bound book of ancient Hebrew—if the Pope has an opinion about DeWayne Wise, we’ll need to hear it in plain, nasally Chicagoan. Preferably while Archbishop of the 35th Avenue Diocese Harold Baines holds up a copy of the Sun-Times behind him.\nIt would not be unlike some surreptitious member of Big Cub, perhaps the shadowy Archbishop Bartman, to jump the gun on \"Pope Durocher,\" as they doubtless would call him. But let's say that the former Bobby Prevost’s brother John is right. Let’s say that the man who is now the pope did grow up a White Sox fan, in a household with a Cubs fan mother and a Cardinals fan father. There would, in this case, be some signs of pre-papal equanimity in making that compromise choice between two arch-rivals, and picking the White Sox would also make sense given that meek-inheriting-the-earth lie. He could put that debate to rest for good by beginning his papacy by forgiving all the Black Sox and Arnold Rothstein, too. But we can only speculate on such matters.",

          "description": "According to Hollywood, a surfer can be one of three things: a weed-smoking, wave-chasing airhead (Jeff Spicoli); a crunchy, woo-woo hippie (some of the penguins in the startlingly charming Surf’s Up); or an edgy, degenerate type, whose passion for adrenaline is paired with a generally violent demeanor (Patrick Swayze’s Bodhi in Point Break). The truth, as ever, is somewhere in between—you can expect even the gentlest of “soul-surfers” to hiss and fight over their home break. \nWhat, then, can we make of the unnamed protagonist (played by Nicholas Cage) in Lorcan Finnegan’s latest feature, The Surfer, beaten and humiliated in his quest to surf the Edenic waves of Luna Bay, the Australian beach where he grew up? Having been born there doesn’t grant him status as a local: “Don’t live here, don’t surf here,” goes the tag-line spat at him by the local crew. In the days leading up to Christmas, the surfer drives to the Bay to show his son the house where he grew up, which he is on the verge of buying back, if only he can outbid a competitive buyer. The surfer has long neglected his family, and a return to the wholesomeness of the beach—the beautiful surfing, the house perched on the cliff, the memory of an idyllic childhood—might help rebuild the relationships that have been sacrificed at the altar of his career.",

Previously, he'd worked as a proofreader and then project manager for a federal contractor that served federal health agencies, and Sebian-Lander saw this work as tremendously important, if slightly removed from his day-to-day life—\"they're doing work studying diseases I've never heard of or they're treating children's cancer,\" he said.\nOnce at the CFPB, however, Sebian-Lander immediately understood how that agency's work intersected with his own life. He graduated with student debt, and he and his wife took out a mortgage to buy their home. In his work on the CFPB's website, he maintained pages that shared educational information about auto loans, bank loans, credit cards, credit reports, and credit scores, and debt. \"It's all stuff that everybody has to deal with in a very existential way, even if you're a perfectly healthy person,\" he said.",

I was one of about 1,000 people watching it, according to YouTube at the time. Since then, about 12,000 people—out of a country of more than 341 million—have watched, though of course there's no way to know how many watched for more than the 30 seconds it takes YouTube to count a view. Like the sports-centered hearings that came before it, about steroids in baseball and sexual abuse in gymnastics, it was mostly political theater. Where it differed is in the intended audience. Previous hearings were about creating sound bites for television. This one was for the memes.\nOfficially, Wednesday's DOGE subcommittee was called to discuss the viral story about a fencer who refused to compete against another fencer in a minor competition because her opponent was a trans woman. In reality it was mostly yelling and grandstanding to be cut and clipped for the internet. The Republicans yelled at the Democrats. The Democrats yelled at the Republicans. The Republicans waved around Trump executive orders. The Democrats waved around charts.",

This is not a position that a 61-win defending champion is supposed to find itself in, so what the hell is going on here?\nIt can be frustrating to attempt any meaningful analysis of a Celtics loss, because the team's style of play only ever produces one answer: The three-point shot wasn't falling. The Celtics blew 20-point leads in both Game 1 and Game 2 because the shots they count on to go in simply did not. Boston set an NBA playoff record by missing 45 threes in Game 1, and lost Wednesday night's contest, 91-90, behind a 10-of-40 shooting display from behind the arc. If a few more of those shots hit at their average rate, the Celtics are up 2-0 right now.",

          "description": "Right after Mikko Rantanen completed his natural hat trick en route to a 3-2 Stars win in their series-opener in Winnipeg, Stars GM Jim Nill could've been forgiven for breaking out the slip 'n' slide goal celebration. It would have been ill-advised; suite carpeting burns something fierce. But this, in Dallas's wildest dreams and the worst nightmares of the two teams who previously employed him this season, is why the Stars bet the farm and mortgaged a few drafts to lock up the 28-year-old Finn for most of the next decade. At that moment, the winger was decidedly on a heater. Six of the last seven Stars goals, dating back to Game 7 against Colorado, had come off Rantanen's stick. Six of eight scored by anybody, on either team, were his. He racked up his consecutive hat tricks in just 14:53 of ice time. It is possible no one has even been hotter.\n\"The chance to acquire and extend one of the best forwards in the NHL is an opportunity that we couldn’t pass up,\" Nill said at the time, and while it's boilerplate front-officespeak, truisms don't get to be truisms without being, you know, true. Superstars don't come available often in this league, not in their primes, not in a league that sometimes seems designed to deny us the drama of player movement. And superstars win games. And Rantanen proved the difference between Dallas going home in the first round and beating the Avs—and, for the Avs, not having him was the reason they're booking tee times. Now he's got the Stars up a game, solving home-ice Connor Hellebuyck thrice.",

Howard is my age but got married late and is having his first child. Howard’s wife, Yesenia, is closer in age to him than to Jordon Hudson, so the arrival of this baby—her first child, as well—was never cleanly assured. A middle-aged pregnancy means that the mother and child are at a statistically higher risk for birth defects, miscarriage, and other terrifying complications. The mother also has to carry around a bowling ball sitting atop her bladder all day long. Tricky business.\nI remember all that from when my wife I had our own kids. I remember the fear. I remember the emergency bedrest. I remember long nights in an alarmingly bustling NICU. You find out you’re expecting and your instincts force you to account for everything that can go wrong.

So here's what I first noticed about Abundance, Ezra Klein's and Derek Thompson's zeitgeisty manifesto touting a construction-oriented liberalism: the wildlife. At risk of describing a jacket that you've already seen on a thousand podcast promo posts and airport bookstore racks, Abundance's cover depicts a planet neatly divided in two, with skyscrapers and farms and solar arrays juxtaposed against a jungly hemisphere replete with swooping birds and happy deer. It all recalls Half-Earth, the idea proposed by the biologist E.O. Wilson that 50 percent of our landscape should be devoted to the conservation of nature. So far, so good. \nLook a little closer, though, and you'll notice something odd: The animals don't really make sense, at least not on the cover of a book about American politics. The deer, which has the white spots of a fawn but the majestic rack of a trophy buck, is probably an Indian chital. The most conspicuous bird appears to be a scarlet ibis, a species native to South and Central America. Wherever you can find these fantastic beasts, it generally ain't this continent.",

          "description": "Cleveland's home crowd was caught chanting \"overrated\" at Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton during the second quarter of Tuesday night's Game 2. Donovan Mitchell, performing heroically for a severely depleted Cavaliers squad that was at that moment up 10 points, made an effort to discourage the chanting, but it persisted long enough to be picked up by TNT's microphones. This was a minor miracle: The production quality Tuesday was somehow even worse than it was Sunday. Greg Anthony's diving bell was even deeper into the Mariana Trench; the berserk home crowd's teeth-rattling clamor was reduced to an occasional slithering and shuffling; a bizarrely tuned court-side microphone managed to pick up no sound except for one Cavs fan screaming \"bullshit\" at key whistles. But the mics sure picked up that \"overrated\" chant. It's not that this is bad crowd behavior—it is, in fact, good and appropriate crowd behavior when facing a divisional foe in the playoffs—but it turned out that this was an unfortunate night to be caught on the record mocking Indiana's point guard.\nHaliburton was quiet for most of the night, but it was generally the good kind of quiet, a biding of time that suited the contours of the game. The Cavs, still without Darius Garland but now also without top perimeter defender De'Andre Hunter plus literal Defensive Player of the Year Evan Mobley, ramped up their defensive intensity, threw their deeply unsexy point-of-attack defenders way the hell up the floor, and helped on dribble-penetration like absolute demons. The effort and precision of it all was downright stirring to watch, and it flustered several of Indiana's ball-handlers, and before the Pacers had developed anything like an offensive rhythm the scoreboard showed them down 20 points. Presumably the crowd was losing it, though I will need someone who was there in person to confirm this.",

          "description": "The higher-seeded and hosting Boston Celtics lost Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series against the New York Knicks on Monday night, 108–105. The Celtics led by 16 at halftime, and by 20 midway through the third quarter, and then spent the rest of the night barfing into their laps. Here is the funniest number from the night: 45. That is how many three-point attempts the Celtics missed in Game 1. No NBA team has ever missed that many threes in a single playoff game before.\nEven at their best, the Celtics under coach Joe Mazzulla play offense with a kind of numbing actuarial bloodlessness: 3 > 2, forever and ever, and so they just keep huckin' up those three-pointers—an appalling 54 percent of their field goal attempts were threes this season, seven points higher than any other team—and trust the math, supported by their outstanding defense, to sort itself out. Last season it did, and they won the Finals, and they might do it again this year. At their worst, though, this approach lapses into what looks like team-wide obsessive-compulsive disorder, as it did on Monday night, with the game steadily slipping away from Boston for the final 18 minutes of regulation and the overtime period and the blank-eyed Celtics just continually pumping up those threes, clang-clang-clang. They attempted 49 field goals in the second half and overtime, and 37 of them were threes, and 27 of those threes were misses. Their third-quarter shot chart looks like a cry for help:",

          "description": "The way Amanda Cronin sees it, her environmental education began at the farmers' market in her hometown in New York's Hudson Valley. She marveled at the sheer abundance of produce, so much so that, at age 11, she became the market's on-camera personality. Every Saturday, she would go to the market and interview a farmer about their growing process, such as how olive oil becomes \"extra virgin.\" She tasted her first oysters and learned about the distinction between organic foods and other green-washed labels. Eventually she read Michael Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma, which cemented the idea that \"our food system is broken and Big Ag is really corrupt,\" she said.\nCronin started working directly for the planet at the age of 13. She interned for an organization called iMatter Youth, which encompassed youth-led organizing for the climate crisis. \"Because I was so young, I couldn't really be a full-time employee,\" she said. iMatter Youth's mission was to train youth activists across the country to make changes at a municipal level, exposing Cronin not just to the power of environmental policy, but the concept of environmental justice: the idea that everyone, regardless of race, class, or any other identity, deserves the same environmental protections and benefits. The idea just made sense to her. \"I grew up in a very privileged place where I had access to clean water, clean air, a backyard to roam around in,\" she said. \"I didn't have to worry about living near a power plant, or have direct environmental harms.\"",

          "description": "NFL kicker Justin Tucker is currently under investigation by the league because 16 massage therapists have accused him of sexual misconduct. On Monday, he was released by the only team he's ever played for, the Baltimore Ravens. But if those two things are related, the Ravens are pointedly refusing to admit it.\nThe way that Baltimore announced Tucker's exit would have made perfect sense if you saw it before January, when his claim to fame was still his lengthy run of incredible accuracy. The 35-year-old had a team-friendly out in his contract for this offseason, and he's coming off the least effective year of his career. To that end, this statement—credited to EVP and GM Eric DeCosta—has all the hallmarks of a typical farewell to a beloved veteran-in-decline. \"Sometimes football decisions are incredibly difficult, and this is one of those instances,\" it begins, presumably to avoid giving grounds for a potential NFLPA grievance.",

          "description": "After a long courting period and the slow march of inevitability, Trent Alexander-Arnold confirmed on Monday that he will be leaving Liverpool this summer, almost certainly to take his talents to Spain and Real Madrid. The news is hardly a shock, since reliable reports had for several months been saying this was going to happen, but it's still noteworthy that the local lad, who has spent his entire youth and senior careers as a Pool Boy, is leaving Merseyside to test himself at the biggest club in the world.\nPut that way, you can't fault Alexander-Arnold, who won everything with Liverpool in his nine first-team seasons, including two Premier League trophies. The England international has appeared 330 times for Liverpool, scoring 21 goals and notching 82 often incredible assists (64 of those came in the Premier League, a record for a defender), and though he may have taken some reputational knocks for his lackluster defending, there's little to criticize about his tenure at his boyhood club, which also included an FA Cup, two League Cups, and the 2018-19 Champions League trophy. For almost the entirety of his time marauding down the right flank as a right back/playmaker/passing genius, Alexander-Arnold was one of the engines that drove Liverpool in this era of success, and his partnership especially with Mohamed Salah made opposing left backs squirm under repeated interplays and pinpoint crosses.",

          "description": "The night your author got Popped came at the onset of an epic hangover nobody quite knew about yet. More specifically, it came early in the 2017 Western Conference Finals that elevated the Golden State Warriors and slowly but surely undid the San Antonio Spurs. Two days earlier, Kawhi Leonard had landed on Zaza Pachulia's foot on a shot in front of the San Antonio bench, ending his season and obliterating most of the next. That moment fundamentally changed the ensuing years of professional basketball more than any other player, team, or event. Nobody knew that then, of course, but it dawned on Gregg Popovich before it did for anyone except perhaps Leonard himself.\nThe Spurs, who were up 76-55 in the third quarter of the game when Leonard got hurt, went on to lose it 113-111; they dropped Game 2 by the score of 136-100, and then lost the two after that. Until that moment the Spurs had been, in the previous 20 years under Popovich, demonstrably and by a wide margin the best team in the sport; since then, they are 25th.",

It's a big change from the last time they faced Florida, when, two years ago, in their only taste of the second round in forever, they went down 0-3 in the series and fell in five. And yet this win tastes a little bitter, because of the I-word: implications. It's got 'em, thanks to Sam Bennett forcing goalie Anthony Stolarz from the game with an elbow to the head.\nThere hasn't been a formal update on Stolarz, but he was taken to the hospital for observation in an ambulance, after cameras caught him vomiting on the bench a few minutes after the Bennett hit—classic concussion stuff. He's out of the hospital this morning, at least. There was no penalty called on the play, and it's not clear if Bennett will face supplemental discipline from the league, but the Leafs were furious. \"Elbow to the head,\" head coach Craig Berube said. \"Clearly. Clear as day. I'm not sure why there wasn't a call on it, but it was clearly a penalty.\"",

The opposing team is getting ready to inbound the ball from under their own basket, they have no timeouts, and their best player is stuck on the bench. Do you foul and send them to the line, or trust your ferocious defenders—I forgot to mention that you have the best defense in the league—to get set and deal with what will surely be a semi-panicked attempt to fling up a potential game-tying shot? If you're Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault, you choose to lose the game.\nIt is always cruel and simplistic to hang a bad result on one play, decision, or even set of decisions, but Daigneault cannot be spared the hot light of scrutiny after he and the Thunder fumbled away Game 1 of their second-round series against the Denver Nuggets. The Thunder were up 11 with 4:31 left to play, and seemed ready to put away a game that they had led and dominated all night. A shocking 12-2 Nuggets run made it 115-114 with 1:07 to play, which is about when the bad decisions started being made. The teams traded misses on the next two possessions, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander ended up at the line with 14 seconds left. He hit both free throws to put the Thunder up by three.",
