          "description": "Taco Bell's Cheesy Melty Grilled Steak Burrito is a value-priced offering featuring marinated grilled steak, seasoned rice, a three-cheese blend (mozzarella, cheddar, and pepper jack), reduced-fat sour cream, and Creamy Jalapeno Sauce, wrapped up in a soft flour tortilla.\n\nI bought one for $3.29.\nThe burrito had a nice heft to it. It was nicely folded and tightly rolled.\nThere was an even, though somewhat sparse, distribution of mildly seasoned steak inside. Unfortunately, the distribution of the sour cream and Creamy Jalapeno Sauce was not so even. My initial bites of the burrito were full of sour cream, while the Creamy Jalapeno Sauce was gathered at the other end. So I was mostly tasting one sauce or the other in many bites. There's a mild heat from the Creamy Jalapeno Sauce to go with a jalapeno-inflected mayo base.\n\n\n\nThe second flavor driver of the burrito was the seasoned rice, which had a nice flavor, but I would have liked a bit more presence from the steak.\nThe cheeses provided a nice melt and stretch, but didn't make much of a showing in the taste department. Although it features in the name, there wasn't a whole lot of cheese to go around.\n\n\n\nOverall, Taco Bell's Cheesy Melty Grilled Steak Burrito made for a filling meal for an affordable price. Flavor-wise, it was overly familiar and light on steak.

          "description": "Chewy Chips Ahoy! x Stranger Things Limited-Edition Cookies feature a chocolaty base with fudge chips and a red strawberry-flavored filling. The filling is meant to peek through cracks in the cookies in a way reminiscent of the rift entrances in the TV series.\n\nThe suggested price for a 9.9 package is $5.79, but I received this courtesy of Chips Ahoy!.\n\n\n\nThe visual \"rift\" effect wasn't working on my batch of cookies. Rather than the red filling showing through, the cookies just had sealed cracks across the surface, which made them more crumbly and prone to breaking than the typical batch of Chewy Chips Ahoy! cookies.\n\n\n\nThe chocolaty base had the same soft and chewy texture as regular Chewy Chips Ahoy! but with a pleasant chocolaty flavor that gave it a brownie-like feel. The fudge chips were intermittent but delivered a deeper chocolaty flavor and smooth, melty texture.\nThe strawberry-flavored filling was similar in texture to the creme of an Oreo, only firmer. In terms of taste, it had an enjoyable and moderate strawberry flavor that went with the chocolate of the cookie.\n\n\n\nTaken altogether, Chewy Chips Ahoy! x Stranger Things Limited-Edition Cookies were good but not great for me. I might think differently if I were a bigger fan of chocolate strawberries.\nNutritional Info - Chewy Chips Ahoy! x Stranger Things Cookies\nServing Size - Two cookies (31g)\nCalories - 140\nFat - 6g (Saturated Fat - 3.5g)\nSodium - 110mg\nCarbs - 21g (Sugar - 12g)\nProtein - 1g\nRead more at Brand Eating!",
