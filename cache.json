After a couple of weeks of on-the-town reporting and extensive testing of all available entertainment options, I can officially confirm: The best form of entertainment is solving jigsaw puzzles at the municipal library.\nI have visited two local libraries, and this is enough of a sample size to conclude that all suburban libraries must have a communal puzzling–type situation. One (my town's library) had a communal puzzle table with the pieces laid down flat, and another (the neighboring town's library) had a sort of inclined board covered in felt that wooden puzzle pieces stuck to—kinder on the neck but more difficult to slide large chunks of puzzle about. Anyone can work on the puzzle. Once the puzzle is completed, it is swapped out with a new one, which means a theoretically infinite supply of free puzzles. Sounds like a bargain to me!",

The snail darter swims in rivers and streams in America's South and the delta smelt can only be found in a single estuary in California. But the fish have more in common than you might think. Both snail darters and delta smelt are freshwater fish that are native to the U.S. Both species have been listed as endangered at some point and subsequently become the lodestar of a controversial conservation battle. And both fish are in the news this week.\nThese two species collided in the news for seemingly different reasons—the darter starred in a new paper arguing it is actually not a distinct species, and the smelt was unlucky enough to become the subject of a tenuously coherent response from Donald Trump to a question about the L.A. wildfires. Two odd little fish making national headlines in one week might seem like a coincidence, but these fish are more entangled than they'll ever know. (How could they know? They're fish.) They tell a story about the process of science and conservation, and how blameless species become scapegoats for quagmires of our own making.",

Never have I experienced a media scrum that felt more like a mosh pit than the one surrounding Roki Sasaki’s agent Joel Wolfe at MLB’s Winter Meetings. The presser moved quickly, not just in terms of the brisk cadence of questions and answers but physically moved—from a corner in the Hilton Anatole’s Grand Ballroom, which acted as the media workroom, onto the stage with the podium and the MLB logo backdrop. Journalists followed Wolfe until they were crowding around the stage like they were at a basement show.\nWolfe addressed the scrum with a microphone that didn’t always work—adding to the DIY show feel, come to think of it—while fielding but not quite answering questions about where the most interesting international free agent in years would be likely to sign. That, honestly, is where the comparison to a punk show ends. Everything else is pure transactional offseason baseball, with a generous side order of rules—all of it just about the least punk thing imaginable.",

I mean, what other program has a kicker with a chiropractor on call to come in every week and keep his bones aligned?\nThe kicker in question, Mitch Jeter, hit a 41-yard field goal with 12 seconds left to give the Irish a 27-24 victory in a highly disjointed game that for three quarters looked like it should have been played in a rainstorm. The chiropractor in question, Andrew Jeter, is his dad, who flew in each week to work on his son's directionally challenged leg after a hip injury. The conferences that Notre Dame are not in, the story goes, mean they don't have to share their playoff payoff with anyone else, giving them a leg up to keep Jeter's leg up.",

We recorded it Tuesday morning, in what turned out to be the last remotely normal-seeming moments of the week in that region. It's a fun episode, but because things have gotten very bad in Los Angeles in the days since we recorded, and because of the extent to which that reality is absent from the episode ... well, this was a good opportunity for me to remind myself that the name of the podcast is The Distraction, and then to say it until I believed it.",

          "description": "Any time you get Cleveland and Oklahoma City into the first sentence of your blog, you can be reasonably sure that no one from either coast of North America will read it all the way to the end. The pressure's off! I can fill this blog with anything I like! Therefore I am choosing to spend the next several paragraphs sermonizing about the divine skills of Cleveland big man Evan Mobley. Mobley and the Cavaliers prevailed Wednesday night over the visiting Thunder, in a matchup of teams carrying combined 25-game active win streaks. This was a great game, from beginning to end, and if you ignored it because you consider these to be flyover teams, you deserve to feel bad this morning.\nMobley was incredible. Cavaliers head coach Kenny Atkinson is putting him everywhere on the floor and using him in as many ways as possible. The Cavaliers run normal-ish stuff to get the ball moving toward the basket, but Mobley's particular gifts make all the actions a tick or two more dangerous than they'd be if you replaced him with a normal-ish NBA big man. Consider the dribble handoff, or DHO. It's a staple of the modern game, but NBA defenses are getting better at defending it, so that it often feels less like a powerful go-to and more like some shit your team does by lazy habit, or from lack of any better ideas. In a DHO, the ball is passed to a big man up the floor, near the free-throw line. Guards and shooters whir around the arc; the big man takes a hard dribble or two parallel to the free-throw line and hands the ball off to one of his buds, who pulls a sprinting defender into a collision with the big man, and is thus freed to slice down the middle of the floor. All the quick-moving action around the perimeter creates secondary opportunities, but this is the basic action: a big guy lumbering sideways and punching the ball into the tummy of a teammate while absorbing into his own tummy his teammate's defender.",

And buy Drew’s book, The Night The Lights Went Out, through here.\nThe advent of a 14-team playoff field in the NFL has forever neutered the possibility that a deserving team might not make it into the bracket. Not that you could make such arguments convincingly before; it’s not like I’m shedding tears for Matt Cassel and the 2008 Patriots. But a smaller field made the idea of bubble teams just plausible enough for Stephen A. Smith to make his best “Excuse me?!” face whenever a boring-ass 10-win team somehow got excluded. Any team that misses the playoffs now is one that indisputably deserves to, regardless of its preseason expectations or standout individual performances. You thought you could get in with style points, but you can’t. You are scum. Garbage. Dogshit. The Raiders by another name.",

          "description": "I didn't watch the Winter Classic. I can't even blame that fact on the teams involved, shit-ass as they may have been, because the draw of an outdoor game is almost entirely the venue: the visuals, the pageantry, the novelty of a hockey game in a non-hockey building under the open sky. The reason I didn't watch was that I hadn't realized until the morning of the game that it was being held on Dec. 31 instead of the usual New Year's Day, and by that point I already had plans, and canceling plans to watch Blues–Blackhawks is a great way to lose friends and gain regrets.\nI liked it when it was New Year's Day. It's a perfect day for sports: I'm almost certainly not leaving the house, and I'd like something pretty and low-stakes to watch. I also liked that the NHL had its day. Every other league has its day. The NBA has Christmas. The NFL, which greedily wants Christmas for itself but will never truly own it, has the Super Bowl, which is basically a holiday already. MLB has its summer holidays, days off work being ideal for afternoon first pitches. And New Year's Day was for hockey.",

          "description": "Hell is always a little bit nearer at hand in the Western Conference. In the East you can want to be bad, and try to be bad, and in fact be quite bad, and still host a playoff series. Not so in the West: In the West it's possible to want to be good, to try to be good, and to be very close to good, and to wake up every morning in hell. The Phoenix Suns are in hell. They're not even the only ones. The Warriors are in hell. The Kings are in hell. Each of these teams, if they were in the East, might make the Finals. Well, probably not the Kings.\nThe Suns opened the season in great form, winning eight of nine against a reasonably diverse set of opponents. None of the wins were particularly convincing, but a strength of a veteran roster, like Phoenix's, is that it should reliably out-execute and outperform opponents in the clutch. You would expect a team led by Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and Bradley Beal to win a majority of its close games, if for no other reason than by pure shot-making brilliance. With game-to-game load management, with reasonable (read: non-Thibs-ian) minutes limits, and with Phoenix's stars' own wisely calibrated distributions of effort, you would not bat an eyelash at the Suns posting the modest net rating of an also-ran while winning 70 percent of their games. What I am getting at is the Suns don't necessarily need to dominate every night in order to convince themselves or anyone else that they are a serious contender. Their form to start the season was more or less exactly what you'd expect.",

          "description": "Golden State Warriors fans come by their belief in the occult honestly. They have been mesmerized by the varied and bewildering sorceries of Stephen Curry and all within his purview for more than a decade now, and no bad moment or game cannot be scrubbed clean within the time it takes for his next 37-foot jumper with one second left on the shot clock to go from fingertip to net. His most strident critics, both of them, believe he should have to play while wearing a spangly black-and-purple caftan with crescent moons and stars and a pointy hat. That's his deal, pure and simple.\nThus, it is a bafflement to them that he and the team he enchants are suddenly trafficking with the Washington Wizards, who we know from our reading are the very antithesis of magic. In the last 21 games, or one fourth of a season, the Warriors with Curry are 6-15, with the latest example being last night's 114-98 hammering at the hands of the Jimmy-Butler-free Miami Heat. The game was a slow-cold build from the beginning to the point where the Warriors fell behind by 20 with two minutes left; they led for four minutes and never after the first quarter. They are not only 6-15, they are 5-9 at home in that stretch, which means they are 1-6 on the road and about to embark on a four-game roadie against the Pistons, Pacers, Raptors and Timberwolves. This would have been a 3-1 trip at worse in the good old days; now, 1-3 seems like it would be satisfactory given the circumstances.",

Perhaps they were away at Rutgers that week.\nIt is possibly the kitschiest Penn State product I have ever seen. It was made by George LaVanish, a talented artist who worked for the school and still lives in the state, and is dated 1986. In my memory there was a lot of Penn State wall art in that basement, and that was not unusual. I knew plenty of people in Philadelphia with full Penn State rooms, some of whom hadn’t even attended the school. But they liked college football, and Penn State was the best team that could conceivably be considered local. There remain a lot of Penn State fans in Philadelphia.",

          "description": "On Monday, Sheel Seidler, the widow of former Padres chairman Peter Seidler, filed a complaint against two of the latter's brothers over control of the team. The complaint alleges that Matthew and Robert Seidler, as successor trustees to Peter Seidler's trust, failed to comply with their fiduciary duties to Sheel Seidler, the sole beneficiary of the trust, including by withholding funds and using the trust as a \"piggybank\" to enrich themselves. It also states that Peter Seidler wished for his wife to become the control person of the team, including a handwritten ranking with his wife and children at the top. After Peter Seidler's death, his eldest brother John was instead submitted to MLB as the Padres' next control person.\nA spokesman for the Seidler Trusts released a statement calling Sheel Seidler's complaint \"entirely without merit.\" According to the statement, the trustee of Seidler's trust was solely responsible for appointing the next control person, and in 2020, when Peter Seidler took control of the team, Sheel Seidler had agreed that she \"had no right to be or to designate the Control Person and that she would not interfere with the designated Control Person.\" It also alleged that Sheel Seidler had agreed in May 2024 that John Seidler would be the best control person for the team. The statement did not address the issue of whether or not Matthew and Robert Seidler had mismanaged the trust, which, while likely being a more salient moral-legal issue at the crux of the complaint, is less relevant to the general public.",

          "description": "It is not very difficult to learn true and useful things about the new congestion pricing toll system that New York City switched on last weekend, but it is much easier to learn untrue things about it. The program itself is easy to understand; this post at Gothamist, to pick one of many, lays out both the broad strokes and the particulars in a lucid way, as does the city's website. While New York's is the first congestion pricing gambit of its kind in the United States, previous examples in London (which implemented it in 2003) and Stockholm (which did so in 2006) offer some sense of how it might work both in practice and in terms of how quickly people will get used to it. Congestion pricing has been coming into existence, fitfully and fretfully and in public, since 2007; there's a site where you can track the differences in traffic delays since the program finally went into effect just after midnight on Saturday.\nThe program could and probably should be simpler, and it is nice if also a little sad to imagine a different and more readily governable world in which it would be. In this one there are ins and outs and what-have-you's as there are with any bit of ambitious public policy, and carve-outs and compromises and concessions as there will be in any bit of public policy that inconveniences noisy and powerful constituencies, and hanging over it all there is the familiar element of lurid furious grievance inherent to every policy debate concerned with how people use cars. Given how atrophied and sclerotic and abstracted and plainly corrupt state and local government is, and not to put too fine a point on it but further given how absolutely fucking insane people become whenever they feel that their natural right to Do Car Stuff is being infringed upon, even this sort of tenuous and robustly caveated neoliberal intervention both feels and mostly is revolutionary.",
