In the meantime it's just sitting there, docked to the ISS, possibly haunted.\nThis weekend, astronaut Butch Wilmore radioed Misson Control to let them know strange sounds were coming from Starliner's speakers. He held his microphone up to the speakers to capture the sound, described as \"a pulsing noise, almost like a sonar ping.\" Again: Not great that it's making mysterious noises, but since it is, might as well look on the bright side that it wasn't chanting in backward Latin or somethng.",

          "description": "There is an auditory component to the James Wood Experience. For one thing, Washington's 21-year-old phenom outfielder hits baseballs real hard. Every time a baseball is hit real hard, a loud noise is produced. I realize that the thing I am about to say is speculative, or even mystical, and possibly offensive to the very concept of science, but: There are certain baseball players who hit the ball louder even when they have not necessarily hit it faster or farther. Most of these players are themselves very large. Wood's bat makes a distinct, crisp, ringing thwack sound even on grounders and foul balls and liners the other way. The thwack elongates and deepens into a thwock when he really connects, sonorous and even pulpy, an upsetting noise that registers in an atavistic part of the human brain as a signal of terrible violence. A home run off the bat of Wood (or Shohei Ohtani, or Aaron Judge, or Giancarlo Stanton) has this more primal resonance; the information it conveys in a split second causes a spontaneous, involuntary yelping reaction.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09SDwWJMeas",

          "description": "If Donald Trump does something once, he will generally go on doing it. The ramshackle sum of his rancid being amounts to all the things that he started doing and never stopped doing, not so much despite being told to stop but because of it. A lot of lousy people are like this. Instead of ever figuring out what kind of person they wished to become, they simply accumulate and compound; instead of finding something to care about, they just figure out what they can get away with. While it seems in retrospect inevitable that Donald Trump would eventually have lent his name and the ripe, buffed meme-ified version of his face to an oafish NFT hustle, it absolutely was inevitable that he would continue to do it.\nThat first batch of NFTs, which arrived just in time for Christmas in 2022, was garish and slapdash even by the degraded standards of that scene; NFTs had long since begun their initial descent into punchline territory, but the run sold out. A financial disclosure earlier this month revealed that Trump has made $7 million from his NFT licensing agreement, which is much more than the $300,000 he reported having earned on the line of Trump-branded bibles he promotes in association with \"God Bless The U.S.A.\" singer Lee Greenwood.",

          "description": "For several years now, Brighton and Hove Albion has possessed the Mandate of Video Game Heaven. This is a title soccer's (nerdy?) gods bestow upon clubs, usually modest ones, who most closely adhere to the precepts of team-building and play that generations of gamer-prophets, through countless hours of solitary, ascetic communion with games like FIFA and Football Manager, have discovered as the one true way. This path involves scouring the world (or consulting one of those online player databases and sorting by highest potential) for the most promising young, undeveloped, undervalued talents, signing them, cultivating their gifts in an adventurous tactical setup, rising up the table and divisions, selling some of those talents once their explosions inevitably catch the eyes of the big clubs, reinvesting that money into more and even brighter prospects, and continuing the cycle until your club has become one of those big clubs.\nThough it's admittedly much easier to pull off this strategy in the digital world, the rewards for those who successfully implement a version of it in real life are substantial. Brighton is a great example of the favor this Mandate of Video Game Heaven can grant. Since Tony Bloom became majority owner in 2009, the Seagulls have risen from being a small-time, third-tier outfit to now being not only Premier League mainstays, but one of the most fascinating and exciting clubs in Europe. They've done so by bringing in innovative managers, signing lots of players whom their scouts believed have more to give than they've previously shown, getting the best out of those talents, selling well and then reinvesting even better, and generally behaving exactly like a savvy gamer would had one taken over Brighton in FM10. The pinnacle came in the 2022-23 season, when manager Roberto De Zerbi led a group featuring the likes of Alexis Mac Allister, Moisés Caicedo, Leandro Troussard, and Pascal Gross to a sixth-place finish, a spot in the Europa League, and some of the coolest play in England.",

In a space full of portraits and busts—a room of black faces—hers immediately stood out. Warm and reflective, the gaze of the titular girl is turned away from the perspective of the viewer. Still, there’s something in her upright posture, in the firm set fingers on the wooden stool beneath her, that betrays her awareness that she’s being observed. She’s certainly dressed to be seen. A spray of pink flowers cascades over her brown shoulder. Her hair is delicately, elegantly coiffed. She doesn’t shrink under our observation. Her expression is not one of a girl surveilled. She’s at ease in her finery, at ease being regarded.  \nGirl in Pink Dress is one of several of Waring’s paintings that were featured in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s recent exhibition, “The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism,” which ran from February through July of this year. The exhibition is the second of its kind at the Met and can be read as a sort of corrective to the first: the 1969 exhibition “Harlem on My Mind,” which included photographs by the legendary James Van Der Zee but didn’t feature a single painting or sculpture by a black American artist. “Harlem on My Mind” was met with near universal censure by the black artists it claimed to represent, who picketed outside the museum with signs that read “Harlem on Whose Mind?”",

          "description": "On Aug. 17, David Roche destroyed the course record at the Leadville Trail 100. The performance was, objectively, spectacular. Leadville is one of the iconic races in ultrarunning, a 100-mile beast that wildly fluctuates in elevation on a trail in the Rocky Mountains; Roche beat a course record that had stood for 19 years. As impressive as it was, an unthinkable record goes down seemingly every weekend in ultrarunning, which is currently going through the same evolutionary spasm as all endurance events.\nWhat was fascinating was how Roche did it. Leadville was the first-ever 100-miler for the 36-year-old, and the longtime writer and coach trained for it in extremely unconventional fashion.",

Johnny was 31, and Matthew was 29.\nThe brothers, originally from New Jersey, were in the area for their sister Katie's wedding, which was scheduled for Friday. Around 8:00 p.m., police say, the driver of a Jeep Grand Cherokee hit them from behind while trying to pass an SUV that had made room for the bikers. The driver has been charged with two counts of death by auto, and police suspect that the driver had been drinking.",

And I believed him. While the 28-year-old Dutchman plays some smooth and intuitive tennis, his hazy, tranquilized affect would be more common among SoundCloud rappers than among people in his profession. A 6-1, 7-5, 6-4 victory over tennis's happiest boy was basically a test of ascetic willpower: Is it possible to feel nothing after defeating the player who just strung together Roland Garros, Wimbledon, and an Olympic silver medal? Does one not shout after handing the boy-king his first genuinely bad loss at the majors? Buddha would envy the blissful n…",
