          "description": "There's nothing quite like an exciting Sunday Night Football game. After a day of sitting on the couch mainlining RedZone, it's a nice, healthy step-down to sit back and enjoy just one game in the moment. If that game delivers, then all the better. There have been some fun ones this season, even as recently as last weekend with the Jared Goff interceptionpalooza. But for my money, Sunday's match-up between the Chargers and Bengals was the best Sunday night game of the season. Both teams, at separate times and sometimes at the same time, looked like they were trying to gift the game away; this somehow only made the game itself more compelling. A battle of weaponized incompetence might not sound like riveting viewing, but both teams traded periods of dominance across 60 minutes, and the only reason really that the Chargers came out ahead 34-27 is that they choked just a bit less in the final quarter.\nIf you want to be more generous than that, the Chargers won because they executed one more time than the Bengals did in the fourth, but that would ignore how Los Angeles built up a comfortable 27-6 lead on the arm of Justin Herbert, only to abruptly and completely forget how to play defense. Let's start with Herbert, though, because he was absolutely dealing in the first half. Herbert completed his first six passes on the night for 123 yards and two TDs, the first of which was a beautiful laser down the seam to tight end Will Dissly. The second was even better, as Herbert took a wide bootleg right before swerving left and leaving his feet for a bullet to a wide open Quentin Johnson in the end zone:",

          "description": "It's no surprise that the Bills and the Chiefs played a high-stakes thriller that was decided when one of their quarterbacks made a spectacular play. But there was still no way, really, to be prepared for Buffalo QB Josh Allen's improv in the most nerve-wracking of spots—up two with just over two minutes to play, facing fourth-and-two on the KC 26. Fail to the gain the yards (or opt to kick a field goal), and the Bills would be handing the ball over to Patrick Mahomes with the opportunity for a game-winning two-minute drill. Instead, Allen seized the victory for himself by beating every Chiefs defender to the end zone.\nKansas City rushed four against Buffalo's five blockers, but Allen was still able to spot a crease in the defense as he stepped up in the pocket. With two wideouts going to the sticks on the right, and another target at the same distance on his left, there was just enough of an opening in the middle for Allen to acquire the yardage he needed. But he didn't stop there. Accelerating toward the goal line, he made one diving tackler fall helplessly at his heels, shrugged off another who tried to fly at his arm, and powered through safety Bryan Cook as he fell triumphantly into the blue paint. The Bills had their two-score lead, and the defense did their part to make the final line 30-21.",

          "description": "If you want to understand what makes De'Aaron Fox's game so effective and cool, the most important thing to understand is something of a signature Fox play: the surprise fast break. Several times per game, while the opposing team is in the process of setting up its halfcourt defense with obvious spatial and manpower advantages, Fox will see an opening and sprint with the ball directly into the heart of that defense, creating either a layup for himself or a wide open shot for a teammate. The sorts of gaps he pries open are not available to any other ball-handler on any other team, because nobody else in the NBA is as demon-quick as Fox, or as insistent on applying pressure in seemingly disadvantageous situations. \nYou can apply the logic of the surprise fast break forward to explain the rest of his game, and as he showed over a historic weekend, the highest level of that game is startling.",

On any given day, you could assign credit to Barbra Banda's attacking ferocity, Marta's ageless orchestration, or the league's stingiest defense. But in order to make it through an entire season with only two losses, you need the reliable presence of all three of those things, and more. Truly great teams are great as a matter of course. This is something that the Kansas City Current learned on Sunday, as they fell to the Pride, 3-2, in the league semifinal.\nThe final score conceals the convincing nature of Orlando's victory, which was claimed in the 82nd minute through an act of eye-watering beauty crafted by the best player in history. Everything that happened after Marta scored to give the Pride a 3-1 lead—16 minutes of stoppage time, the Current getting a goal back thanks to a fluky handball in the box, Banda leaving the game with an injury—may as well not have happened, because the game had already been defined for good by Marta's feat:",

          "description": "If you'd asked me 20 years ago, I would have said confidently that Wayne Gretzky's NHL record of 894 career goals was unbreakable. It was a curio to be admired, not a number to be chased; like Cy Young's 511 wins, it came from a different era, almost a different sport entirely. If you'd asked me one year ago, when Alex Ovechkin was scuffling with five goals, which is all he'd still have even a month later, I'd have considered the chase a tragicomedy—an ancient Ovi, looking so washed up he should be talking to a volleyball, puttering his way through sad season after sad season, long after he should have retired, making his team worse. It would have been awful; it would have lessened both the record and Ovechkin's career. \nI'll extend myself some forgiveness for thinking it was over, that guys pushing 40 don't tend to have slumps, or at least not slumps that end. I would have done well to recall Ovechkin's quote from more than a decade ago, a sign that he probably stresses the least of anyone over his goalscoring droughts. \"Right now I’m scoring goals and I’m the king of the world,\" he said. \"And a couple weeks ago I was almost in the toilet. So maybe you just forget to flush me.\"",

          "description": "It is only moderately useful context for one of the drearier sporting events in recent memory that, by his own telling, Mike Tyson nearly died six weeks before his fight with Jake Paul, which finally glitched and lurched and went the whole bleak distance late Friday night, was first scheduled to happen. This was in late May, when what was reported as an ulcer flare-up left Tyson vomiting blood in an airplane bathroom and then in a hospital. \"I lost 25 pounds in 11 days,\" Tyson told New York Magazine. \"Every time I went to the bathroom it smelled like tar. Didn't even smell like shit anymore.\" Tyson told New York that he had \"like, eight blood transfusions. The doctor said I lost half my blood.\" The fight was delayed from late July to mid-November.\nIt is rude but not really inaccurate to say that Tyson looked like someone who'd had a recent near-death experience, or like someone who had turned 58 back in June, on Friday night. He did and he did, and none of that qualified as a surprise or even really a disappointment. Tyson had retired in 2005 and endured all manner of bad physical and financial health and personal tragedy since; with the exception of two exhibitions, in 2006 and 2020, he hadn't shown any indication that he wanted to fight at all. He was pretty definitive about it after that last loss, to Kevin McBride; \"I don't have it anymore,\" Tyson said then. \"I've got the ability to stay in shape, but I don't have the fight and guts...I don't have this in my heart anymore.\" In the last two decades, Tyson remade his public image and seemingly himself; he has a cannabis brand and a podcast and a meditation practice. He is jarringly earnest, sometimes to kid reporters.",

The pygmy seahorse Hippocampus bargibanti lives only on knobbly, branched corals called gorgonian sea-fans, where its own, equally lumpish body is perfectly camouflaged. When Takahata cut off a branch of the seahorse's coral, a handful of worms spilled out.\nShe brought the worms to Chloé Julie Loïs Fourreau, a graduate student in the same lab at the university, who studies worms. \"At that time I didn’t even know about this species and wasn’t looking for them,\" Fourreau wrote in an email. But when Fourreau looked into the literature, she identified them as Haplosyllis anthogorgicola, a species of polychaete worm that was first described in 1956 and then never recorded again. The researchers had unwittingly rediscovered a long-lost species of a tiny, nearly transparent worm about as long as a green lentil. Their paper on this rediscovery, \"The Trojan seahorse,\" was published recently in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",

          "description": "There is something bleakly inspiring about the fact that despite the total saturation of sports culture with the brand and business, there appears to be no way to make sports gambling feel like anything but poisonously bad vibes. People are still doing it and sometimes wrecking their lives in the process. The gambling concerns that sit atop the industry are propping up what's left of sports media with their advertising expenditures, and bending coverage toward their own cheesy ends. A government that only grudgingly restrains predatory industries like this one, under the best of circumstances, is not remotely under the best of circumstances. None of this appears to be going anywhere, but it is also not getting any less repellent. Sounds like podcast stuff to me!",

That line of thinking misses a key thing that McCain has in him, which is: That Dog. McCain is a hooper's hooper, and the main aspect of McCain's game that has struck me through the serious hot stretch he's enjoying, aside from the discrete basketball skills he's showing off, is his ironclad mentality. He's operating like he's the best player on the court at all times, which I think is as important for young players adjusting to NBA speed as hitting open shots or making rotations. To belong, you have to believe you belong, and if there's one thing that makes me optimistic McCain will stick, it's his confidence.",

Surrounding you is nothing but the strangely cheery hum of the casino that occupies the main floor of this hotel: bright and colorful screens, verdant felt gaming tables, cartoonish bloops and farts emanating from all of the machines, even the ones not being used. The playlist is solid but also relentless, following you anywhere you walk. You’re one of the few people here right now, but the ambience of the casino doesn’t make it feel that way.

          "description": "Disgraced former NFL coach Jon Gruden has spent the last few years desperately trying to return to his craft. Gruden lost his head coaching job with the Las Vegas Raiders in 2021, after emails in which he used racist, homophobic, and sexist language were leaked to the press. In one of those emails, he wrote that \"Dumboriss Smith has lips the size of michellin tires,\" in reference to then-NFLPA head DeMaurice Smith. Gruden resigned from his position with the Raiders in October 2021, and then popped up the following year, sporting a Mark Davis-lite haircut, to half-heartedly apologize for the things he wrote.\nThat didn't do the trick, so Gruden has spent the last two years coming up with other ideas. He managed to weasel his way into the Kansas City Chiefs' training camp this past summer, but that didn't lead to any jobs. Then he sat down for a profile with CBS Sports in September, in which he revealed that his new goal was to get a job coaching college football. Still, no coaching opportunities materialized, which left Gruden stranded with one final option: content creation.",

          "description": "What exactly is the Utah Hockey Club? I can give you the obvious answers: They're an NHL team playing its first season in Salt Lake City; they're the reanimated corpse of the Arizona Coyotes; they're a company that still hasn't settled on an name for its product. But none of those mean a whole lot in the context of actually watching a game. To fans of other teams, their presence on the schedule remains abstract and unfamiliar—detached from any memories of past experiences. For those in Utah, they're by definition your team, but you don't really know the players yet, haven't gotten used to the rhythm of week-by-week hot and cold streaks. It's like living with a new roommate; you may be open-minded and even optimistic, but there's a lot of blank space left to fill.\nThe Carolina Hurricanes do not have this issue. As they've made the playoffs in six straight years under head coach Rod Brind'Amour, they've established one of the firmest identities in the NHL. With longtime players like Sebastian Aho, Marty Nečas, Andrei Svechnikov, Jordan Staal, and Jaccob Slavin, you know exactly what you're getting when you play the Canes: a team that will do everything they can to maximize shot differential and win by out-possessing their opponents. Utah got the quintessential Canes experience at home on Wednesday night, getting outshot 50-21. But with a statement-making third period that began with fireworks and ended safely in Karel Vejmelka's glove, they picked up an unlikely and inspiring 4-1 win.",

          "description": "For me, seeing a screen in a theater is like seeing a bank logo at Pride. We don’t need that here! This space is about living, breathing, three-dimensional people. And I’m not just talking about the tiny cell-phone screens that light up in the rows around me—though, obviously, put those away. I mean when a Broadway production devotes a chunk of its stage to images of the actors instead of the actors themselves. When I go to the theater, I like to feel myself disappear into the production, and a screen is inherently distancing—a copy of the real thing. Every once in a while, like in Ivo Van Hove’s production of Network, the presence of a screen makes diegetic sense. But mostly, like in Ivo Van Hove’s production of West Side Story, the staging makes you wonder if you should have just gone to an IMAX theater instead—a place where person-to-person empathy is supposed to be subsumed by spectacle. But if any production can make an argument for these screens as experience-enhancers rather than mere shiny toys, it’s Sunset Blvd., the new staging of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, which feels like the trendiest thing to see on Broadway this holiday season.\nWhen the 23-foot LCD screen swung down from the ceiling to magnify Tom Francis’s harried face in the show’s early going, I was a little bit relieved, against my traditionalist instincts. You see, I had one of the worst seats in the house at the St. James Theatre—any farther away and I’d be watching The Hills Of California across the street. And because I was so high up, and could see no details whatsoever of anyone’s face, I appreciated the Jumbotron-esque assistance provided by the compact camera rig Francis held in front of him. But as it kept returning, I was confronted by the inevitable question: Do you look at the real thing, or the larger-than-life thing? It was only at the start of the second act, when that decision was made for the audience, that I could embrace the full extent of the possibility that the Broadway camera offered.",
