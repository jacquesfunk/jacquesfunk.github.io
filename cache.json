          "description": "Across the entire spectrum of great American icons, there is no one quite like David Lynch. He was a walking enigma: an artist’s artist who was also somehow mainstream, an unapologetic esotericist whose work still managed to be immediately though ineffably understood, a well-known and highly regarded director who was nevertheless completely underrated. He’s arguably the most influential filmmaker of the last 50 years, and though many have tried, no one has been able to walk down the lane he invented with 1977's Eraserhead.\nLynch died on Thursday at the age of 78. He had recently been suffering from emphysema due to complications from COVID, which kept him homebound. It's another blow for Los Angeles in a grim month, since, along with being one of our great filmmakers, he was one of those luminary chroniclers of LA, on par with Joan Didion, Mike Davis, John Singleton, and Tupac.

          "description": "Halfway through the first quarter of Oklahoma City's blowout revenge win over the Cavaliers on Thursday, Max Strus hit a corner three to give Cleveland a two-point lead. That bucket would turn out to be quite a lonely one. The Thunder immediately ripped off a 30-2 run, a rugged sequence that highlighted the qualities that make them so great on both sides of the ball. \nConsider that Oklahoma City lost the first game between these teams in large part because of the opponent's dominant duo of bigs, came into this one even smaller thanks to Isaiah Hartenstein's injury, and yet ran away with the win. The Thunder's lack of size, rather than dooming them, forced them to play compounded Thunderball and in the process showed what makes them special. Watch them work, and you'll see a coherent philosophy unifying the ways they operate on both offense and defense, one built around the drive. It is a philosophy of pressure.",

Their two games were stay-in-your-chair fascinating, even Thursday night's blowout 'Der win, which followed a game eight days earlier in which the Cavs out-delivered OKC. A case can be made that their matchup is the only one that can save a season of ratings regret and regression, and it raises the same questions that were being asked a decade ago:\nCan the NBA thrive with a championship series with two non-marquee teams? More to the point, a bunch of non-marquee players? And finally, why does that matter?",

I'd look at the Los Angeles skyline at whatever shade of yellow-orange-brown muck the fires had delivered that day and take a photo, and then I'd scurry back inside. Against my better judgment, one time I took my mask off for one second and immediately felt ill. The entire city smelled like a funeral pyre.\nBack inside, I would turn on my TV, switch it to a local news station, and leave it on all day. I wouldn't shut it off until a few hours before bed, when my husband and I would watch some scripted TV to unwind—unless the flames were getting a little too close, which only happened once. Local TV news and its updates became the soundtrack of my days, complete with its bright graphics, specific music, and the parade of weary-but-pulling-through-it anchors tossing to extremely awake but often harried live reporters. It was from local TV where I learned where to donate supplies for those who lost everything in the fires. It was on local TV that I—and many Angelenos—learned about a fire in the Hollywood Hills, later dubbed the Sunset Fire, that sparked up Wednesday night and required immediate evacuations in the heart of Hollywood. And it was on local TV where I first heard the stories of the people who died.",

It happened early in the second quarter, with the Ravens leading 7-0 and the Steelers facing a third-and-2 from their own 28. Russell Wilson flipped a pass toward the right flat to tight end Pat Freiermuth. Just after the 6-foot-5, 258-pound Freiermuth caught the ball, Ravens safety Ar’Darius Washington—who stands all of 5-8, 180—came smashing into him. Washington proved to be no fly on Freiermuth’s windshield. He quickly brought Freiermuth to the ground just short of the sticks.\nRather than risk failure on fourth-and-1, Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin decided to punt. It goes without saying that this was cowardice, even though it was the Steelers’ inability to gain one yard on back-to-back plays that contributed to the previous week’s loss to the Bengals. ”We have to be able to make routine plays routinely,” Tomlin would later say.",

This bill applies not just to college-aged athletes, but also to kids as young as kindergarten.\nSupporters of the legislation really, really want you to believe this is all about fairness. It’s in the name of the bill: Banning trans women would protect cis women athletes (somehow). In affirming his support, the California Congressman Doug LaMalfa expressed outrage at the idea that “XY chromosome males” were currently “taking the place of women and girls in sports,” an analysis of the current situation that is just as darkly conspiratorial as it is bogus.",

          "description": "It is not difficult to find people who loved Bob Uecker unreservedly. There is a good reason for this: He was the last genuinely and instinctively funny person in baseball history. He was the god of Milwaukee even if you include all the Green Bay Packers going back to before Vince Lombardi. He was the face and voice of baseball cinema, the man whose line-reading made \"Ju-u-u-u-st a bit outside\" so good that \"iconic\" doesn't remotely cover its impact. Even if you're not a seamhead, you likely came across Bob Uecker and smiled.\nSo Thursday's announcement that Uecker has died at age 90, due to small cell lung cancer, came as a blow. Nine decades is a good long run, but there was never a sense that he was running out of material; Uecker was still a joy to hear on Brewers broadcasts even in Year 54 of being the voice of Wisconsin baseball for two-and-a-half generations. The reaction to his passing was unanimous in the same ways and for the same reasons that the response to Vin Scully’s death was unanimous—it was an outpouring of both sadness at the loss and gratitude for all the time we got to spend with him. In an epochally angry time in America, at a moment when it isn't hard to find even anti-puppy polemics with a keystroke, Uecker gets a pass from most everyone. Yes he defined baseball, but he also managed to become more than merely Mister Baseball. From the moment of his first appearance on Johnny Carson's definitive version of the Tonight Show, which Uecker earned merely by mastering the tripartite arts of comedy writing, unabashed self-deprecation, and martini-dry humor, he was recognizable as that rarest of Americans, the guy you'd sit back down to listen to even if you were already halfway out the door. Put another way, Norm Macdonald thought he was one of the funniest men he ever met. Beat that with a stick.",

Crazy Raccoon needed to win the fight to extend the match and their tank player, Junbin, had a play to make. Playing as the hero Mauga, he prepared to use the Cage Fight ultimate ability, one of the most powerful abilities in the game. \nBut as the fight broke out between the two teams, Team Falcons' support player, Fielder, playing Brigitte, was closely tracking Junbin's movements. When Junbin hit the Q button on his keyboard, initiating his ultimate ability, Fielder was left with just milliseconds to intervene. He rushed in and fired off a perfectly timed shield bash, stunning Junbin's character and cancelling the ultimate before the on-screen animation could complete. Overwatch matches, particularly those played at a high level, are often won and lost between pixels, and in this case Fielder's reflexes made Team Falcons world champions.",

          "description": "The Milwaukee Bucks have posted a 20–10 record since the first week of November, rising over that time from the bottom of the East up to fourth. Their rotten start certainly will continue to weigh on their playoff positioning—they can entirely forget about fighting for the East's top seed—but the Bucks are now clear of the play-in mess. An honest sizing-up of the field suggests things will probably stay this way: The couple of semi-credible teams behind them in the standings are either crabbed to hell (Orlando) or caught in states of dopey semi-seriousness (Indiana and Atlanta). Pending further notice, the Bucks are no longer Milwaukee Butt.\nOn Wednesday night, they beat the hell out of a Magic team stripped by injury of all but one of their handful of guys capable of making the basketball go into the basket. This was a laugher from very early on. Orlando led, 9–8, after a slow start, but from about the 7:30 mark of the first quarter the Bucks ripped off 19 straight points, and then went ahead by 26 points early in the second quarter. The game was never much of a contest again.",

          "description": "Since Jan. 7, devastating fires in and around Los Angeles have burned more than 40,000 acres of land, an area slightly larger than Washington D.C. They have razed or damaged more than 12,300 homes and other structures. At least 24 people have died. This number will likely rise as the fires continue to burn and leave communities with not only the lingering carcinogenic effects of wildfire smoke, but also the chemicals emitted as buildings burn. Although the particulars of the destruction may have been unpredictable, the fires were not. Southern California has been bone dry for the better part of a year, and temperatures in the American Southwest have been warmer than average over the past three months. One climate scientist, Daniel Swain of the University of California Los Angeles, wrote a blog post on Jan. 4 warning that \"a high-end offshore wind/fire event may unfold in SoCal this week.\"\nTo grasp the full extent of the conditions that sparked the fires, it is important not just to look to this last, dry summer but also the unusually wet winters that preceded it. This cycle between extremely dry conditions and extremely wet conditions is known as \"hydroclimate whiplash,\" and in an eerie coincidence, Swain and colleagues, including Danielle Touma, a climate scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, published a review paper on the subject this week, in the journal Nature Reviews Earth & Environment. As Touma noted, such coincidences are likely to become more commonplace as extreme weather events become more frequent amid climate change.",

          "description": "Sometimes, I remember how it felt to believe. The aching, constant hum that was always inside me. Faith is not always the rare and precious feeling of wonder that arrives without warning, when the nature of the world stretches out in front of you and catches in your throat. That is awe, which can—if you believe—reinvigorate the faithful, remind them of glory and power and majesty. But faith itself is like love: as magical and revolutionary as it is mundane and commonplace.\nReal faith exhausts. It demands. It becomes rote even for the most ardent. There is a reason that most churches adopt some kind of liturgy; you cannot reinvent a wheel that must be constantly in use. To believe something with every atom of your being requires you to let it take over. There are only so many awe-inspiring moments in a life; most of a life is sweeping the floor and clicking on the computer and running an errand. Faith is not what you do in a church on Sunday; faith is a whole life.",

There wasn't even that much snow, by Lake Erie standards, but Delta Airlines didn't seem to care that I had 10 pounds of potatoes to grate for a Chanukah party the next day and was leaving to visit my mother the day after that. There was no open seat to New York that night, nor the next day until 9:00 p.m. I was stuck. I was despondent.\nI had dated a guy from the Cleveland suburbs in my 20s long enough to learn the hard way that there's not all that much to recommend in the city. But I vaguely remembered that locals there love to brag about their art museum, and that seemed like a better way to pass the time than walking forlornly around an empty, windblown downtown. I booked a room in the hotel across the street from the Cleveland Museum of Art. I figured I'd spend an hour breezing through the gallery the next morning and then find something else to distract myself from my plight.",

          "description": "Things are going badly for Barcelona forward Ansu Fati. The 22-year-old's career prospects have been dwindling for something like four straight years, as a succession of leg injuries (and accompanying extended absences) have thrown him miles off the developmental track that once made him one of the world's brightest wonderteens. After returning from an unfruitful loan to Brighton for the 2023–24 season, he now finds himself an afterthought at Barça. Lately he cannot even break into match-day squads. The holder of several records as the youngest-ever goalscorer in this or that competition has not scored or assisted in any competition in more than a year.\nIf he is to have any realistic chance of rebuilding his career, Fati very clearly needs to leave Barcelona, either on a permanent transfer or an extended loan to a smaller club where he can get lots and lots of playing time. Unfortunately, his gargantuan salary, negotiated several leg-kablooeys ago, makes this a very difficult circle to square. The kind of club that could afford to take on his wage generally would not pay that much for, or dedicate guaranteed buckets of playing time to, such a dubious reclamation project; the kind of club that could guarantee him buckets of playing time would have to mangle its squad salary structure to pay him. Meanwhile you can imagine why a 22-year-old who has had more knee surgeries than completed 90-minute match appearances in the past half decade might balk at the idea of an 80-percent pay cut for the sake of leaving a club he joined as a 10-year-old. It's a tough situation! But that's not really what this blog is about.",

I've written plenty about how impressive the Reds have been under Arne Slot this season, and I'm sure I'll write plenty more. The team currently in second place, however, deserves some flowers as well, as Nottingham Forest, the little money tree that could, just finished taking four points from its two matches against that same Liverpool. After handing the league leaders what is still their only league loss of the season back in September, and at Anfield to boot, on Tuesday Forest played hosts and came out with a 1-1 draw that served to further solidify the Trees' table-scaling legitimacy.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpZfE1QY1j8",

          "description": "On Monday night, I booted up League Pass to watch the end of Pistons-Knicks, and I was treated to a spectacular finish, with Malik Beasley hitting huge threes and talking wild shit while Cade Cunningham cooked two All-NBA defenders en route to another star-making performance. During a replay review, I flipped over to Warriors-Raptors, where I got to see Buddy Hield legitimate a Chris Boucher masterclass with a signature moment of comedic hubris, the sort only he is capable of. After those games wrapped, I locked in for the fourth quarter of Grizzlies-Rockets, the best frame of the night. There was Ja Morant, nailing halfcourt bombs and frying the most athletic player in the NBA; there was Jalen Green, finishing up an efficient 42-point night and continuing his impressive, important January; and there was Amen Thompson, doing his pure destroyer act.\nIt was an amazing night of basketball, one that, according to a certain discursive strain, does not matter—or at any rate matters less than the question of how many people watched it on TV. NBA ratings squawking is not a novel phenomenon, nor an interesting one. Every year, the season starts while the World Series and football season are in full swing, and so some people watch those things instead of NBA basketball. And because that happens alongside cable television's general slide into the abyss, the numbers wobble. Then those allergic to context form grandiose theories, mistaking the relative viewership decline for an absolute one and linking it to any number of bogeymen: load management, too many three-pointers, or, most cynically of all, wokeness, which is another word for \"black people on my television.\"",
