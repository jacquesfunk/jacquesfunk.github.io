Shots will go in or not go in at aberrant rates in the short term, which doesn't tell you much, but the processes by which teams generate good shots and prevent their opponents from doing so tell you plenty. Some qualities, then, that the Milwaukee Bucks have shown through five games: unconnected, slow, stinky, creatively adrift, thin, and generally miserable.\nThe Bucks are 1-5, winners in Philadelphia on the second night of the season and then losers of five straight, with double-digit losses to the Bulls and Nets in there. They lost a heartbreaker to the Cavs on Saturday as Donovan Mitchell nailed a tough game-winner. The vibes are not great: Doc Rivers is all but openly wailing on the sidelines; Giannis Antetokounmpo is sitting through garbage time in a daze; Khris Middleton, who had surgery on both ankles this summer, has not played yet this season; Darvin Ham is on the bench; and the guy he brought with him from L.A., Taurean Prince, is giving quotes like, \"I just feel like defensively, our IQ has to go up.\" They are currently the biggest disappointment in the NBA, under circumstances that are not altogether that surprising.",

          "description": "All the issues that arise from the Ballon d'Or stem from misaligned expectations. Even after almost 70 years of footballers winning the thing, it's still unclear to many what exactly soccer's most prestigious individual prize is actually for. Is it meant to go to the single best player in the world? The best player on the best team? Should the winner have scored the most goals? Won the most trophies? How do you weigh club performances with national team ones? Does it even make sense to try to isolate and award an individual in what is an indivisibly collective sport? Is this whole affair so stupid, the criteria so unclear, the voters so random, the concept so flawed, that nobody should even care about it in the first place?\nFor better and for worse, the answer to all of those questions is \"it depends.\" Sometimes it's easy, when the best player in the world wins literally everything for club and country and there's no need for a multifactorial analysis. Other times, as was the case for the men's Ballon d'Or this year, no candidate's case is undeniable, and so you're forced to wade into the subjectivity muck. It's these non-obvious Ballon d'Or years that bring the controversy, but also make it more interesting by sharpening what exactly the award is getting at. And this year's men's BdO was one of the most controversial ones ever.",

That is as determinate of a statement as can be made on the interaction, as the story broke via a series of confusing and contradictory reports that first characterized it as an assault. It doesn't seem nearly that severe, but the NBA has confirmed it is investigating the matter.\n\"We are aware of reports of an incident in the Sixers locker room this evening and are commencing an investigation,\" an NBA spokesman said. The public first became aware when Keith Pompey, in the most egregiously out-of-order manner possible, tweeted, \"Oh, boy, people will remember the Sixers season for all the wrong reasons. The team just dropped to 1-4 and Joel Embiid assaulted a reporter in the locker room.\" In a deleted reply to a fan asking for clarification of what exactly Embiid had done to the unnamed reporter, Pompey said Embiid \"punched him.\" Twenty minutes later, ESPN's Shams Charania confirmed that an \"altercation\" took place, noting that Embiid took issue with Hayes's latest and clarifying, \"Embiid shoved the columnist. No punch.\" Charania's colleague Ramona Shelburne provided the detail that the \"shove was to the reporter's shoulder.\"",

Not for reasons of miserliness or whatever; I simply live in a spooky-looking (at night) log cabin at the end of a very long and dark driveway branching off of a winding and hilly forest road in a low-density area. If any trick-or-treaters have visited my home in the seven Halloweens I've lived here, they were very small, dressed very convincingly as squirrels and raccoons, and left without knocking on the door.\nI've had occasion, nevertheless, to form Halloween candy opinions and judgments in that time, from taking my own kids trick-or-treating. Raising kids in an area (\"neighborhood\" would be inappropriate, here; it's just a road with some houses alongside) where trick-or-treating basically does not happen, you learn where the good nearby trick-or-treating districts are, and you travel to them. This means that pretty much by definition, for the past seven years my kids have trick-or-treated on Halloween only in places known to be especially good for the practice, where there are lots of decorated houses, lots of costumed trick-or-treaters, and lots of friendly people giving out lots of candy.",

Sure, I could come up with a reason for a day trip to say, Collingswood or Haddonfield, but that hardly felt legitimate enough to forfeit the mystique. Judging by the dress of the people who left the stations, PATCO served commuters; when I eventually rode the PATCO Speedline, it should be to commute.\nI'll admit, I was appalled when the prospect of a Defector Atlantic City retreat cropped up. But while Atlantic City offered to my colleagues sportsbooks and blackjack and craps and a sense of glamour, it offered me something much less sick in the head: an opportunity to ride a new and mysterious transit line. Once I realized this fact, I was, shall we say, on board.",

The haunted are almost always from the north of England, except for the ones in post-World War II Tokyo. They are obsessive and prone to paranoia, as the haunted tend to be; their self-destructive streaks are galvanic and inescapable. The worse things get—things always get worse—the hauntings become propulsive, dissociative experiences. It’s fitting that the late Mark Fisher, high priest of Hauntology, was a big fan. “You are not living with the dead. You are living with the living,” Philip Roth wrote in Sabbath’s Theater. Peace’s characters aren’t afforded such merciful clarity. As one of the many disordered minds in 1977 muses repeatedly: \n“This is why people die.\nThis is why.”\nThis is why people.",

          "description": "Japanese RPGs (JRPGs for short) do a lot of things right, but one thing they are not particularly known for is respecting the player's time. Whereas Western AAA games like Horizon: Zero Dawn, Assassin's Creed, or even the newer Legend of Zelda entries, pad their runtimes with open-world shenanigans, JRPGs usually earn their 100-plus hour runtimes the old-fashioned way: with a slow pace, lots of cutscenes and dialog, and grinding monsters for experience. At times, playing a JRPG can feel like watching a particularly engaging anime, if during every commercial break had you complete a puzzle or fight a monster before getting back to the show.\nMetaphor: ReFantazio (let's get this out of the way: the name is dumb) isn't immune to this, especially at the beginning. The newest game from Japanese developer Atlus, makers of the Persona series as well as the more hardcore Shin Megami Tensei series, is a bit of a slow burn. Like their breakthrough masterpiece Persona 5 before it, the first couple of hours of Metaphor are an extended tutorial, which in practice boils down to doing scripted fights in between grand cutscenes that lay out the setting.",

That's not to dismiss his overall postseason contributions—he had an uneventful World Series, and an amusing stretch of only getting clutch hits, but considering the sample size his numbers pan out as perfectly respectable, if not to expectation. Then again, the expectation was Ohtani's typical narrative inevitability. Something like, say, in the very first game of the NLDS, when the Dodgers were down three runs in the second inning, and Ohtani smashed a high fastball from Padres ace Dylan Cease to tie the game in one swing. After six seasons without postseason Ohtani, suddenly there he was.\nNone of the other postseason days had quite the same feel as the first, due to a combination of Ohtani's aforementioned perfectly respectable struggles and the Dodgers' postseason tendency to win or lose games by large margins. But even when Ohtani wasn't getting on base, he had presence. For one, there was that broadcast graphic counting down the batters until he would arrive at the plate. Then there was the shoulder injury scare. And because Ohtani is Ohtani, even his failures had import. In the fifth inning of the Dodgers' series-clinching Game 5, Gerrit Cole struck out Ohtani's fellow 80 FV prospect Gavin Lux with the bases loaded. Fine: It's Gavin Lux. But then Cole struck out Ohtani, and that meant something. It's a simple truism—big players make big moments feel bigger—but, well, there you have it.",

The cosmic scriptwriters, working within the boundaries imposed by Bronny's limitations as a basketball player, did their best. It was never going to be a significant bucket in the story of a basketball game, because Bronny isn't very good and the Lakers are, or certainly intend to be. The setting was nice, though: The bucket came in the fourth quarter of a road game against Bronny's hometown Cavaliers, in the only visit his Lakers will make to Cleveland this regular season. It so happened that the Lakers, off to an otherwise encouraging 3–1 start under new head coach and dynamic podcaster J.J. Redick, were in the process of getting comprehensively pantsed by the home team, leaving Bronny to handle the bad kind of mop-up duties. \nBronny checked into the game with just over five minutes left in the fourth quarter, to a loud \"Bron-ny\" chant from welcoming Cavs fans, who by that point had been calling for him on and off for about three straight minutes of game action. The buzz continued, crescendoing whenever Bronny touched the ball over the next few Lakers possessions. Then, with about 2:15 left on the clock, Bronny pushed the ball down to the Cleveland baseline, retreated a few steps, jabbed as if to use a screen toward the middle of the court, and pulled up for a contested mid-ranger. The noise in the arena suggested a playoff game, including a huge pop when the shot fell.",

Particularly in this World Series, which the Dodgers wrapped triumphantly on Wednesday night, all of those synonyms were put to good use in each game.\nTo wit: In Game 1, Freddie Freeman's walk-off big fly made him an instant legend. In Game 2, L.A. won on the strength of a tater from Tommy Edman, a bomb from Teoscar Hernández, and a round-tripper from Freeman. In Game 3, the difference-maker once more was a Freeman dong. In Game 4, the Yankees got a morale boost from an Anthony Volpe grand salami. And in Game 5, New York was off and running early thanks to a jack from Aaron Judge, a blast from Jazz Chisholm, and a Giancarlo Stanton pancake to right.

They were still pretty good in 2012, which was Andre Ethier's last good season, Chad Billingsley's last healthy one, and Kenley Jansen's first as a full-time closer. They improved from 86 to 92 wins in 2013 and have not been below 91 wins or out of the playoffs in any full season since. They won just one World Series in that stretch, and it was both fully earned—the Dodgers had an absurd .712 winning percentage when they won the version of the World Series that ended the plague-warped mini-season of 2020—and somehow not really an outlier. The Dodgers won 111 games in 2022, for an equally absurd .715 winning percentage, and that team didn't survive the NLDS. The Phillies team that made it through to the World Series that year won 87.\nIt doesn't feel quite right to say that the Dodgers were cheated out of World Series wins during any of those years, with the possible exception of the semi-year in which they actually won it. They have been in the postseason for nearly a decade and a half, and have during that time become the model organization in the sport—as astute and farsighted as the most financially optimized franchises, as detail-oriented and forward-thinking as the most development-oriented, richer and more ambitious than just about any other team in the sport, and exactly as cynical as everyone else. It would have been strange if the Dodgers didn't win a World Series somewhere in there, although it wouldn't have felt quite right—it wouldn't have been appropriately October-coded or appropriately Dodgers—if it wasn't a little stupid when it finally happened.",
