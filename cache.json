Super Bowl 59, for all the highlights it generated and the broader satisfaction of its thoroughness, was more or less erasing itself as it happened; by the time it finally lapsed into the Rob Lowe-hosted game show that followed it on FOX, it was pretty much gone and the long sports winter already felt deep and endless. For Defector, this is both a challenge, because there just aren't a lot of sports happening right now, and something of an opportunity to stretch out a little bit, write some anglerfish fiction and jarringly vivid descriptions of bad smells and the like.",

Being this big, it seems, should render blue whales impervious to predators. But just as no bank is too big to fail, no whale is too big to totally evade being eaten by the ocean's top predator. Killer whales prey on nearly every large animal species found in the ocean, and blue whales are no exception.\nIn 2022, scientists confirmed that a pod of orcas can take down an adult blue whale, not to mention the smaller calves they frequently hunt. \"Killer whale attacks on large whales is the biggest predation event that occurs on the planet,\" Robert Pitman, a researcher with the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University, wrote in an email. \"There probably hasn’t been anything on that scale since dinosaurs roamed the earth.\"",

It would be incoherent to anyone who sneaked a peek, but it's a very useful piece of infrastructure in my life. It's a list of entrees, basically, with sections separated by planned grocery store trips. There are no specific dates attached, but the list is reverse chronological: Whatever I'm going to eat next is at the top, and my future meals proceed from there. At the very bottom are meals I want to make but don't have an assigned spot in the batting order yet.\nThe document is adjusted and revised often, which is why I don't lock in any meal to a particular day. When I make social plans that involve eating, or would cause me to miss a meal, I do some shuffling. As I write this, though, \"food.txt\" stretches out eight weeks in advance—pastas, chicken recipes, tacos, even a tentative visit to a bagel shop. It sounds very intense, I know. It's a symptom of an anxious mind that leans heavily on structures and plans. But I'm still kind of proud of how I got here.",

Given her own stellar play in that series, and the combined shortcomings of the referees and her backcourt in Game 5, she was right to be. These days, she is no less angry. In an interview with Taylor Rooks in January, prefacing that she might “get beef for saying this,” Collier declared that she would never get over the loss. When Rooks asked her what she meant by “getting beef,” Collier explained, “People just calling me a sore loser. I’m like, I am a sore loser. It sucks! I agree with you. I am very sore about losing.” \nOne of the problems the startup basketball league Unrivaled was meant to solve was that WNBA stars’ overseas arrangements kept them out of sight, out of mind for a long time. To brands or corporate sponsors, it was hardly ideal for a potential endorser to spend only half the year stateside. To fans and players, there was something else frustrating about these big offseason gaps. Last impressions are strong, and six months is too much time to keep stewing in them.",

          "description": "Almost four years after agreeing to buy the Minnesota Timberwolves from Glen Taylor, Alex Rodriguez and Diapers.com tycoon Marc Lore have won an arbitration case that will allow them to finally take control of the team. A three-person arbitration panel issued its ruling on Monday, voting 2-1 to let them advance to the final steps of seeing out a contract they agreed to, which Taylor was trying to wriggle out of. The mechanics of that vote, and the process it guaranteed, are far more arcane than simply and immediately transferring ownership, but the upshot is that Taylor is out and the Business Boys are in. It's the story of NBA ownership over the past two decades in miniature.\nTaylor has always been a bad owner. This is not always the simplest thing to judge, as a team's performance in the short and even medium term can exceed the willingness of its ownership group to do the two things that distinguish a \"good\" owner: pay the luxury tax for a good team and, most importantly, shut up and get out of the way. You can't always get both, and many fans would settle for one or the other. Marc Cuban, former Dallas Mavericks majority owner and now Mavericks minority owner, was never willing to abide by the latter clause, though he regularly paid the tax when his teams were in contention. Memphis Grizzlies owner Robert Pera has learned to keep himself out of the public eye—after Sports Illustrated reported that he wanted then-coach Dave Joerger to wear a headset so Pera could personally call in plays—though he is staunchly unwilling to pay the luxury tax.",

Where family walks with leashed dogs happened down the middle of intentionally curved streets named after long demolished natural landmarks like \"Timbercrest\" and \"Forest Trails.\" Where the HOA (because of course there was an HOA) banned the installation of driveway basketball hoops.\nReceiving industrial freight deliveries, freshly cleared through international customs, probably wasn't explicitly prohibited in the homeowner's handbook.

          "description": "The Civilization series has been a load-bearing pillar of the video game industry dating back to 1991, and though the series has gone through many changes throughout its history, the core gameplay has generally stayed the same. Players pick a civilization with an attached leader, then guide it from the early stages of humanity into the near future. It's a tried-and-true formula that has had enough wrinkles to not just thrive for 34 years, but also inspire enough passion in its different iterations to have rabid fanatics of each game. (For my money, Civilization V is the best one, even though I played VI the most.) Civilization VII tries something new, something so fundamentally different that at times it feels like a Civ competitor more than a proper new entry in the series. It shouldn't work, and it often doesn't, but the evolution, really the revolution, that comes with the seventh installment of this long-running series is thrilling even in its flaws.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV0waX2uPLg",

The acquittal of the police officers filmed brutalizing Rodney King triggered a paroxysm of riots and violence in the city. To Butler and many others, it felt like the apotheosis of a number of untenable realities. As a writer of science fiction, Butler took the anxieties she felt—about social rot and political atrophy, about a vision of capitalism poised somewhere between merely dehumanizing and actively anti-human, about climate collapse and social collapse—and turned them into a story that was both more speculative and more full of possibility than the news. Parable of the Sower, which was published in 1993, begins in the year 2024.\nThe book tells the story of Lauren Oya Olamina, a brilliant and supernaturally sensitive 15-year-old growing up in a town that sits on the outskirts of a collapsing Los Angeles, and in every way on the verge of a deep abyss. Her experience of the dying world around her fuels a vision of a new faith, called Earthseed; when circumstances force Lauren out into that world, she and that faith are tested over and over again as she and a collection of fellow travelers look for safety in a very dangerous country. It's not any more uplifting or much less harrowing than it sounds—I haven't finished reading it yet, but I'm not expecting a big comeback for Society—and the many ways in which it has proved prescient do not make it any easier to take. But it did give the book, which was well-reviewed in its time and became a cornerstone of Butler's legacy, a long and uneasy second life. In the fall of 2020, at what felt like the bottom of the pandemic, 27 years after it was first published, and 14 years after Butler's death, Parable of the Sower became a New York Times bestseller.",

He's averaged 26 points, 10 rebounds, and six assists in those games, and he's gotten to play three of them alongside Tyrese Maxey and Paul George. Embiid's on the floor and the Big Three is finally reaching an operational state; things are finally starting to turn around in Philadelphia, right?\nThe Sixers are 1-3 since Embiid returned to the lineup (George did not play in the game they won), and each has produced footage of Embiid that one might describe as \"alarming.\" He shot 38 percent from the field in last Friday's loss to the Pistons, and in 30 minutes of action was able to put together a highlight reel of awkward flailing. Last night's game against the Raptors produced what might be a new low point in Embiid's season. Down two with 16 seconds left, Embiid set a screen for Maxey at the top of the three-point line and then popped into space. Maxey zipped the ball to his wide-open big man, who lined up a potential game-winning three, hesitated, awkwardly drove into the defense, and then just kind of ... dribbled the ball off the back of his own head?",

          "description": "I was sleepwatching through the first two episodes of Severance. It’s not an easy show to get into. It’s sterile because it’s supposed to be—it’s a show about a biotech company called Lumon whose employees have the option of severing their brains so that one version of them goes to the office (the “innie”), while the other (the “outie”) can just live their life. Neither of them ever has to meet—they do not share a consciousness. It’s a clear indictment of corporate culture and the modern workplace in general, the soulless bullshit jobness of it all, but that can almost make it a little hard to stay with it because it can be alienating. The first season has Mark (Adam Scott) leading his co-workers, including game new hire Helly (Britt Lower), award-driven Dylan (Zach Cherry) and company man Irving (John Turturro) on a mutiny. The second season brings them back, with Lumon clearly attempting a pivot to various superficial perks in order to lull the team back into sedation. And this is where we are in the third episode, with a confused Dylan being led to Lumon’s security room. \nWhen he arrives, it’s an eerie scene, like all the scenes in the series where some form of real-life attempts to invade the corporate space. A wall of screens shows a disarmingly mall-grade portrait of Dylan and a woman who appears to be his wife. That woman appears to be Merritt Wever, who just might be my favorite actress in the world.",

After five weeks, your excitement has probably worn off and you've probably had a share of good and bad days to muddle through. Your Defector pals have just finished their fifth week of The Artist's Way, a 12-week course on creativity created by Julia Cameron, and the novelty has certainly worn off for a lot of us. But that doesn't mean there weren't little breakthroughs along the way. It's tempting to think of something like The Artist's Way as a quick(ish) fix for any and all creative and existential woes, but the kinds of changes many of us are hoping for happen incrementally. The Artist's Way, and these weekly check-ins, are useful ways to stop and notice those incremental changes. \nHow many days this week did you do your morning pages? How was the experience for you?",

          "description": "When our brilliant, inquisitive colleague Kelsey McKinney last participated in the Defector staff author interview series, she was here as a novelist. Her debut, God Spare The Girls, came out in 2021. In those pages, you can already sense her interest in rumors and secrets, the way they structure our communities. Six months later, she and Alex Sujong Laughlin dropped the first episode of Normal Gossip, the instant mega-hit podcast serving up “juicy, strange, funny, and utterly banal gossip about people you'll never know and never meet.” After seven seasons, Kelsey and Alex have left the show in the hands of an amazing new host-producer duo in Rachelle Hampton and Se'era Spragley Ricks, but Kelsey has distilled all the years she’s spent telling, listening to and thinking about gossip into a new book, You Didn’t Hear This From Me: (Mostly) True Notes On Gossip, which is out today.\n“At its most basic, gossip is just one person talking to another about someone who isn’t present,” Kelsey writes. She swallows up all these disparate categories of story—rumor, conspiracy, legend—and cleverly digests them. In some essays, she re-examines familiar places to see how gossip functions—in religious communities, on reality TV sets. In others, she’s concerned with the systems that accelerate gossip, like the norms of the internet and the anatomy of the ear. By the time you finish this book, you will have traveled in so many strange and enriching directions. Take this sampling from the \"D\" section of the index: defamation; Deuxmoi; Diana, Princess of Wales; Dickinson, Emily; Disney, Walt; Doja Cat; Donegan, Moira; dopamine; Dostoevsky, Fyodor; drag queen terminology.",

The benefit to the latter, who have seen the defending champs add a two-time Cy Young Award winner and a vaunted international free agent, among many others, is not hard to figure. Conspiracy types, for their part, can look at the Dodgers’ power moves and see the angle that MLB owners will play in their next attempt to finally install a salary cap. Their historic outlay for Shohei Ohtani a year ago made perfect sense because they just won the World Series; that they would continue trying to get better seems, to some, uncouth. In raising their tax payroll by $110 million in two years the Dodgers are now raising suspicions that they are cravenly buying up all the people there are in the game, and ruining baseball, and blah blah blah.\nWell, maybe, but what if all this is actually a move toward legitimizing the Dodgers' recent history? Even allowing for their dominance in the marketplace and their roll to victory in October, the Dodgers have not yet won a championship 1) in a complete season (they won the 2020 bubble title), or 2) while wearing actual major league uniforms since 1988.",

A direct-to-consumer pharmacy vaguely refers to inadequacies in the healthcare system—inadequacies you allay by buying its products. The Fox network advertises a new show in which Americans live out post-apocalyptic survivalist fantasies in the woods while their families watch them experience pain and suffering, which they can end at the cost of pulling from the game and ending their chance of winning a cash prize. An artificial intelligence firm positions its core product as the logical endpoint (and end) of human evolution. Every single other ad asks, Do you remember these celebrities? Do you know that they're doing a Super Bowl ad for you right now? The unified message I took away from the ads was that the time of new ideas is receding, and society along with it. The theme was the soft acceptance of a comfortable death.\nIf you can learn anything of value from a year's crop of Super Bowl commercials, it is not in the products being sold to you, but rather in how they are being sold. Think of an advertisement as a mirror: The way that mirror reflects and distorts a vision of reality, a reality that can be confirmed or avoided by purchasing the correct product, tells you both what the advertiser sees as vital or interesting about culture and what they think you want to see.",

It did clash with the maximalist Super Bowl graphics, but I will be happy if that’s the route Fox is going with next season.\nI will admit that it is at least a little bit sad that I care about this. Time to make things even sadder: I have one massive complaint about the Super Bowl graphics package, and I want to share it with you here. A few times per game football broadcasts will throw to the announcers in the booth, where they will deliver analysis, convey game storylines, or just yuk it up a bit on camera. With the game itself being a blowout pretty much straight through, last night's broadcast went to Kevin Burkhardt and Tom Brady multiple times.

A week after winning five Grammys for \"Not Like Us,\" it was pretty obvious that the smash hit was going to make an appearance, despite Drake's dogged attempts to sue damn near the entire music industry over the song. And Kendrick clearly had fun with that fact, repeatedly teasing the record at various points during the show until eventually performing it. At the song's telling moment, with a mischievous grin, Kendrick called out Drake right to camera before deftly declining to say the word \"pedophile\" on national TV.\n\"Not Like Us\" quickly transcended its original context within the beef, and has since become an anthem like The Killers' \"Mr. Brightside\" or The White Stripes' \"Seven Nation Army.\" It helps that its message is easily refashioned into a generalizable sentiment: THEY are not like US, whoever \"they\" or \"us\" might be. Kendrick himself has encouraged this broadening of the song's scope. \"Not like us is the energy of who I am, the type of man I represent,\" he said in an interview with SZA in Harper's Bazaar. \"This man has morals, he has values, he believes in something, he stands on something.

          "description": "Relying on Anthony Davis's availability is like setting foot on a rotted, rickety trapdoor and believing you'll be able to take another step. Beneath the trapdoor, in this analogy, is hell. Nico Harrison and Mavericks owner Patrick Dumont arranged it this way: By making it about a championship window, by calling their popular world-beating superstar an unreliable toxic fatso on his way out, by shrinking the period of observation down to the near term, the Mavericks all but announced This has to work right away. It became a piece of basketball wisdom so cheap and obvious that bothering to articulate it aloud had the ironic effect of making the speaker look somehow less knowledgeable about the sport: All of whatever they imagine makes Davis more valuable than Doncic to the present-day Mavericks relies upon Davis being upright. Davis does lots of things, many of them great and wonderful, but one of the things he does a lot is get hurt. And after not even three quarters of basketball in a Mavericks uniform, Davis got hurt.\nHe was playing very well Saturday, dominating the Houston Rockets and helping the Mavs to a 17-point halftime lead. Davis's skill and versatility popped immediately. He opened the game with a post touch against a positional mismatch, pulled in a help defender, scanned the court, and threw a perfect lob pass to Daniel Gafford for an alley-oop. Seconds later he swatted a layup from Alperen Sengun, gathered the rebound, led the break, and dished ahead to P.J. Washington for a transition dunk. Minutes later Davis dribbled the ball into the front court, sized up another mismatch, backed his defender into the paint, and turned over his shoulder for a calm jump hook. By halftime, Davis had 24 points, 13 rebounds, five assists, and three blocks, and the Mavericks had won his 21 minutes by a convincing 17 points. Harrison, who'd relinquished his seats in the arena due to the intensity of fan backlash, was for sure hearing the swelling music, if not the actual sounds of the game.",

Harold Carmichael, who would become a Hall of Famer, went in motion before the snap. He’d left too early. The play was called back, the Eagles punted, and three plays later Oakland Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett hit Kenny King for an 80-yard score. The Eagles lost the Super Bowl, 27-10.\nThat was Super Bowl 15, which was played in 1981, in New Orleans. I thought about that play during the first quarter of the Eagles’ absurd 40-22 blowout over the Chiefs last night in Super Bowl 59. I’d been thinking a lot about Super Bowl 15, the Eagles’ first and only previous New Orleans Super Bowl appearance. Never mind that it happened before I was born; oldheads in my neighborhood who had attended the game filled me in during my childhood. They talked about that Eagles Super Bowl trip as if they’d made a medieval pilgrimage to the Abbey of Saint Gall (patron saint of birds). They also complained about the penalty, still, a decade-plus after the fact. It was bullshit, they’d say, not pausing to apologize for the word. They believed that the Eagles could’ve won if they’d just been able to tie the game at 7 there.",

Pressured on 38 percent of his snaps, Mahomes was hit 11 times, sacked six times, forced into a pair of picks, and fumbled the ball away once. In one of the more stunning stats in NFL history, the Eagles did all that without blitzing a single time. That trickles down—because they never had to send help, Philadelphia was able to stay in Cover 4 all game long, cutting off deep balls and quickly smothering anything underneath. \"In order to make a team blitz, you have to be able to beat what they're showing.\" Mahomes said.\" And that's what we didn't do.\" \nPatrick Smith/Getty Images",

It was the last thing they controlled the entire evening.\nThe team that rope-a-doped their way to almost incandescent glory in 2024 instead found out that, sometimes, you just can't slip the punch. It wasn't the third-time's-not-the-charm jinx that did them in, it was the Philadelphia Eagles. And more decisively, it was the Eagles with only some Saquon Barkley, an entirely different M.O. That meant the Chiefs weren't undone by a single player but a smothering collective impervious to even Patrick Mahomes's multileveled sorceries. The final score of 40-22 grossly flattered the Chiefs and barely explained Philadelphia's dominance. It's as if the \"GAME OVER\" legend at the end of Kendrick Lamar's halftime show had been frantically cobbled together after Zack Baun's second quarter interception.",

He would have bunny-hopped across an eight-lane highway for Bucks 135, Sixers 127 because for him—the last true basketball lifer—it wasn't the 135 or the 127 that moved him. It was the Bucks and Sixers part, and it would have been the same had he been given Pistons 112, Hornets 102, or Rockets 94, Raptors 87, or even anything involving the freshly re-deadified Wizards. Hubie was there unapologetically for The Game before him and only The Game before him. If you would have preferred Rockets-Raptors because it featured 81 points of better defense, you would have been wrong because every games was equal in his eyes— a chance to explain what was before him to people wanting to learn.\nHubie Brown is 91, and he looked and sounded every day of it 20 years ago when his coaching career ended. He coached somewhere for 30-some-odd years (even Wikipedia doesn't have firm dates for two of his high school jobs) and broadcasted somewhere for 29. He coached forever the same way, and he told the stories of the game the same way. He knew what he believed to be important, and walked and talked with that central precept for the entirety of his public life. He did it for so long and so unabashedly his way that he managed, somehow, to never fall out of fashion while anyone who came after him trying it Hubie's way was out of fashion immediately. The closest anyone came to doing Hubie was the much younger but no less self-assured JJ Redick, and he got in two years and change before he was hired to Hubie-up the Los Angeles Lakers.",

And if you can't be weird in Louisiana, well, what exactly is the point?\nWhen your biggest moment of the week, after all, is Roger Goodell leaning hard into an 18th game, you have a serious cultural dud on your hands. The football will be the football, of course, and as matchups go Eagles-Chiefs is not far from the best you can do. But New Orleans might be the last bastion of the pre-corporate days when the town created the atmosphere and it was up to the visitors to keep up. This time, the weirdest thing we got will be something we have to conjure in our own minds—the big game with a sitting President (Uncle Dismal) and a potential rival in 2028 (Stephen A. Smith). Neither is qualified to do the job, as one has proven and the other certainly would if given the chance, but the moment Smith's name appeared on a poll listing potential Democratic candidates and garnering 2 percent, we took an irrevocable turn toward a world in which Prince Andrew seems leaderly.
