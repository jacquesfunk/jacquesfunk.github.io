I find this way of thinking to be incorrect because I like Gerrit Cole, though in a way that's not always contingent on his continued success. He's a guy with a dad comportment who is very invested in labor and the MLB Players Association. He's one of the best pitchers of his generation. He is often one of the most informative pitchers to listen to talk after a start, especially a poor one. He sounds a bit like Kermit the Frog? His 2021 spider tack era proved so fascinating to me that I got in the graph mines for my own satisfaction.\nThis is not to say that I don't derive joy from his successful starts, it's just that it is not the only part of what defines a satisfying Cole game. To me, he remains narratively interesting as a hyper-competitive guy who has gone through ups and downs in recent years. It's hard to begrudge anyone their disaffection—he can be a bit of a heel on the field, but he's a well-constructed one who's generally chill off of it, and, most importantly, has a fatal flaw: Rafael Devers.",

Baku was Leclerc's race to lose on Sunday, and lose it he did, though not through the traditional Ferrari methodology of engine explosions, egregious strategy calls, or things of that nature. The race was a war of attrition that was, somehow, still won by the first pit stop.\nBut for all the pre-race chitter chatter about McLaren favoring Norris in team orders, a disastrous qualifying performance meant that Norris's chances at a win were infinitesimally low. Instead, it was his teammate, Oscar Piastri, who started P2. Leclerc pulled off the line cleanly, and quickly built a six-second gap to Piastri. But with the medium tires degrading quickly, the undercut became extremely powerful. Sergio Pérez—who, in spite of a horrible 2024, could be a zombie and still get a podium finish at Baku—was the earliest frontrunner to pit. He came out just behind Norris, who started P15 and was accordingly running a different strategy.",

          "description": "Cinema tells us that when a batter steps into the box and the catcher proceeds to tell him which pitch is coming, the catcher may be doing this for one of many reasons. It might have nothing to do with the batter; the catcher could be teaching his hotshot flamethrower not to shake off his elders. It might have everything to do with the batter; perhaps he is Michael Jordan. Some pitches are so good they can be fired past anyone, even a slugger who knows what's on the way. \nA new report from ESPN's Jeff Passan and Kiley McDaniel says none of these can explain a recent game between the Lakeland Flying Tigers and the Fort Myers Mighty Mussels, Low-A affiliates of the Tigers and Twins. In the second game of a Sept. 6 doubleheader, one the Mighty Mussels needed to win to stay in the Florida State League playoff race, Flying Tigers batters were puzzled to hear 21-year-old Mussels catcher Derek Bender telling them which pitches starter Ross Dunn was about to throw.",

The Pacific 12 Conference, which began as the Pac 8 then went to a membership of 10, and then 12, and then worryingly down to two, is now back up to six, only five of which cannot see the ocean after which the conference is named. As a result of that conference’s raid on its own ranks, the Mountain West is now slightly less mountainous and notably less western. If all pundit-based guesstimates are right it will be even less of both by Hallowe'en. \nBecause this is American athletic culture in the third decade of the 2000s, it both fits and is essential that one of those candidates for re-re-re-location is based in, wait for it, Las Vegas.",

Visiting their website, I felt like I’d stumbled across a standard conservation group, or maybe a slightly pretentious yoga studio. There were pleasant, neutral-colored serif fonts, a looping video of moss and trees and sunlight breaking through a forest canopy and people happily trudging through the undergrowth in slow motion.

Instead he lunged forward, his helmet making contact with Damar Hamlin's forearm, and then banging the back of his head on the turf. A normal football play. But normal football plays involve very strong men moving very fast, and Tagovailoa's brain, having suffered officially three previous concussions and in reality more than that, is especially susceptible to another one. \nThere was a time not all that long ago, when I started blogging, when I'd need to explain the fencing response: what it is, what it means. Not anymore. Football fans have seen it too many times—we've seen him do it too many times—while somber broadcasters cut to a commercial as the network's minor-key injury music plays. Tagovailoa instantly performed the fencing response after being tackled, and no one needed further explanation. Not again.",
