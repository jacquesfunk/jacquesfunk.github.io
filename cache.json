          "description": "Being an NFL Draft nerd is fun but pessimistic work. It begins with the idea that most of the cool things you see happening in Baton Rouge or Columbus on Saturday are not things that ever can or will happen on Sunday. That isn’t an unreasonable way to go about eating tape: A perfectly blocked run in college football ends with a house call; a perfectly blocked run in the NFL probably means it’s second-and-6. But sometimes, in all the skepticism, you lose sight of the good stuff, especially so with guys like Jayden Daniels, who was mostly a pile of subordinate clauses in my mind before he ever made an NFL start. But he gets cartoonishly lit up all the time! But his pressure-to-sack ratio! But his age! I forget that there's supposed to be something on the first end of the sentence. \nHere are some complete and completely crazy sentences: The Washington Commanders offense works on Sundays. They are an absolute pleasure to watch. I believe they are going to score every time they take the field. Through the first four weeks of the season, no NFL offense was better at keeping drives alive. Against the Browns on Sunday—actually an iffy offensive performance by their own recent standards—the Commanders still dominated, 34-13. For the third straight week, they put up 30 or more points, and they did it this time against Cleveland's legit defense. (It didn't hurt that the Browns offense asks the defense to spend roughly 90 percent of each game on the field.) That Daniels had the worst game of his pro career, recorded his lowest completion percentage, and was pulled after the third quarter in Week 5 probably would not register as a concern to anyone familiar with the Commanders and their deal, historically speaking. That the rookie QB spent the entire fourth quarter on the bench because the Commanders led the Browns, 34-6, is an altogether different story.",

          "description": "After Jürgen Klopp departed Liverpool at the end of last season, new boss Arne Slot was faced with a doubly difficult task. Like any recently hired manager, he had to acclimate to a new club and a new set of players. What's more, he had to do all that under the colossal shadow of one of Liverpool's most beloved managers in its storied history. Even the most optimistic of Liverpool fans probably expected a slow, wonky start to the transition. Slot came into a great situation, about as good as any new manager could hope for, but it was still new, and the pressure would ramp up quickly.\nA funny thing has happened two months into this season, though: Liverpool has not only been just as good as it was last season, it might even be better. At minimum, the Pool Boys haven't skipped a single beat, rolling out to eight wins in nine matches so far. That start has seen Liverpool top the Premier League table, win both of its two Champions League matches, and begin its League Cup title defense by trouncing West Ham. The only blemish came against a feisty Nottingham Forest on Sept. 14.",

          "description": "There are so many plucky Teams of Destiny in this year's playoffs that it's hard to pick just one to win the World Series off the back of narrative power. But the San Diego Padres have one too many legitimately good players to qualify, and the Detroit Tigers lost their first game of the Division Series, so the odds, depending on how you're counting, might favor the alternately Francisco Lindor- and \"OMG\"-powered New York Mets.\nIt is never a detriment to be the overdog in a series, but a favored team will never have the whimsy inherent to a team that should be losing. The core of the Philadelphia Phillies this year remains the same core that fueled the himbo-led, \"Oh dear God, please would you stop blogging about the\" Phillies of 2022 and 2023; going down the rosters of each year reveals no real pivotal trades or signings that would explain in baseball terms how the atmosphere around the Phillies has changed so drastically. And yet the Phillies started out this year as the best team in baseball and ended the year not so far off the mark. Any reasonable fan would rather have a team like that over a team that pluckily plucks its way into the playoffs every so often. But something—even if just the illusion of zen—is lost in trading magic for expectation. There's no danger of collapse for the team that is just having fun out there, and no freedom from that danger for the team whose whole season will count as a failure if it doesn't advance.",

As such, he was overcome with excitement. \"I have to show everyone,\" he remembers thinking.\nAt a glance, the bodies of ctenophores, which are also called comb jellies, are shaped simply, like ovals. They have a mouth at one end and a concentrated sensory system called an apical organ at their rear. The small region of the apical organ contains \"a photoreceptor or gravity receptor and some pressure receptor or chemical receptor,\" said Jokura, who is a ctenophore biologist at the National Institutes of Natural Sciences in Okazaki, Japan.",

And these are in no particular order; your own emotional mileage may vary.\nThey were also the decidedly lowjinks of Dolphins-Patriots, all three turgid hours of it, and the disaster that is Jets general manager Aaron Rodgers; Davante Adams in a stasis loop while the Raiders try to figure out the worst place to trade him; the NFL's new speed-concussion policy as it pertained to Justin Fields and Josh Allen (hint: their heads are still attached, so they're ready to go); the first inning of Tigers-Guardians; the megadisaster that is the Trent Dilfer apology/experiment at Alabama-Birmingham; and most depressingly the lightning storm in Pittsburgh that delayed Cowboys-Steelers but did not strike Elon Musk when he was right there for the frying.",

The answers are not necessarily surprising. Trump often takes the stage more than an hour late, and in his current state of diminishment his speeches are mostly a matter of him maundering, salty and glum and increasingly damp, through a free-associative list of half-remembered cable news gripes. Some of the people the Post spoke to left because they were sick of \"the insults,\" which feels a bit like storming out of a steakhouse dinner just before dessert because you don't eat meat.

          "description": "If you take the New York Jets aspect out of the thing, and then further strip a bunch of really crucial context from it, it is easy to see how Jets fans might have been optimistic about this season. The roster is as talented as any Jets team in recent memory, with the crew of Emotional Support Teammates that the team furnished Aaron Rodgers with last season mostly turned over in favor of more obviously NFL-grade contributors; Rodgers himself is as healthy as any 40-year-old NFL quarterback could be, which does not necessarily rise to the level of physical wellness traditionally associated with the word \"healthy\" but has mostly allowed him to stay on the field and intermittently do Aaron Rodgers-style football stuff; the defense, while depleted after some typically avant-garde front office maneuvering during the offseason, has the personnel to be good. In the abstract, the Jets are the sort of team that even reasonable fans could talk themselves into. In another, much more urgent, literal, and less abstracted sense, they remain the New York Jets.\nThat the Jets found a way to lose to the Minnesota Vikings in London on Sunday is less surprising with that in mind. The defense played its second straight excellent game, stymieing a Vikings offense that had been one of the NFL's best and effectively turning Sam Darnold back into the forlorn figure he was during his tenure with the Jets. But that Jetsian aura, a fragrant greenish fug in which all Jets games have been played for roughly the last decade and a half, affects everyone on the field. And on Sunday, even as the Jets defense succeeded in turning the game at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium into the unloveliest possible demonstration of American football, Aaron Rodgers was absolutely lost in it.",

          "description": "Round up a little, and Diego Pavia might well be six feet tall, his generously listed height. Before he transferred to Vanderbilt, he played at New Mexico State, and before that at the New Mexico Military Institute, where he committed out of high school as a two-star recruit. If there was any hint of what was to come, of the wild self-belief required to lead an upset of the No. 1 team in the country, it was that Pavia arrived in Nashville with a suspiciously rich lore. See: the no-look pass he once threw because his helmet was on completely backwards; the in-state rivalry taken so far it ended with an Albuquerque Journal story headlined “NMSU coach ‘disappointed’ in Diego Pavia after urination video”; the wrestling move he once tried on an Auburn defensive back, the only time I can remember a quarterback being called for unnecessary roughness. In that context and perhaps only in that context, Saturday’s Alabama-Vanderbilt game, a 40-35 Vandy win and maybe the biggest upset in SEC history, makes perfect sense. \nPavia had plenty of things to say after the win; unfortunately for the SEC Network standards and practices department, about 40 percent of it would need to be bleeped out later. (“Vandy, we’re fucking turnt!” he shouted into the mic, moments after explaining that God had given him a vision of this as a little kid.) In the stadium postgame, Vanderbilt looped a quote from Nick Saban over the PA. Two weeks ago on the Pat McAfee show, the former Alabama coach said, “The only place you play in the SEC that’s not hard to play is Vanderbilt.”",

          "description": "The moment at which an astute but otherwise objective observer might have begun getting suspicious about whether something might be going on with the New York Mets would probably have been late June. This was when it came out that the team had adopted as a clubhouse anthem the song that a reserve infielder had recorded in his home studio about being grateful and having a nice time. I can only guess at that perspective in this case, but take your own fan investments out of it and run this exercise through yourself. \nIf you learned that, after wins, the baseball team you cared about was shouting along to the chorus of a song that the resident thirtysomething utility spork had recorded in his spare time—it could be Kevin Newman or Donovan Solano or whoever you like, in whatever genre you find most amusing to imagine—there would be in that news the sense that the good kind of weird thing was happening in that clubhouse. Any team that signed Jose Iglesias to a minor league deal, installed him as an everyday player out of necessity and watched him have the best season of his career at the age of 34, adopted his song, and then won nearly two out of every three games for four months would have some sense of destiny about it. It's simply too stupid not to mean something. The challenge has been believing that this could happen, and then accepting that it was indeed happening, to the New York Mets.",

          "description": "David Foster Wallace had a thing for boredom. He had such a thing for it that he turned it into a kind of last legacy. According to a lengthy (and pretty great) piece in The New Yorker by D.T. Max published a year after Wallace died by suicide in 2008, he left behind a third of his final novel, The Pale King, for which he had spent countless hours researching boredom. A typed note he also left behind laid out the book’s central intention: “Bliss—a-second-by-second joy and gratitude at the gift of being alive, conscious—lies on the other side of crushing, crushing boredom. Pay close attention to the most tedious thing you can find (Tax Returns, Televised Golf) and, in waves, a boredom like you’ve never known will wash over you and just about kill you. Ride these out, and it’s like stepping from black and white into color. Like water after days in the desert. Instant bliss in every atom.” \nThis interest of Wallace’s has been closely connected to mindfulness, but the two things are a little different. Mindfulness is an awareness of things as they come, it is a kind of riding out, but that’s not exactly bliss you find through it so much as a kind of acceptance—which, to a person in constant distress, can no doubt, relatively speaking, feel like bliss. “Pay close attention to the most tedious thing you can find.” I didn’t realize this would be Joker: Folie à Deux.",

The game came to a halt in the middle of the sixth and final inning, when the NWLL first baseman picked up the game ball on his way to his position, prompting the home plate umpire to loudly declare that the first baseman now had to pitch. With NWLL up 6-0 and three outs away from advancing, manager Mike Klisch walked onto the field and spent several minutes conferring with the umpire. The first baseman had already pitched the first four innings before being relieved, so he was likely ineligible to return to the mound. It took a phone call from the ump to Little League headquarters to untangle the rules. \n“Is there a 24-hour line to answer questions about rules?” an NWLL mother in the crowd asked as the game resumed.",

The Houston Astros' seven-year streak of reaching the ALCS ended the same night that the Atlanta Braves' six-year streak of reaching the NLDS did the same, and each in an unceremonious sweep—at least, as much as a sweep can be a sweep in a three-game postseason series. At the very least, the Milwaukee Brewers spared us an extra day without any postseason baseball by forcing a Game 3 against the Mets.\nNo sensible person will cry about these developments. The Astros are the Astros, and the Braves were a dead team walking even entering the playoffs; better they just be put out of their misery. Other than the overarching sentiment towards both teams' failings, conflating them is a bit misleading. The postseason record that the Astros strung together might be distasteful, but has to garner some level of respect: No other team has managed it. Meanwhile, \"reaching the NLDS\" can sound impressive when phrased that way, but even in the expanded playoffs, half the teams that reach a Divisional Series do it through the regular season.",
