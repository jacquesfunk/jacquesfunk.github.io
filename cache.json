As the only remaining player from that squad, she told Sandra Herrera that she’s asked herself, “Why? Why am I still looking to do something special here?”\nThe journey hasn’t been an easy one. The Pride had only made the playoffs once before this year, back in Marta’s first season in 2017. Despite star-laden squads led by the likes of Alex Morgan, Ali Krieger, Sydney Leroux, Ali Riley, and Marta herself, Orlando never could quite form a team greater than the sum of its most impressive parts. Until this season, that is, when Marta, Orlando, and maybe even the NWSL as a whole all found the success they’d long been working for.",

          "description": "Max Verstappen claimed his fourth consecutive championship Saturday night, at the conclusion of the Las Vegas Grand Prix. Verstappen came into the race 62 points clear of Lando Norris with three races to go; some truly improbable stuff would've needed to happen over the season's remaining few weeks for Norris to complete the overtake, but at a minimum the McLaren driver needed to finish ahead of Verstappen in Vegas. He could not. Verstappen cruised home in sixth place, half a minute ahead of seventh-place Norris, who surrendered late and took an extra pit stop in order to pursue the point for fastest lap on fresh soft tires, his McLaren team having shifted its attention to holding off Ferrari in the constructor standings.\nIt was a somewhat anticlimactic conclusion to a championship chase that juiced up the middle third of a Formula 1 season that in its early stages looked like another dreary Red Bull cakewalk. Even as the McLaren plot-line fizzled and it became clear into autumn that Norris's title hopes rested upon Verstappen's car kerploding at some point and then continuing to kerplode on an almost weekly basis, there was still fun to be had in Red Bull's mounting frustration and increasingly visible dysfunction. Then Verstappen had one of the most impressive races of his career in a soaked and chaotic São Paolo Grand Prix, releasing a lot of pressurized angst and giving his inevitable fourth championship its signature moment. São Paolo at least delivered the thrills, even if it all but ended the underdog charge that gave the season its flavor. A Norris win in Las Vegas would've prolonged the chase, but not for very long.",

          "description": "Some human bodies are not meant to endure a full 82-game NBA regular season. It's not necessarily the marker of doom it may seem. Bill Walton never could, and he won an MVP award, a Finals MVP award, two titles, and made the Hall of Fame. Tracy McGrady, a fellow Hall-of-Famer, never suited up for 82 games in any of his 16 NBA seasons. Joel Embiid, with two scoring titles and an MVP under his belt at age 30, hasn't yet managed it, and almost certainly never will. You can be a great player without ever exactly being an every-night player. Zion Williamson can still be great.\nThat's the thing I keep repeating to myself, in the manner of one who recites comforting air-travel safety statistics immediately after having watched both of his plane's wings shear off at 39,000 feet, when I read that Williamson's latest leg injury has not responded as hoped to \"multiple treatments\" and that he is \"not close to a return to action.\" Williamson started the season with a sore left leg, and then on Nov. 6 he tweaked his hamstring. He returned on Nov. 9 and played well in a loss. Williamson says he \"felt fine\" after this game, but during treatment the next day he felt \"more sore here than usual,\" and was told after a checkup that he'd suffered a strain and would be ruled out indefinitely. It's been two weeks, and now someone wants Shams to spread the word that fans should not expect Zion to return to the court anytime soon, despite several different attempts having been made at healing that hamstring.",

And sometimes it can be deduced from the mere presence of Rudy Gobert, a man so unpopular among his colleagues that ESPN tried to learn why at feature length. Even as the team around him has changed, Gobert is still Gobert, with charisma about as strong as his low-post repertoire.\nThis offseason's trade between the Knicks and Wolves was, in some ways, trading like for like. One offensively gifted, sporadically infuriating big man was swapped for another, Julius Randle to Minnesota and Karl-Anthony Towns to New York. All things considered, the Towns-Gobert pairing was a pretty successful experiment, schematically and interpersonally. But Randle is a bit more dour than the man he was replacing. Gobert-Randle had tremendous grump-on-grump potential, and we're starting to see it, eight wins and seven losses into a Wolves campaign against a very soft slate of opponents.",

In other words, he's messing around with the All-Star Game.\nCredit to him for trying, anyway. Silver is nothing if not persistent, and at his pay grade as commissioner of your National Basketball Association, he'd damned well better be. He is already being given credit for the largely illusory benefits of the in-season tournament, which is mostly just a tribute to schedule manipulation (good games between good teams are always that, Emirates branding be damned), some gym floor murals by 12-year-olds with an unlimited supply of spray paint, and a trophy nobody has any particular attachment to. But Silver does understand that customers will buy anything they can be fooled into thinking is worth the attention span. The challenge, where the All-Star Game is concerned, is that no one is fooled.",

That being said, I do regret the fact that it's recently become a lot harder to keep up with the international game stateside.\nFor a couple years now I've spent most midseason international breaks spotting tasty UEFA Nations League matchups and CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifiers on the schedule, only to learn that watching them would require expanding my already bloated streaming service subscriptions to divorce-threatening levels. I'm about as motivated a soccer fan as there is, and yet even I refuse to stump up for the Fubos and Vixes and Fox Soccer Pluses of the world, especially when you can't even rely on those services to air every match in the competitions they have the rights to. It's gotten to the point where I've now all but given up even thinking about catching non-tournament national team games.",

First, there were eight years in development hell, easily enough to kill most films. Then there was a pandemic. Nearly a decade had passed since the initial announcement by the time Jon M. Chu took over as director in 2021, fresh off In The Heights and Crazy Rich Asians. By the end of the year, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande were cast as the green and pink protagonists, respectively. In April 2022, Chu posted a note sent from his “OzPhone” on Twitter that read, in part, “As we prepared the production over the last year, it became impossible to wrestle the story of 'Wicked' into a single film without doing some real damage to it\":\nAs we tried to cut songs or trim characters, those decisions began to feel like fatal compromises to the source material that has entertained us all for so many years. We decided to give ourselves a bigger canvas and make not just one 'Wicked' movie but two! With more space, we can tell the story of 'Wicked' as it was meant to be told while bringing even more depth and surprise to the journeys for these beloved characters.",

A single day of my life became the intermission. Everyone thinks their dreams are interesting. We are self-involved creatures, infatuated with the shiny pictures our subconscious makes for us and presents like a movie in the mere seconds before our brains return to the living. But the week before the election, my subconscious gave me something special. \nIn the dream, the moon was shrinking. I was staring up at the sky while it swirled around and around, becoming smaller and smaller, orbiting around nothing, counterclockwise in an oval like it was going around a race track. And just when it became too small to really see, it became larger and larger and larger and larger. It was coming toward us, falling, plummeting into the Earth's atmosphere. And then I woke up. The whole next day, I read about the moon. I researched what would happen if the moon fell (we would all die). I tried to understand how big the moon actually is (very big). Of course, it returned to my dreams the next night. In the sequel, the moon was lost. The moon had plummeted into the Pacific Ocean, and we could not find it. In the dream, I watched videos on my phone, desperate to try and understand what had happened here: videos from the ISS, of the news, or of crews searching the Pacific.",

This was the level of youth sports where you’re essentially dressing up as an athlete without being one yet.

When he was a boy wonder at Borussia Dortmund, it was by scoring a ton of goals in the U.S.'s failed efforts to qualify for the 2018 World Cup that he introduced himself to the country and legitimized himself as more than just the next Julian Green. When he was alternating between sitting on the Chelsea bench due to injuries and sitting on the Chelsea bench because he'd slipped down the pecking order, getting to come and bang in CONCACAF was a way to rebuild his confidence. And now that he's in the form of his life for AC Milan, rounding into his prime by playing a huge role for a team competing for domestic and continental honors, his play with the USMNT feels equally expansive and ambitious. This is the best Christian Pulisic we've ever seen, a prospect that is equal parts encouraging and annoying.\nThe headlining event came in Monday night's huge win against Jamaica—where Captain America grabbed two goals in a thrilling 4-2 victory—though Pulisic built the foundation for that big performance by killing it for Milan all season. With Rafael Leão holding down Pulisic's preferred left wing position, the American has split his time in Italy this season between setting things up as a central attacking midfielder and ripping down the right wing. And rip he has: Pulisic leads Milan in Serie A goals and assists, and he's scored against Liverpool and gotten an assist against Real Madrid in the Champion's League. Milan has been slightly off the pace in Serie A this year, mostly because their backline has been somewhat wobbly and the new coach wasn't getting along with Leão, the club's best player. Throughout it all, though, Pulisic has been flying.",
