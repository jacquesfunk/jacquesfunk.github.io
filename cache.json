          "description": "The Washington Nationals made a sudden and alarming roster move on Friday, optioning 23-year-old all-star shortstop C.J. Abrams to their Triple-A team in Rochester. If the Nationals were good—if they were overstocked with primo young hitting talent, like, say, the Baltimore Orioles—it would be possible to slide this move by as an unfortunate consequence of roster crunch. And, indeed, the Orioles also optioned a talented youngster on the same day, sending hulking 22-year-old infielder and reigning organizational Minor League Player of the Year Coby Mayo back to Norfolk, effectively ending his season. Good teams can have reasons for making painful late-season roster moves that are, if not entirely wholesome, at least coherent within the context of a competitive enterprise. This is not that.\nThe Nationals are not good, and there's no one anywhere in the organization to slide all that comfortably into Abrams's spot in the field or in the lineup. Abrams's demotion is a disciplinary measure: As first reported by Cody Delmendo of CHGO Sports and later confirmed by Jesse Rogers of ESPN, Abrams was seen living it up at a Chicago casino until 8:00 a.m. Friday morning, and then had to suit up for a 2:00 p.m. game against the Cubs that same afternoon. After the game—Abrams went 0-for-3 with a walk in the leadoff spot, in a 3–1 loss—Nationals coach Davey Martinez pulled Abrams into a long and emotional meeting and informed him that his season was over. The Nationals haven't exactly ratted Abrams out, but everything in their tone and demeanor confirms the scoop.",

So trusting. So naive. But these are the Raiders, who have talked it while steadfastly refusing to walk it for two full decades and change now.

Do you know how to use sphagnum moss to treat a wound after an unfortunate ax misadventure? If a crafty vole has raided your stores of fish, will you be able to find more food or resort to gnarly bark-based teas and intermittent fasting as the frost sets in?\nIt's a manufactured danger. But part of the appeal is that there's no one coming to the rescue. Ultimately you survive and win, or wind up another sucker ferried back to civilization after an intense flirtation with giardia. Either way, these people have to figure out a new way to live every day.",

          "description": "In the Premier League's marquee showdown of the weekend, last year's number one and number two faced off in an early clash of titans that already had title implications. Arsenal retooled this summer in order to better pursue Manchester City for a third straight season, bringing in defender Riccardo Calafiori, midfielder Mikel Merino, and forward Raheem Sterling. Sunday was Arsenal's first crack at City this season, and though the visiting side gave up a goal to—who else—Erling Haaland in the ninth minute, the Gunners took control of the match with goals from two defenders: Calafiori tied it up in the 22nd with an incredible rocket from outside the box, and then Gabriel gave Arsenal the lead in the first minute of first half stoppage time with a rising header off a corner.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4eXMyqrGVg",

Correspondingly, there was tired, occasionally frustrated driving on a street circuit not built for overtakes, though this year they tried to rectify this issue by increasing the total number of DRS zones to four. Four! The saving grace for Singapore has also been its most defining characteristic: its propensity for safety cars. But this year, with some luck and a lot of engine reliability, there was nothing. \nThis year's race was won or lost in discrete moments. Ferrari lost it after a horrific qualifying; you can't recover from P9 and P10 on the grid on a track like Singapore. Lewis Hamilton lost it after a call to put him on old soft tires to start the race; he failed to grab the all-important track position on the opening lap, and didn't have the tires to last him to the end. And Lando Norris won it by finally converting pole position to a lap-one lead for the first time so far this season, putting to bed—or, at least, a nap—one of the most persistent criticisms levied at his driving this year.",

While influencers work to persuade their audience to buy products they may or may not need in the hopes of getting a few cents of commission, de-influencers remind people why they don’t need to spend their money. De-influencing material ranges from explaining why individual viral products aren't worth buying to entire accounts built to remind audiences that hauls aren't normal and call out undisclosed ads or partnerships with brands. De-influencing is part of a larger populist turn I've noticed in response to the omnipresent commercialization of the social internet, but it also exemplifies one of the internet's signal conundrums: Is it possible to create anticapitalist work on social media?",

That's 120 days of feeling bad at the ballpark; 120 unsatisfied nights, wishing for a better tomorrow that rarely comes. Thirty-six chances for the South Side to stand up, weighed against 120 blunt remonstrances to remain seated.\nThe 43-119 Detroit Tigers of 2003 are now in the rearview mirror, still notable for possessing the last 20-game loser in Mike Maroth but no longer for owning the AL's worst record of the modern era. The 40-120-1 New York Mets of 1962 are next up. One of the first expansion teams, before MLB had balanced its expansion rules to avoid putting out true stinkers, those Mets were wretched but charmingly pitiable, like an Instagram chihuahua. They made their own manager ask, \"Can't anybody here play this game?\" They were and are baseball's touchstone for terrible. And they were a better team than the 2024 Chicago White Sox.",

They were leading 18-9, having held the Aces to just 11 percent shooting from the field. Unanimous MVP A'ja Wilson, who had just received her trophy in a pregame ceremony, was 1-of-8. The Storm were cooking.\nIf a blueprint exists for Seattle getting past Vegas in this best-of-three first-round matchup, it looks a lot like what happened in that first quarter. The Storm, always a defense-first unit, were playing with an intensity and speed that totally discombobulated the Aces' offense. Even without defensive anchor Ezi Magbegor, Seattle's collection of defensive hawks were switching and sliding and blitzing fast enough to make Wilson and the Aces look slow and ponderous. Every shot at the rim was contested, and Seattle's traps and rotations fired so quickly that they looked less like a basketball team scrambling to cover the court than a well-drilled soccer team executing a perfect counter-press.",

The birds had three blown fourth downs early in the game: a blocked punt, a Jalen Hurts sack after a too many men on the field penalty, and a busted run play at the end of the first half in place of an easy field goal.",

James Madison forced four turnovers, including a pick-six and a blocked punt return for a touchdown in just the first half. The Dukes notched five turnovers in total and for added measure—or humiliation—recovered their own surprise onside kick.

In 2019, Dolan sold the team to Joseph and Clara Wu Tsai, who moved the Liberty to Brooklyn in 2021.

Afterward, one of her coaches, Cecile Landi, challenged her score.

Nuzzi told Darcy after his story broke that \"earlier this year, the nature of some communication\" between herself and a subject \"turned personal.\" She said the relationship was \"never physical but should have been disclosed to prevent the appearance of a conflict.\" In a note to New York staff, editor David Haskell said Nuzzi, 31, claimed not to have used Kennedy, 70, as a source during their relationship, which started in December 2023 and ended in August.

The band began as a solo project for Spencer Krug's bedroom recordings, and expanded into one of the weirdest, densest, most essential bands of the late 2000s. As one of Wolf Parade's vocalists and creative forces, Krug was already building some buzz for himself as a vital voice in the burgeoning indie rock moment, but he had too many ideas for even that once-prolific band. That's where Sunset Rubdown came in.\nFollowing the project's solo and lo-fi debut album, 2005's Snake's Got A Leg, the band released as strong a trilogy of albums as any act to come out of the music-blog era. Shut Up I Am Dreaming, from 2006, was the breakout, landing on year-end best-of lists, thanks to its simultaneously glittering, brooding, and claustrophobic sound, and its expansive instrument collages. As an aside, this is where I hopped aboard the Sunset Rubdown train, having heard the album shortly into my first semester of college a year after its release. For someone only just starting to broaden his musical horizons, Shut Up I Am Dreaming was a sledgehammer to the brain. (I mean that as a compliment.)",

It was the longest-running Catholic high-school rivalry in the country. They played every Thanksgiving morning at Fitton Field, the home ground of the Holy Cross Crusaders, about whom more anon.\nThe two schools had stood as monuments to the massive Irish diaspora to Worcester of which my family was a part. I went to St. Peter’s for elementary school and to St. John’s for high school. St. John’s moved to the suburbs in 1959, which turned out to be a fateful move for both schools and fatal for their rivalry. St. Peter’s stayed in Worcester, but it merged with a girls’ high school and became St. Peter-Marian. St. John’s gradually grew beyond St. Peter’s in every way, including in its football program. The two schools ended the rivalry with their 95th meeting in 2019. St. John’s won, 35-12.",

This year, a one-way year as he recovers from Tommy John surgery, he just up and decided to double his previous stolen base high, because I guess he was bored not pitching. Sure, why not. Next year he might play goal for the Kings. It feels just as realistic. He makes baseball seem like a matter of willpower. If you can dream it, he might do it, and he might do the undreamt too. The 50/50 club—50 home runs, 50 stolen bases—was not a thing. No one was in it. Those are two very different skills, and guys who hit for power don't tend to run well, and vice versa. Whatever. Ohtani did it. I think he can do anything.\nExcept be patient, perhaps. When he joined the 40/40 club last month, 21 games faster than anyone had ever done so, he said he felt relief, as all the pending pomp was getting in the way of the thing he really wants to do: step into the box and hit the dang ball. “It was something I wanted to get over as soon as possible because the balls were being exchanged every time I was up to bat,\" he said.",
