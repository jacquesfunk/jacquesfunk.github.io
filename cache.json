The defense harried quarterback Patrick Mahomes, and after halftime the offense put together a 10-minute drive to score a touchdown to put the score within one. Ultimately, none of this mattered. Houston would have lost by double digits on Saturday if not for an intentional safety by the Chiefs at the end of their 23-14 divisional-round victory, sending them to a seventh straight AFC title game.\nNeither team lost a fumble or threw an interception, but the Texans still made a few costly mistakes. Kansas City's Nikko Remigio returned the opening kick 63 yards, and afterward Houston's Kris Boyd was flagged for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, giving the Chiefs a red-zone appearance within 13 seconds of the game. The normally reliable Texans kicker Ka'imi Fairbairn missed an extra point and a 55-yard field goal try, and had another FG attempt blocked. Houston seemed to be facing a second opponent in the play clock, and on one occasion, a rushed fourth-and-10 call was doomed before it could really develop, resulting in a 16-yard sack of Texans QB C.J. Stroud. Early in the first quarter, he came up limping after a run, and he became easier to hit. Stroud threw for 245 yards as he absorbed eight total sacks.",

          "description": "Across the entire spectrum of great American icons, there is no one quite like David Lynch. He was a walking enigma: an artist’s artist who was also somehow mainstream, an unapologetic esotericist whose work still managed to be immediately though ineffably understood, a well-known and highly regarded director who was nevertheless completely underrated. He’s arguably the most influential filmmaker of the last 50 years, and though many have tried, no one has been able to walk down the lane he invented with 1977's Eraserhead.\nLynch died on Thursday at the age of 78. He had recently been suffering from emphysema due to complications from COVID, which kept him homebound. It's another blow for Los Angeles in a grim month, since, along with being one of our great filmmakers, he was one of those luminary chroniclers of LA, on par with Joan Didion, Mike Davis, John Singleton, and Tupac. From his trilogy of LA films (Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, and Inland Empire), to his WKCR weather reports, to the apocryphal stories of his daily Bob’s Big Boy routine, and stunts like his FYC Oscar campaign for Laura Dern, he was a rich LA character, without whom the city seems that much dimmer.",

That bucket would turn out to be quite a lonely one. The Thunder immediately ripped off a 30-2 run, a rugged sequence that highlighted the qualities that make them so great on both sides of the ball. \nConsider that Oklahoma City lost the first game between these teams in large part because of the opponent's dominant duo of bigs, came into this one even smaller thanks to Isaiah Hartenstein's injury, and yet ran away with the win. The Thunder's lack of size, rather than dooming them, forced them to play compounded Thunderball and in the process showed what makes them special. Watch them work, and you'll see a coherent philosophy unifying the ways they operate on both offense and defense, one built around the drive. It is a philosophy of pressure.",

Their two games were stay-in-your-chair fascinating, even Thursday night's blowout 'Der win, which followed a game eight days earlier in which the Cavs out-delivered OKC. A case can be made that their matchup is the only one that can save a season of ratings regret and regression, and it raises the same questions that were being asked a decade ago:\nCan the NBA thrive with a championship series with two non-marquee teams? More to the point, a bunch of non-marquee players? And finally, why does that matter?",

I'd look at the Los Angeles skyline at whatever shade of yellow-orange-brown muck the fires had delivered that day and take a photo, and then I'd scurry back inside. Against my better judgment, one time I took my mask off for one second and immediately felt ill. The entire city smelled like a funeral pyre.\nBack inside, I would turn on my TV, switch it to a local news station, and leave it on all day. I wouldn't shut it off until a few hours before bed, when my husband and I would watch some scripted TV to unwind—unless the flames were getting a little too close, which only happened once. Local TV news and its updates became the soundtrack of my days, complete with its bright graphics, specific music, and the parade of weary-but-pulling-through-it anchors tossing to extremely awake but often harried live reporters. It was from local TV where I learned where to donate supplies for those who lost everything in the fires. It was on local TV that I—and many Angelenos—learned about a fire in the Hollywood Hills, later dubbed the Sunset Fire, that sparked up Wednesday night and required immediate evacuations in the heart of Hollywood. And it was on local TV where I first heard the stories of the people who died.",

It happened early in the second quarter, with the Ravens leading 7-0 and the Steelers facing a third-and-2 from their own 28. Russell Wilson flipped a pass toward the right flat to tight end Pat Freiermuth. Just after the 6-foot-5, 258-pound Freiermuth caught the ball, Ravens safety Ar’Darius Washington—who stands all of 5-8, 180—came smashing into him. Washington proved to be no fly on Freiermuth’s windshield. He quickly brought Freiermuth to the ground just short of the sticks.\nRather than risk failure on fourth-and-1, Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin decided to punt. It goes without saying that this was cowardice, even though it was the Steelers’ inability to gain one yard on back-to-back plays that contributed to the previous week’s loss to the Bengals. ”We have to be able to make routine plays routinely,” Tomlin would later say.",

There is a good reason for this: He was the last genuinely and instinctively funny person in baseball history. He was the god of Milwaukee even if you include all the Green Bay Packers going back to before Vince Lombardi. He was the face and voice of baseball cinema, the man whose line-reading made \"Ju-u-u-u-st a bit outside\" so good that \"iconic\" doesn't remotely cover its impact. Even if you're not a seamhead, you likely came across Bob Uecker and smiled.\nSo Thursday's announcement that Uecker has died at age 90, due to small cell lung cancer, came as a blow. Nine decades is a good long run, but there was never a sense that he was running out of material; Uecker was still a joy to hear on Brewers broadcasts even in Year 54 of being the voice of Wisconsin baseball for two-and-a-half generations. The reaction to his passing was unanimous in the same ways and for the same reasons that the response to Vin Scully’s death was unanimous—it was an outpouring of both sadness at the loss and gratitude for all the time we got to spend with him. In an epochally angry time in America, at a moment when it isn't hard to find even anti-puppy polemics with a keystroke, Uecker gets a pass from most everyone. Yes he defined baseball, but he also managed to become more than merely Mister Baseball. From the moment of his first appearance on Johnny Carson's definitive version of the Tonight Show, which Uecker earned merely by mastering the tripartite arts of comedy writing, unabashed self-deprecation, and martini-dry humor, he was recognizable as that rarest of Americans, the guy you'd sit back down to listen to even if you were already halfway out the door. Put another way, Norm Macdonald thought he was one of the funniest men he ever met. Beat that with a stick.",

Crazy Raccoon needed to win the fight to extend the match and their tank player, Junbin, had a play to make. Playing as the hero Mauga, he prepared to use the Cage Fight ultimate ability, one of the most powerful abilities in the game. \nBut as the fight broke out between the two teams, Team Falcons' support player, Fielder, playing Brigitte, was closely tracking Junbin's movements. When Junbin hit the Q button on his keyboard, initiating his ultimate ability, Fielder was left with just milliseconds to intervene. He rushed in and fired off a perfectly timed shield bash, stunning Junbin's character and cancelling the ultimate before the on-screen animation could complete. Overwatch matches, particularly those played at a high level, are often won and lost between pixels, and in this case Fielder's reflexes made Team Falcons world champions.",

          "description": "Given that the Los Angeles fires are still active, and given furthermore that the destruction they have wrought seems to be nearly area-wide, the idea of a basketball game worth watching in Los Angeles right now seems almost preposterous; whether such a game would be worth playing at all is its own debate.\nThus, we view Wednesday night's Nets-Clippers game at the Intuit Dome—the Clippers' new and lavishly toileted home, a building that has generated no discernible buzz even from the moment it opened in October—with little of the wonder or delight one can usually derive from a game in which one team is fully staffed and the other is barely at half strength. Which was, in this case, also one in which the home team had a full day's rest and was playing at home and the other had played the night before 1,100 miles away. I mean, what could the end result possibly be? Well, you guessed wrong. It was miles worse than that.",

          "description": "Neither I nor the Sabres attempted a shot on goal during the third period of Buffalo's game against the Hurricanes Wednesday night. We're so alike in many respects. However, despite going shotless over the 20 minutes, the Sabres scored an insurance goal to put away the Canes and complete Ryan McLeod's first career hat trick, whereas I accomplished none of those things. Some entities have all the luck.\nThe stinky Sabres jumped out to a three-goal lead on the playoff-bound Canes on the back of a Dylan Cozens goal bookended by a pair of McLeod tallies, but few leads are safe with this team—they've blown two multi-goal leads this month alone, including in their previous game. And the Canes roared back with a pair in the third, as they dominated the ice, outshooting Buffalo 8-0 in the frame and 37-24 on the night.",

          "description": "The Milwaukee Bucks have posted a 20–10 record since the first week of November, rising over that time from the bottom of the East up to fourth. Their rotten start certainly will continue to weigh on their playoff positioning—they can entirely forget about fighting for the East's top seed—but the Bucks are now clear of the play-in mess. An honest sizing-up of the field suggests things will probably stay this way: The couple of semi-credible teams behind them in the standings are either crabbed to hell (Orlando) or caught in states of dopey semi-seriousness (Indiana and Atlanta). Pending further notice, the Bucks are no longer Milwaukee Butt.\nOn Wednesday night, they beat the hell out of a Magic team stripped by injury of all but one of their handful of guys capable of making the basketball go into the basket. This was a laugher from very early on. Orlando led, 9–8, after a slow start, but from about the 7:30 mark of the first quarter the Bucks ripped off 19 straight points, and then went ahead by 26 points early in the second quarter. The game was never much of a contest again.",

          "description": "Since Jan. 7, devastating fires in and around Los Angeles have burned more than 40,000 acres of land, an area slightly larger than Washington D.C. They have razed or damaged more than 12,300 homes and other structures. At least 24 people have died. This number will likely rise as the fires continue to burn and leave communities with not only the lingering carcinogenic effects of wildfire smoke, but also the chemicals emitted as buildings burn. Although the particulars of the destruction may have been unpredictable, the fires were not. Southern California has been bone dry for the better part of a year, and temperatures in the American Southwest have been warmer than average over the past three months. One climate scientist, Daniel Swain of the University of California Los Angeles, wrote a blog post on Jan. 4 warning that \"a high-end offshore wind/fire event may unfold in SoCal this week.\"\nTo grasp the full extent of the conditions that sparked the fires, it is important not just to look to this last, dry summer but also the unusually wet winters that preceded it. This cycle between extremely dry conditions and extremely wet conditions is known as \"hydroclimate whiplash,\" and in an eerie coincidence, Swain and colleagues, including Danielle Touma, a climate scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, published a review paper on the subject this week, in the journal Nature Reviews Earth & Environment. As Touma noted, such coincidences are likely to become more commonplace as extreme weather events become more frequent amid climate change.",
