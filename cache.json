Nature seems able to produce it effortlessly, infusing tones of green plants' tissues with the brilliant emerald pigment chlorophyll.

Historically, most dyes used as favorite greens by painters, tailors, architects, and artisans have been foul, treacherous substances. Even today, in the era of synthetic dyes and more sustainable chemistry, producing green involves rather unpleasant heavy metals and releases side products that are difficult to neutralize. from The Wallpaper That Killed the Emperor [Przekroj]",

          "description": "Freud's final works during his lifetime were dedicated to the force of denial, as well as to an investigation of religion, and the psychobiography of Wilson provides an important antecedent. If the ego can completely split from reality, believing two contradictory ideas at once, then rationalization runs deep. In fact, this kind of splitting has a lot to do with our inability to reckon with our own bisexuality. Thus, splitting goes all the way down. \"[F]rom the point of view of 'success in life,'\" writes Freud, \"psychic disturbance may actually be an advantage.\" from Freudulence by Jamieson Webster [LARB; ungated]\nThis is a timely moment for Patrick Weil's The Madman in the White House: Sigmund Freud, Ambassador Bullitt, and the Lost Psychobiography of Woodrow Wilson (2023), which provides a reassessment of the much-disputed book that Freud and American ambassador William C. Bullitt wrote about Woodrow Wilson, speculating about the president's mental health. That book, Thomas Woodrow Wilson: A Psychological Study, has been much maligned through the years, renounced by Anna Freud and Erik Erikson, to name a few; the book is not included in the Standard Edition of Freud's complete works. But reading the two books in tandem makes Freud's cautionary message regarding human illusions resound, particularly as they affect politics. Since I am a psychoanalyst, you would think that I would know this human impediment intimately, and yet resistance is such that I felt startled revisiting Freud and Bullitt's basic intuitions about a former American president. The contemporaneity of the book shook me. It was as if they were speaking to our current predicament, close to 100 years later.",

Furthermore, painters are not constrained by reality, meaning that they could paint materials without exactly following the laws of nature, while still evoking the perception of materials. Paintings have to our knowledge not been studied on a big scale from a material perception perspective. In this article, we studied the perception of painted materials and their attributes by using human annotations to find instances of 15 materials, such as wood, stone, fabric, etc. Participants made perceptual judgments about 30 unique segments of these materials for 10 material attributes, such as glossiness, roughness, hardness, etc. We found that participants were able to perform this task well while being highly consistent. Participants, however, did not consistently agree with each other, and the measure of consistency depended on the material attribute being perceived. Additionally, we found that material perception appears to function independently of the medium of depiction—the results of our principal component analysis agreed well with findings in former studies for photographs and computer renderings.\r\n\r\nCitation:\r\n\r\nvan Zuijlen, Mitchell JP, Sylvia C.

Karpf also notes that the venture capital chapter focuses around Palantir founder (and his new boss) Peter Thiel, as well as Silver's lack of consideration of systemic risk.",

NPR reports on a ProPublica investigation into why therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists are leaving insurance networks and only accepting cash for treatment.\nYou may not be surprised to learn that the primary cause is that insurance companies are actively trying to avoid paying for mental health treatment. As insurance networks add more ghost therapists and refuse to raise reimbursement rates, many independent mental health providers have stopped taking insurance entirely. I definitely noticed this in my recent search for a mental health provider, none of the psychiatrists I looked into would accept insurance for initial payment (but some were in network and would help file for reimbursement).",

The weeks sort of roll over without seeming to add up; things are happening, but nothing of any great consequence; it is the third week of July for an entire month. And then, abruptly but inevitably, you are staring down the barrel of Labor Day, and the resumption of all the things that, while they were never really gone, had previously been so easy to forget.

This is good to know, because they sure do look done, and just one week ago, the full Mariners mourning began. Back then, FanGraphs gave the Mariners a 10.9 percent chance of making the playoffs, down from a 91.7 percent peak on June 18th, when they held a 10-game lead in the AL West standings.\nThe eye test and emotional valence test concur with these evil and cruel numbers. The latter half of the season has been dogged by eye-watering strikeout rates in spite of a concerted effort to cut down on strikeout rates; as we all know, out of all the ways to drive poor offensive production, strikeouts are the worst. And if a strikeout-happy offense isn't enough, the bullpen—missing Gregory Santos and Matt Brash terribly—has been an underrated tragedy despite the innings that the starting rotation is putting in. That brings us to one week ago—when manager Scott Servais learned of his firing from Twitter.",

The Texas Rangers, experiencing some turbulence at the very end of their Wednesday doubleheader against the Triple-A team from the South Side of Chicago, were glad that they had Travis Jankowski's glove to collect any and all White Sox ejecta.\nThe Rangers had won earlier in the day in fairly uneventful 3-1 fashion, in a game suspended after just four rainy pitches on Tuesday. On the B-side, they had a little more trouble, taking a tie into the ninth before Corey Seager delivered a 4-3 lead. In the bottom half, Jankowski entered for Wyatt Langford, who'd smashed a dinger for all the other Texas runs, and relief pitcher Andrew Chafin got into some trouble. Chicago put runners on first and second with one out, and Andrew Vaughn came to the plate looking to create a rare moment of joy for a team with 31 wins all season.",

For every Joe Buck or Mike Breen, there’s a metric ton of blowhards, constantly drowning viewers in mediocre anecdotes, dire mispronunciations, gaps in knowledge, and poor feel for the moment. But pro sports aren’t the only spaces where the commentary team might make you want to slam your head into a wall. In Paralympic sport, complicated, often obscure competitions—some of which make dressage seem like it has the viewership of the NFL in comparison—battle with societal perceptions and a lack of investment. The result is a commentary landscape that is filled with inexperience, errors, bias, and frustration. \nDoes it have to be this way? With the start of the 2024 Paralympics this week, here’s an examination of some reasons why para-sport announcing tends to fail to clear all the hurdles—often the very first one.",

At issue is an apparent attempt by DraftKings to wriggle out of millions of dollars in licensing fees it allegedly owes the NFLPA as part of the gambling company's failed NFT venture, Reignmakers.\nThe complaint (embedded below) says that DraftKings \"placed a large bet on the future of non-fungible tokens (NFTs)\" with its Reignmakers program, one which involved committing \"substantial guaranteed payments\" to the NFLPA in order to license the names, images, and likenesses (NIL) of current NFL players. DraftKings abruptly shut down the Reignmakers program at the end of July, after three years of relatively stable operation, stranding its base of players with vast holdings of worthless digital tokens, and attempted to terminate its NIL contract with the NFLPA. The NFLPA, in its lawsuit, says DraftKings \"assumed the risks inherent in its product\" when it leapt into the horseshit NFT business, and should not be allowed to back out of guaranteed payments now that the scam has failed.",

Her comeback season has been stippled with seemingly equal amounts of tremendous near-misses, encouraging results, and frustrating setbacks, with her highest level only occasionally poking up above the surface, as great as ever. I could not have dreamed up as tantalizing a matchup as she actually had.\nOpposite her on Tuesday was Jelena Ostapenko, the Latvian trigger-puller whose defiance of fashion, match, and social norms makes her appointment viewing, even when she's not taking on a four-time Grand Slam champion. Both players hit the tennis ball as if trying to vaporize it, both have had uneven years, and both have higher risk tolerances than most. It promised to be a tennis match for the firearms enthusiasts, more or less. First to 100 unforced errors loses, that sort of thing. Instead, Osaka swept Ostapenko off the court with a dominant 6-3, 6-2 win in just 64 minutes. She made just five unforced errors, all in the second set, as she picked up her first top-10 win since January 2020.",

          "description": "The days leading up to and immediately following the 20 rounds of the Major League Baseball draft are some of the most intense and stressful in the baseball calendar. The games that big-league teams are playing around then have a familiar bleary early-summer insignificance, but their front offices are sifting through data and scouting reports before drafting a combined 600 players to try and set the course for the future of the franchise. The 2024 draft introduced a new element of stress into this equation, with new organizational rules limiting how many players a team can have in their system. Per these rules, for every player drafted and signed, another must be cut. “You have to ask yourself a question as you’re going through a 20-round draft,” one team employee told me. “Who is this guy that I’m drafting replacing in our organization? You have to have around 20 guys that you’re willing to let go of.”\nWhen Major League Baseball and the Minor League Baseball Players Association ratified their bargaining agreement prior to the 2023 season, the league agreed to improve living conditions for minor leaguers, offering a higher quality of food, giving them the rights to their name, image, and likeness, promising not to cut any more minor league teams for the duration of the agreement, and paying out dramatic increases in annual salary. The league agreed to all that under one condition: the ability to cap a team's domestic rosters, first at 180 players in 2023 and then at 165 for 2024 and beyond.",

And what other works does this book want to, visually, place itself alongside? Consider the phenomenon of the blob.\nIf you perused a bookstore's new fiction section anytime between 2019 and 2023, you probably saw a bunch of books festooned by indistinct, pastely swatches of color. A bunch of smart, incisive things have been written about the color blob trend over the course of its moment as the book cover trend du too many jours, and the template was so ubiquitously adhered to that you didn't even have to have read You Exist Too Much or The Vanishing Half to have understood its deal. Book cover design, like any other field of design, moves in waves. While the color blob was preceded by the two-dimensional color block meta and the headless woman fad, there are some particularities to note. Blobwave's rise was contemporaneous with that of algorithmic book-buying, both on Amazon and on social media, and as Print noted three years ago, color blob design represented a \"'safe' route disproportionately taken in service of women of color and debut authors.\"",

Practically an entire season's worth of story has happened with nearly every character already. Just thinking about where things could possibly go from here overwhelms me. With that in mind, let's check back in on our beloved characters' delightfully volatile trajectories.\nHarper Stern: Going Up! Up! Up! Harperhive, we are so back! And we are eating good in this neighborhood. Last week, she was scratching that girlboss itch with Petra Koenig that had been dormant for so long, already showing that she has not learned a thing after being fired from Pierpoint, and salivating for her moment of revenge. She helped Petra undermine their boss Anna by balancing out Lumi's nosediving stock and got her an advantageous price by doing a little cheating. But last week was merely an appetizer for Harper's full supervillain pivot on Sunday. Her and Petra test the waters of striking out on their own and right when it looked like it was going to blow up on the launchpad, she decides to put all the chips on the table and make her move in public, bridge-burning fashion. And not only is she rewarded for this, with a billionaire benefactor who seems to favor her even more than Petra, but she gets the added benefit of forcing Pierpoint's (and specifically Eric's) hand by becoming a client. Harper played the hits in this episode and it was absolute magic, showing a wolfish delight in forcing Eric to bend the knee, puppet-mastering her supposed friend Yasmin and business partner Petra, and winning the respect of Otto Mostyn. Her downfall is inevitable and will be one for the ages certainly, but for the moment, Harper and the Harper fanbase are shining bright like a diamond.",

The new car smell of a season built on hope is gone, the daily grind of playing in 102-degree heat and 98 percent humidity has become oppressive, and the significant stuff doesn’t start until next month. The most you can really expect from the fauna who bring us baseball is strictly improv. Not pure athleticism, which we can see every day in every other sport, or jaw-slackening power, which we see every day from Aaron Judge, or even child-searing heartbreak, which is implicit if we are for whatever macabre reason watching Little League baseball on television. And this doesn’t even include the White Sox, who are plenty weird but also exist in context and in any event are still 19 losses away from their own version of nirvana. What you want, and the best you might get, is something inconsequential that you will most likely never see again.\nSo we should start with Danny Jansen, who became the first player in MLB history to play for both teams in the same game on Monday. You likely already know this, because we've had days to prepare for it—and, given that it’s August and all, because there has been plenty of coverage from a baseball media reduced to waiting for its local team's next soon-to-be-failed phenom to be promoted from Double-A. Jansen had just fouled off the first pitch he saw while batting for Toronto against the Red Sox in Fenway Park on June 26 when a storm blew up the game; when it was resumed 61 days later, Jansen found himself catching the conclusion of his at-bat for those very Sox, who acquired him at the trade deadline exactly a month earlier. He struck himself out, with Daulton Varsho playing the role Jansen originated; Jansen convinced Nick Pivetta to beat Faux Jansen with a four-seam fastball and a slider in the dirt.",

          "description": "Kelsey Plum spent much of this past Wednesday's Lynx-Aces game complaining to and about the refs. She brought up uneven officiating in a halftime sideline interview: The Lynx “move on all their screens.” But by the time the postgame press conference started, the Vegas guard had somewhat changed her tune. “She cooked me,” Plum said, trying to explain Minnesota guard Courtney Williams's 22-point performance that night. “She had it tonight, and when you get your ass kicked, you gotta give the other people credit.”\nThat's one reason not to read too much into that game, and why I felt uncomfortable using it to construct some broader point about the Las Vegas Aces' defense, which dominated last season but has so far disappointed in 2024. Sometimes other team will just shoot well. The Lynx finished 11-for-19 from behind the arc in their 98-87 win on Wednesday. Williams indeed cooked Plum, but as head coach Becky Hammon pointed out afterward, Williams almost exclusively takes the “long, off-the-dribble twos” teams can live with giving up. Minnesota punished every botched defensive rotation—the same thing they've done to 10 other teams. That probably says more about the Lynx than it does about the Aces.",

It feels petty and niggling to talk about details like that, next to the delusions of grandeur that got Kennedy so much attention and publicity.

As Fanatics wrote in the amended complaint, the involvement of multiple Marvins Harrison helped facilitate and further their alleged defrauding of one of the most loathed companies in sports.\nAt issue in the initial suit was a contract dispute between Harrison Jr. and Fanatics over a name, image, and likeness (NIL) term sheet the two parties agreed to in 2023, before Harrison Jr. got to the NFL. Fanatics claims that this document is legally binding—in the suit, the company repeatedly refers to it in headline case as a Binding Term Sheet, though traditionally what differentiates a term sheet from a contract is that the former is not legally binding—and that Harrison Jr. has not fulfilled his obligations under it. Harrisons Jr. and Sr. posit, in return, that as they only signed a term sheet and not a contract, they do not in fact have a binding deal with Fanatics.",

Selling the damage of a match is a non-negotiable part of the job for anyone in the business, but for Danielson, acting out his character's pain feels almost like an act of sadism. He's 43 years old, near the end of a full-time run that began 25 years ago, and still carrying the weight of a multi-year hiatus due to a little thing called \"career-ending\" concussion problems. Particularly after making the move from the PG WWE to PG-13 AEW in 2021, his matches became bloodier, grittier, and more of a high-wire act for his visibly deteriorating body.\nWhile Danielson's time with the company has cemented his legacy, his road with AEW has also been continually blocked by legitimate injuries, like the broken arm he suffered during a PPV main event last summer (he finished the match) or the broken orbital bone he picked up in the fall shortly after returning. Mixed in with those real-life scares, however, have been creative choices that prey on the emotions they've stirred—mid-match doctor checks, mimed fencing responses, and this drama, following a PPV match in April.",

          "description": "Paul Skenes of the Pittsburgh Pirates may win the National League Rookie of the Year. In one of the most fucked-up baseball developments I can remember, Skenes has only allowed more than three runs in a start once all season, and has not failed to pitch at least five complete innings since his first appearance with the Pirates, way back on May 11. He has more starts where he has allowed zero runs (four) than starts where he has allowed more than two runs (three). He doesn't qualify for any of the Baseball Reference leaderboards, but his 11.3 strikeouts per nine innings would rank second in the National League behind only Chris Sale of the Braves, and his .942 WHIP would be good for second in the majors, behind only Seattle's Logan Gilbert. He's just over a year from his first-ever professional appearance, and he's already one of the handful of best pitchers in baseball.\nGiven all of that, it's possibly freakier to suggest that Skenes might not win Rookie of the Year. He might not! Jackson Merrill, the extremely cool rookie center fielder for the Padres, is mounting a charge. He's more than held his own as a 21-year-old natural shortstop playing the most important outfield position, and his consistent and solid offensive production has been clutch for an otherwise top-heavy Padres lineup thinned out by key injuries. Baseball Reference says there are 23 fellows in the majors who've played at least 80 games in center field this season, and among that group Merrill ranks fourth in OPS+, and is tops in the National League. The only center fielder in baseball who has driven in more runs this season than Merrill is Aaron damn Judge.",

I appreciate the impulse; baseball doesn't become mythos without a cool nickname. What would the Bash Brothers or Murderers' Row be without their names? Just some guys hitting home runs. But the Judge-Soto pairing's demand for a moniker lacks staying power—to the looming distress of Yankees fans—given Soto's willingness to enter a true free agency.\nThis does not mean our duties to dinger nomenclature are discharged. The heart of the Yankees' order threw down the gauntlet on Sunday, with Soto, Judge, and Giancarlo Stanton hitting three straight home runs in the seventh inning of a one-run game to help put away the Rockies, 10-3.",

As copyright offices around the world have consistently denied protections to AI art, you run across phrases like “the copyrightability of the monkey’s work,” as judges ruling on lawsuits are forced to rely on case law related to crested macaque photographers. And that’s not even close to the weirdest precedent cited. \nThe 2023 case Thaler v. Perlmutter dealt with a copyright battle over an AI-generated picture. In ruling for the U.S. Copyright Office and its refusal to grant copyright protection, District Court Judge Beryl A. Howell wrote that a copyright has never been granted to “a work originating with a non-human.” To support this, Judge Howell called back to an 83-year-old case, Oliver v. Saint Germain Foundation, which involved a legal battle over a book purportedly dictated by an ancient Atlantean spirit. The story behind that book, and that case, is worth telling on its own merits.",
