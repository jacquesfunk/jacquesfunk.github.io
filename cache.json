This latest blow came Sunday at the hands of its crosstown rivals, as Manchester United won the local derby in almost surreal fashion, turning around a first half 1-0 deficit into a two-goals-in-two-minutes late barrage to pick up the 2-1 win at City's shell-shocked stadium. The loss alone is bad enough for City, but the way that it lost, to what looked like a flaccid United side for about 98 percent of the match, will bring even more pain to Pep Guardiola and his beleaguered squad of expensive underachievers.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnnde9CMAg8",

          "description": "Welcome to Meet Our Little Neighbors, an occasional series about the little guys who live among and around us, but rarely get the attention they deserve.\nRecently when a fly barged into my home, uninvited, I left them alone. I was feeling magnanimous and in need of some good karma. Perhaps, I reasoned, the mercy I showed this fly would return to me tenfold on some later date. I watched the fly zig-zag down my hallways and felt smugly philanthropic. How many flies got to live out the rest of their limited days on Earth in a habitat as temperate and well-attended as my pre-war apartment? Its constant buzzing, especially near my face, was annoying, and a part of me blanched each time my eyes strayed from my food, opening up the possibility for the fly to regurgitate its fly juice on my avocado toast. But these were all small, tolerable, annoyances, I reasoned. How long could a fly possibly live?",

          "description": "Six months out, the 2025 NBA Draft is primarily conceived of and talked about as the Cooper Flagg draft. This makes a certain degree of sense, as Flagg is a huge destroyer who has been kicking ass for Duke and looking every bit like the sort of prospect who could push NBA defense forward, someone without precedent (in draftese, he's been \"demonstrating the myriad ways he affects winning.\") But you don't need to be a basketball alien to be cool. Dylan Harper is a hyperskilled operator, the man widely projected to be selected one pick after Flagg, and the most magnetic player in college basketball.\nWhere Flagg is a somewhat idiosyncratic player, causing open confusion among NBA execs, there's zero uncertainty about the sort of professional Harper will be. He is the consummate modern point guard, someone who looks like he is playing at a pro level already. I don't really understand how college defenders are supposed to guard someone who is 6-foot-6 with a plus-four wingspan and this advanced of a ball-handler with both hands. Harper is the ideal driver, gliding both past and through defenders, who always appear to be flailing like used-car inflatable dancing guys in contrast to Harper's perfect balance. He's also shooting 36 percent from three—not an eye-popping number, but his mechanics are clean, not to mention beautiful, and that figure includes a ton of self-created step-back stuff and his recent hot stretch of 46 percent over the past four games. Harper had his big moment this past weekend, when he nailed a buzzer-beating three to down Seton Hall in an extremely competitive game.",

While it remains impossible to rebuild Juan Soto in the aggregate, \"Now we can afford to sign multiple guys\" is at least starting to pan out as true, if not necessarily in the hitting department. Of course, this blog is not about Juan Soto.\nLast week, the Yankees signed free agent Max Fried to an eight-year, $218 million contract. This at least covered the record-breaking portion of rebuilding Soto's contract in the aggregate, though instead of the more straightforward \"biggest contract in MLB history,\" it came with the qualifiers of being the largest guarantee for a left-handed pitcher. Also like Soto's contract, the contract has a large risk of being player-friendly toward the end—Soto will be 41 when his runs out; Fried is currently 30 with a spotty injury history—but the Yankees front office, like the Mets', will only cry about the final years if the team doesn't make some deep runs in the first few.",

They sit atop the AFC with the best record in football; they are an unstoppable juggernaut, if you just look at their record.\nBut nobody is just looking at their record. Injuries, a lack of depth, a weak offensive line, and an uncharacteristically flat offense have all combined to make this one of the least-impressive one-loss teams in memory. But wins are all that matters, and when the playoffs start the most important thing for the Chiefs will be that they have the best quarterback in football, who has found a way to win when it counts, even when it requires a little demon magic along the way. Everyone has been waiting for this football team to finally implode, but it hasn't happened yet, and they still have Patrick Mahomes.",

It has all the elements we think we deserve—points, absurd plays, points, easily caricatured main characters, points, long-to-the-point-of-seemingly-interminable-suffering fan bases, points, a coach who wants all his linemen to have touchdowns, more points, another coach who has been slagged repeatedly for not reaching let alone winning the big one, additional points, the MVP and the Coach Of The Year if you're into that sort of thing, further points, towns that fight the odds just by getting out of bed every day, another round of points, drunks jumping through furniture, and one final round of points.\nNow comes the hard part, which is coming to grips with the likelihood that we likely won't get Bills-Lions again, and having the fortitude and dignity to refuse to watch whatever matchup the National Football League tries to pretend we'd rather have instead. In other words, if it ain't Bills-Lions, we must cancel the parties, refuse to get dressed on game day, and hate-watch the Puppy Bowl instead. If we can't get it together to do the right thing in November, we may as well give it an honest go in February.",

Yes, it will be nominated for, and perhaps win, a whole shitload of Oscars. And yes, DOP Stephane Fontaine’s camerawork deserves one of those Oscars. If you want two hours of sumptuous Vatican porn (and the mood strikes me more often than you’d imagine), Fontaine and director Edward Berger deliver a movie with multiple frames that are literally suitable for framing. Put those shots in a fucking museum.\nBut that ain’t what anyone’s gonna talk about coming out of the theater. What everyone is gonna talk about is, “Oh wow, can you believe that ending?” And if you haven’t seen it Conclave yet, you’ll be besieged by satisfied customers encouraging you to experience its endgame for yourself. We’re still in the Spoiler Zone for this film, so I can’t and won't talk more about how Conclave’s plot resolves itself.

          "description": "There's a kind of hush that is specific to old-growth suburbs, a quietness that is more vast and more inherent than any disturbance that kind of place can kick up. The place where I grew up is different in some ways than it was when I was growing up there, but that fundamental quiet is undisturbed. Things happen and make their various sounds—you'll hear a quick blurt of music when someone steps out of a bar to smoke or as people come and go from one of the restaurants downtown, cars go by and dogs get bossy on their walks and freight trains chug and honk over the New Jersey Transit lines when the commuter trains aren't running. People still live there, and people make noise. The part that is striking, and which is striking to me whenever I go back to see my parents in the house where I grew up, is how the totality of that suburban quiet swallows all this up. It's there and then it is gone, and there is maybe the wind in the trees or just nothing at all.\nI have lived in noisy places for longer than I ever lived in all that quiet, but the appeal of it isn't lost on me. I like how dark it gets at night there, and I like walking back from the train station down those quiet sidewalks and through all the old extraneous shortcuts of my youth. The last few times I've done this I have startled some deer standing around in a parking lot, as aimless and wary as I was when I did the same thing as a teenager; they stared at me but did not run. I am aware that it is a nice place to live and it was on balance a perfectly fine place to grow up. I understand why people live there. I am also under no illusions about how quickly and how thoroughly I would go insane if I were to try to do it again.",

But joy feels too clean and delicate a word to describe the way Hidalgo conducts herself on a basketball court: the mean mug, the wagged tongue, after a parabolic pull-up three. The screams. The screams! There is so much screaming: when she finds a teammate on the run, when she launches into someone’s shoulder at the rim, topples to the ground, and draws a foul. They convince me less of her “love for the game” than of her pure, uncut hatred for opponents.\nForget shoulder shrugs or sly smiles; Hidalgo exists on a higher plane of expression. Never has a player been so delighted to demoralize. (Perhaps I’m projecting this malevolence on account of her Instagram stories, which range from bland disavowals of same-sex marriage to the somewhat more intriguing claim that Britney Spears, Katy Perry, Beyoncé and Ariana Grande “ARE ALL WITCHES” whose music is “satanic inspired” and “designed to pull you away from the creator.” Give her credit for consistency: She’s a nut on and off the court.)",

Overstuffed and overacted (these are not complaints, mind you), Gladiator II has so much going on that the presence of (spoilers beyond this point) frickin' sharks in the frickin' Colosseum doesn't even make its Wikipedia summary. But look beyond the excesses of the film—easier said than done, given that a gladiator riding a rhinoceros like a surfboard appears not even halfway through—and there's another story here, one about how the politics of these films changed dramatically between the 2000 original and its 2024 sequel, and what that change says about the stories that America can still believe about itself.\nIn Gladiator, Rome is a civilizing force (the opening battle is a victory over barbarian tribes), and is on the verge of peacefully transitioning back to a republic. This version of Rome is a fundamentally virtuous nation that is threatened when Commodus, a vain and selfish degenerate, takes the reins of power instead of Maximus, the Cincinnatus-like humble general chosen by the dying emperor to return republicanism to the empire, who is subsequently exiled. It is essentially a late–Clinton-era narrative about America: A proud state has been brought low by the peccadillos of a flagrantly libertine leader who habitually disrespects the military, and the only way to return the nation to glory is for a morally upstanding political outsider (not one of those hated \"career politicians\") to defeat and remove this dishonorable interloper. And when Maximus completes his task and lays dying—term limited by Commodus's dagger—he demands that power be returned to the Senate. Even in death, Maximus was an institutionalist.",

          "description": "Why is Bill Belichick the new head football coach for the University of North Carolina? Reporting done by The Athletic's Jeff Howe, combined with the fact that no professional team offered Belichick a job last offseason, would indicate that Belichick was forced into a college job because the NFL no longer wants him. But sources close to the man himself would like to tell a different story, and have done so through ESPN's Seth Wickersham. No, the NFL didn't turn its back on Belichick; he turned his back on it. \"This is a big fuck you to the NFL,\" is how one of Belichick's confidants described the decision to Wickersham.\nOK, sure. It doesn't really matter if any of us believe that a guy who is just 15 victories away from breaking Don Shula's all-time wins record willingly walked away from the NFL in order to coach football at a basketball school. What matters is that Belichick, and the people around him, seem to truly believe that.",

I also want to tell you about the goldfish puppet who monologued about his existence for about three times as long as I was expecting. But first I should probably explain at least the basics.\nGive Me Carmelita Tropicana!, the final production for Soho Rep in its extremely intimate space on Walker Street, is a delirious supernatural caper written by Alina Troyano and Branden Jacobs-Jenkins. Troyano plays herself and Ugo Chukwu plays Jacobs-Jenkins as they chase the incorporeal title character—a real-life performance persona of Troyano's—through both New York City and a fantasy universe inhabited by Troyano's past characters. Both of the psychedelic experiences I mentioned appear before you in its intermission-free two hours (a good thing; you won't want to escape), along with so much more that can't be done justice as written words, and maybe shouldn't. The momentum and elements of surprise never falter. This is a kaleidoscopic celebration of freedom, of all you can do with craftsmanship, imagination, and an audience willing to join you on the journey.",

Actually, to be honest, there's only one thing you can tell about people based on their capacity for reveling in others' misery, and that's how much of a bastard they are. But it’s very good for that.\nWith that in mind, our tale. Our niece traveled from Oregon with her son so that they could take in Thursday's Rams-49ers game in Santa Clara, a sort of family treat gone amusingly wrong. That should explain the schadenfreude thing. Sure, being at that soggy and miserable slog was awful for them, but at least we stayed dry and warm and drank for free.

His heart-stopping title match against Ding Liren came down to an inexplicable endgame blunder in the 14th and final game. The challenger had taken the match lead in Game 11 only to lose in Game 12, as Ding looked set to once again come from behind to win in a world championship match. All tied up going into final classical game, we looked inevitably headed for the simplest of draws when Ding blundered a technical endgame win. Gukesh took advantage and now stands astride the chess world, $1.35 million richer, as its new king. \nLet’s recap Games 8-14, notating moves which actually occurred during the games in bold, and hypothetical variations which did not occur but could have in italics.

          "description": "Located near Kilmartin in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, Poltalloch House is a significant 19th-century mansion now in ruins. Constructed between 1849 and 1853, the house was designed by William Burn, a prominent architect known for his work in the Scottish Baronial style. Built for the Malcolm family, who were influential landowners in the area, the mansion features characteristic elements of the style, including turrets, battlements, and crow-stepped gables.\n\r\nThe house's decline began during World War II when it was requisitioned by the military. The wartime use led to significant wear and tear. After the war, the high costs of maintenance and changing economic circumstances contributed to the mansion's abandonment in the mid-20th century. Over time, Poltalloch House fell into disrepair, with its roof collapsing and interior largely destroyed.\n\r\nToday, Poltalloch House stands as a ruin. While no full restoration has been undertaken, there have been efforts to stabilize the structure to prevent further deterioration. Despite its dilapidated state, the house remains an important example of William Burn’s architectural work and the Scottish Baronial style that was popular in the Victorian era. It is fascinating to view the way in which nature has taken over the ruins with many trees and vines running over the crumbling structures. The mansion and the surrounding estate are historically significant to the region, reflecting the social and economic history of Scotland’s aristocracy.",

In World War I, the Royal West African Frontier Force served in operations against German forces in then-Togoland. In World War II, the strategic location of the port of Freetown meant it was fortified and became a critical base for protecting sea routes to the Middle East, India, and Australasia.\n\r\nThe vast majority of these forces were native Africans, many of them Sierra Leonean. Sierra Leoneans served as soldiers in the Frontier Force, and an even larger number served in the Carrier Corps. Combat in the African interior relied on vast quantities of materiel, but a lack of roads and mechanization meant that often the only effective method of transport was on the heads of the Carrier Corps.\n\r\nSierra Leonean forces saw combat from East Africa to Italy, and faced a grim death toll. Besides death in combat, many hundreds died of sicknesses including dysentery, tuberculosis, and especially malaria. The Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery honors soldiers who died during service in World War II. The cemetery contains the graves of 70 West African and four British soldiers.",

Designed to protect up to 150 workers, the structure, however, ultimately went unused, as Sweden remained largely untouched by the war.\n\r\nWhile relatively common in wartime Germany, this type of above-ground bunker is believed to be the only one of its kind in Sweden. Drawing on the pioneering work of engineer Leo Winkel, known for creating Winkeltürme (“Winkel Towers”) or Spitzbunker (“Pointed Bunkers”), the structure embodies both functionality and creativity. \n\r\nThe air raid shelter’s tall, narrow, circular base, with a metal-reinforced pointed top, was crafted to be nearly invisible to enemy bombers and exceptionally difficult to destroy. Even a direct hit would cause the payload to glance off the surface, rather than penetrating the walls.\n\r\nOvergrown with vines, the Spetsbunker remains a stoic sentinel. Though closed to the public, its weathered interior features a spiral staircase, platforms, and a central shaft with a winch. Its distinctive silhouette continues to serve as both a historical landmark and a reminder of wartime innovation.",

One thing that hasn't changed much over time though, is the urge to put art on the bottom of the boards. You can see this in the collection at the Geneva Skateboard Museum, which showcases boards from different eras of skateboarding.\n\r\nThe museum is made and run by Jim Zbinden, who has had the dream of this museum in mind for nearly 30 years. The first iteration of the museum came in the early 2000s. Hundreds of skateboards were displayed to show the intricate and unique art that has been a part of skateboarding culture for the last seven decades. \n\r\nIn the museum's current location, you'll find three floors where each inch of wall and ceiling space is covered with skateboards and skateboard paraphernalia. The collection has everything from old used boards to new display boards to boards that belonged to famous skaters like Tony Hawk. This makes the museum interesting even for those who have never touched a skateboard in their lives.",

Located in Jiufen—a mountain town famous for its mist-shrouded scenery, narrow alleyways, and vibrant tea houses—the museum immerses visitors in the spiritual and supernatural aspects of Taiwanese culture.\n\r\nWhile the museum only includes a couple of rooms, it is full of items and statues that showcase the diverse types of spirits and ghosts prominent in Taiwanese and East Asian folklore. It features iconic spirits like the gui (ghosts of those who suffered an unjust or tragic death) and jiangshi (the “hopping” vampires of Chinese myth). Explanatory panels accompany life-sized models, artifacts, and illustrations, offering a glimpse into the roles these spirits play in Taiwanese belief systems and rituals. Hidden inside a cabinet, a grotesque Krasue—a Southeast Asian demon with the internal organs exposed and connected to a flying female head—welcomes the visitor by repeating what they said while opening the door.\n\r\nOne of the highlights is the depiction of the Hungry Ghost Festival, an important event in Taiwan and other East Asian countries, when it’s believed that the gates of the underworld open, allowing spirits to visit the living. This exhibit showcases offerings, lanterns, and other ceremonial objects used to appease wandering souls, along with life-sized models that recreate festival scenes.\n\r\nThe museum displays a collection of traditional talismans, amulets, and symbols that people use to ward off evil spirits or attract good luck, especially related to Taoism. Visitors can learn about the symbolism behind each item and how they’re used in rituals to protect against misfortune or mischief from vengeful spirits, including a sword made of coins used by Taoist exorcists.\n\r\nThe place is built as an open photo booth, where visitors can take pictures while using the items around, lying inside coffins, or joining a set of heads inside jars.",

          "description": "While virtually every city has a tree that can claim to be the oldest, not many have a story as interesting as the one in Paris. Located in Square René Viviani within sight of the Notre Dame, an ancient black locust tree grows behind a wire fence. Surrounded by vibrant moss and saplings, its age is given away by the (somewhat poorly) camouflaged concrete struts that help support its heavier branches.\n\r\nSomething surprising about the oldest tree in the French capital is that it's not actually French. It was brought from Appalachia by the Parisian botanist Jean Robin, who found that many North American plants were suited to the temperate French climate. The entire genus of locust trees was later named for Robin, giving the Parisian tree the scientific name Robinia pseudoacacia. (The “pseudo” comes from the fact that while similar to acacias, the robinia is not closely related.)\n\r\nThe introduction of these trees to Europe has been somewhat of a mixed bag. It grows fast and strong, so it has been used to repopulate deforested areas and to provide lumber. The flowers are used in a surprising amount of foodstuffs, from teas, pancakes, and fritters to the renowned acacia honey. As they are quite shady, pollution-resistant, and long-lived, they became a popular fixture along city streets. It is this hardiness, however, that also makes it a pest.\n\r\nIn many parts of Europe, uncontrolled black locust growth has made it classified as an invasive species. Australia and South Africa have deemed it a weed. Even in North America, it can be considered invasive as it spreads away from the Appalachian region and converts native grasslands into forests. While there have been efforts to eliminate the spread of black locust to areas where it isn’t wanted, Paris does its best to keep its patient zero alive. The crutches that hold up its branches give the impression that the old tree might be a couple of centuries past its prime. Time will tell how long it holds its impressive title.",

          "description": "Spain’s Catalonia region has a noble and diverse cheesemaking legacy, with unique cheeses ranging from mató, a cottage cheese often drizzled with honey and eaten at dessert, to tupí, a product made from leftover bits of cheese that have been fermented in a clay pot with booze. \n\r\nBarcelona was largely absent from this legacy until 2019, when Italian former veterinarian and self-professed “super lover of cheese” Francesco Cerutti opened Pinullet. Claiming to be the only cheesemaker in Barcelona, Cerutti uses organic milk to produce as many as nine different varieties of cheese right in the city center. \n\r\nEvery Monday, Cerutti receives a shipment of 1,000 liters of raw milk from a farm with three cows in Cardadeu, a village 40 kilometers northeast of Barcelona. Come Tuesday, the largely self-taught cheesemaker might turn this into a fresh cheese such as queso fresco, a couple Italian-style pasteurized cheeses such as mozzarella or ricotta, and three to four raw milk aged French-style cheeses such as a Camembert- or a Tomme-style cheese. He also produces yogurt and cheeses seasoned with ingredients ranging from truffles to chilies.\n\r\nCerutti’s so-called “cheese laboratory” spans a workroom, refrigerators for aging cheese, and a shopfront, where he also sells a few bottles of wine and other products, in addition to those cheeses. These days, he sells the bulk of what he produces to local restaurants.",

          "description": "Located on the hillside near Granada’s city center, the Albaicín neighborhood features many historic buildings. In fact, the area is part of the UNESCO World Heritage site that includes the Alhambra. Businesses in this area tend to cater to tourists, but the Palacio de los Olvidados (Palace of the Forgotten) has taken a rather unique approach.\n\r\nThe 16th-century mansion sits in a narrow alleyway on the lower hillside of the neighborhood. The structure features four floors with a patio on the third floor that provides nice views of the Alhambra and a small fenced-in courtyard on the ground level. However, if the building did not operate as a tourism business, it would largely blend into the cityscape.\n\r\nThe ground floor of the Palacio de los Olvidados features a performance space named Palacio Flamenco. Granada is located in Andalucia, where flamenco originated from the intermingling of Muslim, Jewish, and Gitano cultures within the region, and these performances are quite popular.\n\r\nThe upper floors of the building feature a torture museum called the Museo de la Inquisición (Museum of the Inquisition). This space includes full replicas of many of the types of instruments of torture used during the medieval era but especially by the Spanish Inquisition after the Reconquista. The highlights include an iron maiden, a spiked interrogation chair, and a brazen bull (a metal statue of a bull where a person would be shut inside and then roasted alive by a fire lit below the statue). Additional special exhibitions are organized on the museum's top floors.\n\r\nWhile the combination of these attractions may seem completely incongruous, this combination makes the Palacio de los Olvidados stand out from the crowd.",

For whatever reason, they fully wrapped the burger and then placed it in a clamshell box.\n\n\nThe beef patty offered a robust meaty flavor. It was thick but just a tad short in width to achieve full bread coverage. The grind was a little too fine for a burger. There was a nice browned crust on the patty but none of the crunch you might get from a smashed patty. The temperature was warm rather than hot.\n\n\n\nThe sourdough rounds were not sour at all and only lightly crispy. They were mostly soft and chewy.\nThe American cheese was thoroughly melted and gooey.\n\n\n\nThe pickles and onions combined to provide a watery crunch. The onions were lightly sweet while the pickles added a dose of acidity. Tying it together with a combination of savory and sweet notes was the Boss Sauce.\n\n\n\nOverall, Jack in the Box's Sourdough Smashed Jack presented a solid burger that felt pricey for what you get.\nRead more at Brand Eating!",

          "description": "A few weeks ago, in a post primarily complaining about Google’s disingenuous claims about their Messages app’s support for encryption (they suggest, heavily, that it encrypts every message or most messages, but fact only supports encryption for RCS message sent between users of Google Messages on Android devices), I also complained about the fact that Google’s own Google Voice doesn’t support RCS at all.\nTurns out Google Fi doesn’t support RCS fully either. Google Fi is Google’s cellular phone service. I actually use it to provide service to my Android burner phone. The prices are excellent and the service is fine for my minimal needs for a phone I barely use. But Google Fi offers something called “call and voicemail sync” that lets Fi users make and answer voice calls through the web. If you enable this, you lose RCS. See Reddit threads here and here with Fi fans complaining about it.\nIt’s just wild to me that Google would spend years waging a campaign urging Apple to support RCS, yet Google itself doesn’t support RCS in its own products.\n ★",

          "description": "After being sold out for months, the upcoming sponsorship schedule at DF is wide open at the moment — including the final two weeks of the year. I know sponsors are sometimes hesitant to book weeks around major holidays, but, well, Daring Fireball is never “closed”. And traffic to the site is remarkably consistent even during weeks like Thanksgiving and Christmas. Nerds get bored and want to read interesting stuff.\nQ1 2025 weeks are wide open too, but I only just now opened those weeks on the calendar.\nWeekly sponsorships have been the top source of revenue for Daring Fireball ever since I started selling them back in 2007. They’ve succeeded, I think, because they make everyone happy. They generate good money. There’s only one sponsor per week and the sponsors are always relevant to at least some sizable portion of the DF audience, so you, the reader, are never annoyed and hopefully often intrigued by them. And, from the sponsors’ perspective, they work. My favorite thing about them is how many sponsors return for subsequent weeks after seeing the results.\nIf you’ve got a product or service you think would be of interest to DF’s audience of people obsessed with high quality and good design, get in touch. And again, this coming week remains open, and the week after. I’m even offering those two weeks at a holiday discount.\n ★",

          "description": "Joe Rossignol, MacRumors:\nApple plans to stop selling the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and\nthird-generation iPhone SE in European Union countries later this\nmonth, to comply with a regulation that will soon require\nnewly-sold smartphones with wired charging to be equipped with a\nUSB-C port in those countries, according to French blog\niGeneration. All three of these iPhone models are still\nequipped with a Lightning port for wired charging.\nIn a paywalled report today, the website said the iPhone models\nwill no longer be sold through Apple’s online store and retail\nstores in the European Union as of December 28, which is when the\nregulation goes into force.\nIt was never clear to me whether this regulation only applied to new devices, or to existing ones. But I guess it applies to existing ones. Until the expected next-gen iPhone SE ships early next year, the lowest-priced new iPhone in the EU will be the iPhone 15, which starts at $700 in the U.S. and around €860 in Europe. (Apple’s prices vary slightly between EU countries.)\n ★",

Perhaps the reason\nfor this is that social networks (or the social network) solved\nthis problem — for a while. When Facebook was ubiquitous it was\nprobably a pretty good reflection of many people’s real-life\nrelationships. It told you where they lived, who you knew in\ncommon, and all kinds of other details.\nAnother idea that seemed obvious was that, given how deeply social\nhumans are, social products would dominate the internet. Ten to\nfifteen years ago, this seemed inevitable.\nBut something else happened instead.\nSocial networks became “social media,” which, at first, meant\nreceiving content from people you chose to hear from. But in the\nquest to maximize engagement, the timeline of friends and people\nyou picked to follow turned into a free-for-all battle for\nattention. And it turns out, for most people, your friends aren’t\nas entertaining as (god forbid) influencers who spend their\nwaking hours making “content.”\nIn other words, social media became … media.\nTo tell you the truth, I think there are positive aspects of this\nevolution (perhaps I’ll get into that in another post). But we\nclearly lost something.\nThis whole piece is so good, so clear. This distinction between social networking and social media is obvious in hindsight, but only in hindsight. Williams posted it on Medium (natch), but Mozi’s website links directly to it for their “About” page. I’m excited about this. I think they’re on to something here. It’s even a great name.\n ★",

          "description": "Chef Hiroki Odo uses a wagyu blend, sansho peppercorns, sake, and tamari to create this decadent burger.\n “I thought it would be nice to make a hamburger that mixed New York and Japan,” says chef Hiroki Odo. Actually, he made six. At Hall, Odo’s “conceptual bar” in the Flatiron District, the limited menu features a selection of wagyu burgers, from a simple single cheeseburger to one topped with A5 wagyu steak. \nStep by step, general manager Brian Saito walks through crafting Hall’s burgers. He starts with a blend of Sakura Wagyu chuck and A5 wagyu, finely grinding them and controlling just how much fat is in each patty. Then there’s the sauce, a combination of sansho peppercorns, “a perfect complement for the fattiness of the wagyu,” reduced in sake and tamari. It’s a sauce, Saito says, they also use at chef Odo’s titular kaiseki restaurant next door. All of it gets piled on buns made from the chef’s own recipe, “so their key point is a sense of unity.”\nThe entire Hall menu is in service of wanting to bring a variety of experiences to New York diners, says chef Odo, and to showcase all the cuisines Japan has to offer. But, he admits, multiple concepts in one space “isn’t the kind of restaurant you could open in Japan.” A cocktail and burger bar, in front of a chef’s counter, next to a kaiseki restaurant? That’s New York. \nWatch the latest episode of Icons to see how Odo and Saito create one of New York’s best burgers.",

It toes the line between being fancy and flavorful without having an appalling price tag. Its deep green hue is an indicator of the high-quality matcha each tin provides, but if that doesn’t convince you, the aroma — and flavor — will. This matcha is rich, floral, and subtly sweet but rounded out by mild bitterness. It’s delicious drunk straight because the matcha is already so smooth, but I also find it adds the perfect earthy bite to matcha lattes. I love to pair it with warm milk and a drizzle of vanilla bean paste for a fragrant matcha latte that is arguably better than any of the pale, $8 versions you might order at a coffee shop. One warning: Once you try this matcha, you can never go back to the cheaper stuff (nor will you want to, anyway).\n\n\n\nNo peeking! But check out what the Eater Advent Calendar has already revealed.  And check back each day for a new clutch condiment, gadget, or nibble that, yes, makes an amazing gift — but these surprises are just for you.",

          "description": "Pull off a single holiday shopping trip while you’re picking up groceries\n Finding the time to leave the house and actually go holiday shopping might seem next to impossible. But there’s a way to make things more efficient: While you’re making the Herculean effort to pick up a take-out noodle soup or a cart full of groceries at your local Chinese, Japanese, or Korean supermarket, know that options for holiday shopping are all over the aisles. Broadly speaking, the housewares, beauty, and stationery sections at these stores are full of great gift ideas, particularly in the “stocking stuffer” category — and particularly if your recipient is really into food.\nThis online shopping guide obviously negates the whole point of picking up extra items while you’re buying groceries, but should serve as inspiration the next time you’re pushing a cart down the aisles. If you’re adding these to cart, though, throughout this guide we’ve suggested purchasing from AAPI-owned businesses alongside the bigger box retailers where possible, to keep the original spirit of the practice alive. — EDJ\nCeramic mug with lid\n\n\n\nNanoblock sets\n\n\n\nA beverage variety pack\n\n\n\nSheet masks\n\n\n\nJapanese serving bowl\n\n\n\nMatcha for tea-lovers\n\n\n\nA box of Ferrero Rocher\n\n\n\nA better lunchbox\n\n\n\nFruity hand lotion\n\n\n\nChinese Lay’s potato chips\n\n\n\nA box of really great fruit\n\n\n\nStationery sets\n\n\n\nJapanese gummies\n\n\n\nLoose-leaf tea\n\n\n\nFood-themed blind boxes\n\n\n\nRegional sauces, spreads, and chile crisps\n\n\nBento-building accessories\n\n\n\nIwako eraser sets",

Luckily, Snif makes some nostalgic, slightly over-the-top fragrances for food-lovers (see: this eau de croissant of sorts), and its Naughty Nona fragrance — which is touted as a “booze-soaked, sugared, and spiked” perfume — sounds like everything I love about this time of year. Its top notes suggest everything some people love about fruitcake: ginger, orange, rum, walnuts. And I also peeped some (slightly intimidating) perfume subreddits, where one fan of the fragrance writes, “Naughty Nonna smells like walking into a small New York corner bake shop run by an eccentric old lady that uses the pink Dove soap bar. She knows your order and saves it for you off to the side.” Who wouldn’t want to spritz that on every day? \n\n\n\nNo peeking! But check out what the Eater Advent Calendar has already revealed.  And check back each day for a new clutch condiment, gadget, or nibble that, yes, makes an amazing gift — but these surprises are just for you.",

          "description": "Ever solved a tricky problem at the command line, only to struggle documenting it later?  I built Savvy so you can capture and share your CLI solutions in seconds.\nWith a simple savvy record history command, you can:\n   - Go back in time and cherry pick commands from your shell history\n   - Automatically expand aliases\n   - Redact sensitive information locally\n   - Convert hard-coded values into runtime placeholders\n   - Export locally to markdown files or create shareable team workflows using Savvy.\n\nSome FAQs\nQ) How Does Savvy’s CLI work?\n   Savvy’s CLI uses shell hooks (full support for bash and zsh. Fish support is in beta) to capture commands. Savvy’s CLI never looks at any command outputs or active keystrokes. Users have to explicitly opt-in (by typing savvy record/savvy record history) to capture commands every single time.\n\n   Once you select a particular workflow with savvy run, savvy starts a new sub-shell and walks you through each step of the way. No manual copy paste or editing commands to provide run time values.\n\n   Demo: https://getsavvy.so/demo\n\n   Savvy takes your redacted commands as input and uses Llama 3.x hosted on Groq to create a first draft of your workflow.\n\n   Savvy ask/explain are powered by  GPT 4/GPT4o to convert natural language to shell commands and vice-versa.\n\n   GitHub: https://github.com/getsavvyinc/savvy-cli\n   Demo: https://getsavvy.so/demo\n   Docs: https://docs.getsavvy.so/guides/quick_start/\n   Example workflows: https://getsavvy.so/#examples\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42436589\nPoints: 15\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "This is our Atlas of Water Science. It's a globe mapping water science that colleagues have done over the past few years. Approx 300 papers got analyzed. The pipeline sends open access papers to an LLM asks the LLM to extract areas relevant to science in a form suitable for a geocoder, then we use a geocoder to get lat lons. When things happen in the same spot we jitter the locations a bit to differentiate things. gpt4o-mini was used for most of the analysis. Some of the features on the website are directly invented by Claude. There are some errors when geocoding went wrong or locations were extracted incorrectly.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42436556\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I'm exited to share this project I've been working on with you. Simply, it makes productivity and studying instantly rewarding and engaging from the start, increasing the chance of consistency in the long term.\nYou can start \"training sessions\" which are the timers where you are meant to focused. During this, if you are studying you can take AI generated quizzes based on certain subjects. Right now its a dropdown selection of set topics as I'm not sure of the safety of allowing people to type whatever they want to the AI, but I might change that.\nAfter the training sessions, based on the time trained and the team you have built, you receive points. These points can be used to build up your team by opening packs of various rarities. With this, you feel rewarded from getting points and being productive instantly. Along with this, you can join 'leagues' which are rooms with other people to compete to be the best. Also, you can compete in real time matches against others to make your team have more worth than show.\nIts publicly released but I'm still improving it daily and all I would like is for people to use it and give feedback, good or bad. Thank you!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42436497\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I got approached by the finance department of a large company. There is a new regulation in Europe that mandates a defined XML-format for e-invoices for some transactions and - I kid you not - their SAP implementation wasn't able to address this. They also said that all solutions on the market were either cumbersome (think: manually typing in all fields) or required deep system integration.\nI thought it cannot be that hard to use AI for this and built a little invoice converter that takes your PDF invoice in whatever form it is, and outputs exactly the XML structure that is required in the regulation. Given that AI is not perfect (but surprisingly close to it!), you can manually edit all fields.\nTarget users are companies where their current solution does not yet support the standard and that do not want to change their existing invoicing flow (incl. foreign businesses).\nTrying it out is free. Given this is my first real B2B tool, would love some feedback!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42435870\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

It works as a charm, so I, my family, and friends use it every day, precisely as planned.\nNow, I can comfortably say that I still don't know how to code, but that won't stop me and shouldn't stop any other non-coder from developing something they want anymore.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42435603\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

While the questions mostly remain the same, the answers can change and may correspond to different versions, forming a roadmap for future product success. A phenotype is the visualization of an answer, evolving as the answers change over time.\nCarton provides a framework for product scoping (not project management or product design) that makes use of this definition.\nLet's think even further. With the advent of artificial intelligence, the entire process of software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Soon, software will be created more through natural conversation than traditional programming languages.\nCarton helps ensure you always have a clear record of what you've asked from the AI and, even better, helps to request what comes next.\nIts a very early proof of concept phase.

          "description": "Hey guys,\nI wanted to show what we have been working on for the last few weeks. We have done data extraction/web scraping for the last few months, and we built this internally to help us. However, clients requested a SAAS tool, so here it is!\nYou guys can test it out here (app.potarix.com). Everyone who signs up gets 5$ credits. Scraping each page takes up $0.10 of your credits. You are not charged for unsuccessful scrapes!\nWe launched last week, and our platform was super buggy. We initially launched without the concept of \"jobs\" in our product, so every time you wanted to scrape a platform, you would have to wait 5 minutes on one screen to get your results. Something is bound to happen in those 5 minutes, so the task would fail for some unknown reason.\nLooking ahead, we built stuff in-house that we would love to include in the SAAS platform shortly. We have built functionality to click, type, scroll, etc. on the page. AI also tends to be wrong sometimes, so we created a tweakable script in the backend to control the agent's actions. That way, you are in control and can bring the script to 100% accuracy. We have also seen people battling to build infrastructure for their large-scale scraping projects. We wanna autonomously let folk set up parallelization and choose the infra for their project so everything is scraped as quickly and succinctly as possible from the SAAS.\nIf any of these future features sound interesting, feel free to book some time, and we can discuss how we can help you with these now!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42435480\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hey HN, I’ve been working on this multiplayer crossword for a while now. There’s still so much more on my todo list for it, but I think it’s time to launch and get some feedback with what I have.\nEvery hour, a new crossword (13×13 or 15×15) is generated at https://crosswordracing.com If you prefer smaller/faster, every ten minutes, a new mini crossword (7×7 or 11×11) is generated at https://crosswordracing.com/mini\nYou’re playing each crossword at the same time as everyone else, racing to complete it first. You can’t see what you’ve got right, until you correctly complete the entire grid. But you get some fun feedback on what other players are doing: a cell turns green if one other player has correctly solved it, orange if two other players have, and red if three or more other players have entered the correct letter in that cell.\nChat is emoji-only for the first half of the game (i.e. 30 minutes for the front-page, 5 minutes for the mini). After that, it unlocks and you can chat freely.\nIf you’re not done when the next crossword is generated, you can just stay on the current page for as long as you like and keep working to solve it.\nI didn’t manage to get user accounts done before my arbitrarily-imposed launch date, so everyone is anonymous for now. I definitely want to build accounts, streaks, trophies, etc. The other big thing I’m excited to build is a “team mode”. You should be able to play on a team, where you can chat freely with your team-mates, and the cell colors indicate what the other team has (collaboratively) got correct. I think that would be a lot of fun.\nThanks for reading, checking it out, and for any feedback. Feel free to ask me anything, of course.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42434157\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

You'll get notifications (email + app) when significant events matching your criteria are detected. For short-term projects, you'll be notified when your analysis is ready.\nBehind the scenes:\nWhen you give the AI Assistant a request to monitor an entity (like a stock or group of stocks), an AI Project Manager plans the project and breaks the project down into manageable tasks. These tasks run asynchronously - some recurring (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly), others one-time.\nExample prompts you can try:\nLong-term monitoring:\n- \"Monitor Apple stock and notify me of any important events and red flags\"\n- \"Monitor Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta stock. Notify me if any of them start trending toward being undervalued\"\nShort-term analysis:\n- \"Create a project to analyze the last 30 earnings calls for Tesla, spot trends, and how the business has evolved over time\"\nYou can track the progress of all tasks as the AI Agents work in the background.\nTry it here: https://decodeinvesting.com/chat\nThis is still an early version - we're actively improving it based on feedback.

          "description": "Hey HN,\nWe’re excited to share PySpur, an open-source tool that provides a graph-based interface for building, debugging, and evaluating LLM workflows.\nWhy we built this:\nBefore this, we built several LLM-powered applications that collectively served thousands of users. The biggest challenge we faced was ensuring reliability: making sure the workflows were robust enough to handle edge cases and deliver consistent results.\nIn practice, achieving this reliability meant repeatedly:\n1. Breaking down complex goals into simpler steps: Composing prompts, tool calls, parsing steps, and branching logic.  \n2. Debugging failures: Identifying which part of the workflow broke and why.  \n3. Measuring performance: Assessing changes against real metrics to confirm actual improvement.\nWe tried some existing observability tools or agent frameworks and they fell short on at least one of these three dimensions. We wanted something that allowed us to iterate quickly and stay focused on improvement rather than wrestling with multiple disconnected tools or code scripts.\nWe eventually arrived at three principles upon which we built PySpur :\n1. Graph-based interface: We can lay out an LLM workflow as a node graph. A node can be an LLM call, a function call, a parsing step, or any logic component. The visual structure provides an instant overview, making complex workflows more intuitive.  \n2. Integrated debugging: When something fails, we can pinpoint the problematic node, tweak it, and re-run it on some test cases right in the UI.   \n3. Evaluate at the node level: We can assess how node changes affect performance downstream.\nWe hope it's useful for other LLM developers out there, enjoy!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42433689\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I’ve been on the job hunt for the past few months and after going through numerous reddit threads and Linkedin posts I saw that customized resumes make a huge difference in getting callbacks. But every tool I tried was either bloated with 50+ features I didn’t need or way too expensive (some were charging $70/month!). These people think I'm made of money!\nSo I decided to build my own AI resume builder.\nIt’s simple and streamlined:\nIt takes your resume and the job post and generates  a custom resume tailored to that post. (We do not store your resume or use it to train the AI)\nWhat used to take me 20-30 minutes now takes 30 seconds.\nI’ve gotten callbacks from companies like Apple, Nvidia, Meta, and Amazon using it.\nThe pricing is designed to be accessible: the more jobs you apply to, the cheaper it gets — around $2 per resume.\nI'd love for you to try it out and let me know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42433683\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",
