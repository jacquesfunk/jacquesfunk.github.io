          "description": "At one point in time, Rory Dames was mostly known as a longtime women's soccer coach, leading the NWSL's Chicago Red Stars for about a decade as well as overseeing Chicago-area youth powerhouse Eclipse. But more recently, he's become known as a coach whom players repeatedly reported for emotional abuse and manipulation. Those reports by players did not immediately diminish Dames's power; he only resigned when those accounts began becoming public. The ensuing 234-page Yates report into systemic abuse across women's soccer included his name hundreds of times. \nU.S. Soccer, which oversees the U.S. Women's National Team as well as sanctioning the NWSL, suspended Dames's coaching license and, per USA Today, the federation reported him to the U.S. Center for SafeSport, the organization created by Congress to investigate sexual abuse across Olympic sports. SafeSport doesn't have any jurisdiction over the NWSL, but Dames's presence in the database still mattered, especially given his continued prominence in Chicago-area youth soccer. (The NWSL also banned Dames for life.) SafeSport opened an investigation into Dames, and anyone who searched its database would have found his name.",

Put another way, while everyone else was doing their preseason media fun fairs, the Knicks and Pups were frantically scrubbing their rosters for wildly differing reasons. The Knicks needed a center because they had none, and the Wolves needed Julius Randle because how better to clog the traffic in front of Anthony Edwards?\nBoth teams seem to be on the rise, at least superficially, and positioned themselves to make a blockbuster deal each can claim unconvincingly puts them over the top. The Knicks get Karl-Anthony Towns, the beetle-browed post who has frustrated as much as he has entranced because he is capable of such grand levels of enchantment, and can complete the task of making this Jalen Brunson's team. The Wolves get some cash and cap relief and a player looking for a new contract who holds the ball enough to frustrate their newfound franchise face. The new blood on both ends suggests that Minnesota's conference finals appearance and the Knicks' continued slow boil are ready for enhancement.",

But neither VCARB, or their owners at Red Bull, had released an official statement. So the day's send-offs took on a half-stated tone, none of which stemmed from his team—the commentators couched declarations about Ricciardo's final race with \"likely\" and \"may.\" Kym Illman, a Formula 1 photographer and fellow Australian, posted a photo mentioning a \"last goodbye hug.\" Fans voted him Driver of the Day.\nVCARB only made the official announcement this Thursday. The outwardly unnecessary four-day delay to the announcement would have been distasteful even for the average driver; that a company of Red Bull's profile made such an oversight could be ascribed to the year's broadly self-inflicted dysfunction that has plagued the Red Bull higher-ups. An explanation does not change the travesty that Ricciardo, a boisterous fan-favorite, is somehow leaving the sport without similarly boisterous fanfare. Putting aside what respect a 13-year career in F1 may or may not demand in return, Ricciardo was the sort of personality that could bear such ceremony: some build-up, a video, an opportunity for other drivers on the grid to share fond memories or embarrassing stories.",

          "description": "CHICAGO — On Tuesday night, the Chicago White Sox had a shot at history, if not the kind any team sets out to make. At 36-120, they were just one loss away from breaking the record for futility since the MLB started scheduling this many games. Late September baseball contests, for two thirds of the league, tend to be either dubious searches for meaning or the barest excuse for drinking beer outside, but this one was played on the precipice of a loserdom that hasn’t been seen since the 19th century, when Cleveland had a 20-134 squad called the Spiders. In the 162-game universe, the White Sox were about to surpass the 1962 New York Mets, who finished their first season of existence at 42-120.\nIt wasn’t going to happen that night. The White Sox had their first late-inning comeback of the entire season, eking out a 3-2 victory over the visiting Los Angeles Angels. In normal terms, the Angels—at 63-94—are very bad as well. They were also the recipient of most of the home crowd’s scant goodwill on that night. When Angels’ second baseman Jack López hit a home run in the seventh to put L.A. up 2-0, Sox fans cheered him—a little too much. “The bleachers were getting real rowdy and people kept getting escorted out,” a friend who was at the game told me. “It felt like folks were ready to rage.” Earlier, fans had been chanting “sell the team” vigorously enough that the Sox-employed television broadcasters couldn’t really ignore it. When the Sox finished their improbable victory, improving their record when playing from behind after the seventh inning to a hilarious 1-94, the home fans booed them for it.",

          "description": "Bun Ito, a master's student at Tokyo Metropolitan University and Nagoya University, had begun rearing some Taiwanese tree frogs, greenish yellow amphibians each about the size of a lychee. The frogs, Kurixalus eiffingeri, live in the bamboo and broadleaf forests of Taiwan and parts of Japan, and raise their young in the small pools of water in tree hollows and bamboo stumps called phytotelmata. Ito was interested in the fact that parent frogs fed their tadpoles unfertilized eggs. But he noticed something strange. \"I observed that the tadpoles were not defecating,\" he wrote in an email.\nFrom the moment a Taiwanese tree frog hatches from an egg to the moment it metamorphoses into an adult frog, between 21 and 43 days later, it eats just like any other species of tadpole. But, unlike other tadpoles, it does not appear to poop. It excretes no solid waste whatsoever until a few days after it reaches adulthood. Ito and Okada recently described the remarkable feat of these tadpoles in the journal Ecology.",

It was a final, fitting insult to fans of the Athletics, a team in the AL West that as of today used to play their home games in Oakland. Someone in the building, maybe only one single someone, had cause for celebration—not with the fans but at them.\nWith the future ripped away by John Fisher and the other owners who voted unanimously for this, what would the final major-league game on Oakland soil be like, I wondered? Would it be a party? A riot? How would the Oakland A's, an organization whose stated position to its own fans and the world at large for three years has been, more or less, We do not exist; do not regard us or our product, handle a sold-out crowd? It turns out that a fun funeral is still a funeral, and the energy that A's fans brought to the Coliseum served primarily to underscore the irrationality at the heart of the situation. They showed the baseball-watching world what the A's meant to them, while Fisher and his organization showed how little that mattered.",

          "description": "Wednesday night marked the second episode of the 47th season of Survivor—and with it, the end of an all-too-brief era. For a certain member of the chattering class, this season held the sort of promise not seen since Mike White nearly conquered that Fijian beach: a chance to watch a famous writer make a fool of themselves on national television. This year's media surrogate was none other than Pod Save America co-host Jon Lovett, a man whose list of former employers includes Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Aaron Sorkin. None of this impressed his tribe, who voted him out at the end of last week's premiere episode.\nThis week's elimination was arguably even more of an upset, but still, I found myself largely unmoved, if not bored. Some important context might be needed here: I'm not a Survivor superfan. I hesitate to even call myself a fan. Until last Wednesday, I'd watched exactly half of one season while high in an AirBnb in Burlington. If reality television is a spectrum, my tastes trend more towards docusoap (think Real Housewives, Wife Swap, Selling Sunset) than competition-based programming. It most likely comes down to the fact that I fundamentally do not understand the kind of person who would voluntarily spend weeks without running water. But what I do understand is podcasters—specifically the kind of podcaster that Lovett is. He's the sort that will say on national television, with an ain't-I-a-stinker face, \"And now when people ask me what I do, I have to say that I'm a fucking podcast host.\"",

Like the Open, there is a primetime segment that captures the audience at peak capacity—for AEW, that's the live airing of their show Dynamite from 8 to 10 p.m. But also like the U.S. Open, there is a lot left for those who stick around late into the night—a whole other tennis match, or, in AEW's case, a taping for one of their other TV obligations that stretches past midnight.\nAs such, when I leave Arthur Ashe, the atmosphere is different than the feeling leaving any other sports arena I've ever entered. The crowd is no longer a cohesive throng high on a win, crushed by a loss, or simply juiced from the action. It's more a collection of individuals thinking, We were the ones who cared enough to stick it out, and Oh god, when am I going to get to sleep?",

As the sea robin grows, the pectoral fins on either side of its body widen like two unfurling fans—still fins, if a bit extravagant. But eventually the first three rays of each fin separate. They lose their webbing, tapering into slender structures that look remarkably like legs. When adult sea robins settle on the seafloor, where they will spend the rest of their lives, they use these \"legs\" to walk, stilt-like, the rest of their body hovering a few inches above the sand.\nCorey Allard, a cell biologist and electrophysiologist at Harvard University, knew sea robins as the fish his dad and brothers frequently reeled in from the Atlantic. But he did not realize they had legs until he saw them at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. \"Never looked that closely, I guess, nor expected a fish to have legs like that,\" Allard said.",

The last few years have constituted a desperate bid to maintain the illusion of amateurism, and in that desperation the NCAA and the schools have turned to boosters, NIL collectives, and corporate sponsors to keep the money flowing. As a result, NIL, while nice in theory, is deeply flawed and about as lawful and orderly as the old wild west.\nMany of the problems with the current NIL system are now fully on display thanks to Matthew Sluka, the UNLV transfer who has been the starting quarterback for the Rebels during their hot 3-0 start. The team is expected to compete for the Mountain West title and now, thanks to the 12-team playoff, have a real chance at competing for the group of five slot in the bracket. Sluka, who had spent the four years prior as a dual-threat QB at FCS Holy Cross, claims that he was verbally promised $100,000 by a UNLV assistant coach to transfer over, but has only received a $3,000 relocation stipend. As a result, Sluka announced on Wednesday that he intends to redshirt and will not play for the remainder of the season.",
