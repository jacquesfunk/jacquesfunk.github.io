          "description": "Rarely does a labor fight facilitate such rich, obvious imagery, but the Park City strike provided: A disgusted Twitter user's camera shows a cluster of skiers massing at the base of a lift, huddled in at a density instantly identifiable even to the non-skier as oversaturated; as the shot pans left, we see the lift is running parallel to the cameraperson, establishing that they are not even in that clogged main line, but in fact waiting to enter its maw; finally, the up-mountain angle shows they're lucky to at least be in the front of this auxiliary line, as there are several dozen people behind them, spanning the length of cable between two support poles. Conditions, naturally, are incredible. All that new snow, and no way to get onto it.\nIt becomes very clear upon watching this clip or any of the others like it that Park City Mountain Resort cannot function without its ski patrol workers, and that the resort's owner, Vail Resorts, views both its labor force and clientele with scorn and indifference. The ongoing strike in Park City is, like any labor dispute, a discrete fight between two parties over the permissible parameters of exploitation. But it is also a fracture, a break caused by the overwhelming pressure of extractivism's ruthless logic applied past the breaking point of rationality. The long lines and the testimonies of strikebreaking skiers who had to get rescued by cut-rate scab ski patrollers are the clearest and most visually striking representations of what happens when a service-based industry is held hostage by capital until it can no longer operate as such.",

          "description": "Last night's Vikings–Lions game had been long anticipated as the perfect way to end the NFL's often turgid regular season, in that it set two longtime rivals at the peak of their historical powers against each other in a game with real stakes. The winner would get the top seed in the upcoming playoffs, a week off and all its games at home, while the loser would be dropped to the fifth seed, a game every week and all with the likelihood that they would be played at the other team's stadium, all because both teams were in the same division and only one could receive proper compensation while the other got a thumb in the eye. Reward for the victor, rules-based cruelty to the loser. What could be more deliciously unfair, or for that matter unfairly delicious?\nAnd after all that, they had already played each other in a delightful game with plenty of scoring and tenseness that left everyone limp but satisfied that their lads had done their all. Sport at its most satisfying for all involved—this would surely be that again.",

This weekend, on Twitter, people are debating how many people you should sleep with (prudes vs. enlightened). On Bluesky, the debate is over whether it is cheaper to make your own food or get delivery. I'm sick of repeats! Based on my decade of professional blogging, I can predict that next we will discuss either Irish goodbyes or washing your legs.\nAll of these discourses have, at their base, the tenor of a party question. They carry the same base-level severity as asking everyone after two beers whether they consider themselves mean or annoying. (The trick to that question is if you try to say it's complicated, you get auto-sorted into annoying). Online, the goodwill of a fun conversation evaporates instantly.

It didn't have staying power because, for whatever unexplained lights people believed they were seeing in the skies, every video posted of said lights was immediately and very easily explainable. Sir, that's clearly jets lining up to land at an airport. Governor, that's obviously Orion's Belt. Darren Rovell, that's the most airplane-looking airplane I've ever seen in my life. There may have been drones involved at some point, but the hysteria ballooned for the simple reason that, suddenly, people in one of the busiest airspaces in the world were paying attention to the night sky for the first time in their lives.\nRather than take the opportunity to mock, I think this could be a chance to educate. The night sky, even in populated, light-polluted areas, is full of interesting stuff. That stuff can be mysterious and even spooky if you don't take the time to learn what it is you're looking at.

His path took him through Erfurt, the capital of Thuringia, which had been unsettled ever since Henry's father, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, had deprived the recalcitrant but powerful duke, Henry the Lion, of many of his holdings. Scrambles to obtain those lands occurred in Saxony, Bavaria, and in Thuringia, where Archbishop Conrad and Landgrave Louis III were squabbling over Conrad's construction of a new castle in a strategically valuable—to Louis, threatening—position.

          "description": "Perhaps like their shooting percentage, the harmony and good vibes of the Vancouver Canucks were due for regression this year. Still clinging to the second Western Conference wild card spot but with a tough remaining schedule and a new batch of injuries, the Canucks are neither good enough to contend (as they were last year) nor bad enough to write off (as they were for several years before that). The on-ice product is such a slog that the only entertainment the team now provides is in the form of a purported rift between their two top centers, Elias Pettersson and J.T. Miller.\nThe simplest version of this story goes that Pettersson is passive and disengaged while Miller is intense and abrasive to the point of bullying, and because of this, they do not get along. “Petey and my relationship has come a long way. We're still working at it. We're completely different people, you know what I mean?” Miller told Sportsnet's Iain MacIntyre last February. If you’re at all familiar with hockey media’s latent Don Cherry mindset, you can guess that they tend to read the Swedish Pettersson as aloof and effete, while J.T. Miller, who gets caught swearing on the on-ice microphone roughly 15 times a season, plays his foil, the classic American red-ass who cares a lot.",

The conference reached a low point during last night's Sugar Bowl, in which Georgia was pantsed by Notre Dame. It was an odd thing, watching this Notre Dame team that lost to NIU cruise to a 23-10 victory while looking bigger and stronger than their SEC powerhouse opponents.\nYou can argue that Georgia played better than the score indicates, even while starting QB Gunner Stockton. Stockton was fine, throwing for 234 yards and one touchdown while outplaying his counterpart, Riley Leonard, who threw for just 90 yards a touchdown. The game was decided in the margins, with Georgia losing two fumbles at critical points and Notre Dame beginning the second half with a 98-yard kick return for a touchdown. Georgia was out-coached, out-schemed, and much of their season's sloppiness finally came back to bite them. Maybe their rookie QB was a deficit, but I would ask anyone making that argument to go watch some Carson Beck tape from this year.",

          "description": "It is a weird but entirely satisfactory anomaly of the first true college football national tournament that the seeding mattered exactly not at all. The lowest seed in the field is going to end up as a touchdown favorite over the highest seed remaining, three of the four semifinalists are big, name-brand schools that can be found less than 500 miles from each other, and every remaining team is a traditional powerhouse. \nIn other words, in its first attempt at a proper tournament, this most baronial of sports got the only things it ever wants, which is an emphatic reinforcement of its regional roots (plus those outworlders from Austin) and the return of Notre Dame. The rest of you can piss right off.",
